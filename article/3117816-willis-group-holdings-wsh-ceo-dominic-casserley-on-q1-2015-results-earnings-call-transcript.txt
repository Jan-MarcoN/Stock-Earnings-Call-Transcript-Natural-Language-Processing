Dominic Casserley
Welcome and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America. Iâm delighted also to welcome Nicolas Aubert, CEO of Willis GB to his first earnings call.
As I did last quarter, I want to start with an overview of the key components of our value creation strategy. I am pleased to say that our first quarter results once again saw all three pillars of our strategy in action.
First, we aimed to drive organic profit and cash flow growth through our diversified portfolio of risk advisory, brokerage and human capital and benefits businesses. Weâve got growth coming from across the group. We are focused on delivering mid single digit organic revenue growth. In parallel, we seek to manage our organic cost to create a healthy gain in organic margin.
Group organic revenue growth of 3.4% was satisfactory, given uneven conditions across the markets in which we operate. We saw underlying growth across all of our segments, with solid growth reported in many of our businesses. I will discuss this in detail in a moment.
This quarterâs results revealed great progress on our margin, as we achieved 170 basis points of positive spread between our organic commissions and fees growth and our organic expense growth. This positions us well to achieve our stated goal of at least 130 basis points of average spread for the year.
The second leg of our strategy is managing our targeted acquisitions to create value through stronger revenue performance and improved cash flow. During the quarter, our M&A strategy continued to make substantial contributions to our underlying growth. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic that we can sustain growth through our announced acquisitions.
We expect to close the Miller transaction in the middle of the year, subject to regulatory approvals. And just last week, we announced that we have made a firm offer to acquire the remaining 70% of Gras Savoye that we do not already own. We are extremely excited of the prospects of joining forces with both of these organizations. I will come back to discuss the Gras Savoye transaction at the end of our prepared remarks.
Third, we continue to transform our financial performance with our operational improvement program. This major initiative announced on this call a year ago is designed to deliver sustainable annual cost savings of $300 million beginning in 2018 with a gradual process of cost improvement each year up until then. We will reinvest a minority of the savings generated, but expect that the program will add to our underlying and organic performance each year as it started to do late last year and into this year.
Since inception, the operational improvement program has delivered about $21 million in cost savings. We are making steady progress and everyone here remains optimistic that we will achieve our goals. As previously announced, we will provide a fuller update on the program during our second quarter earnings review. Combined, these three components of our strategy are intended to drive improved cash flow and shareholder value.
Let me now turn to the quarter in more detail, starting with a discussion about Willis International. Our International operations achieved underlying commissions and fees growth in excess of 20%, an outstanding result that includes the significant impact on the segments revenues from the acquisitions of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG pension and benefits businesses over the past 12 months.
On an organic basis, International had another solid quarter, growing 5.3%. International saw very strong growth from Latin America, led by Brazil. Asia grew high single digits in the quarter, led by Global Wealth Solutions and strong Marine business. Eastern Europe, which is dominated by our Russian business, grew solidly. Expected headwinds from sanctions and economic conditions did not materialize in the quarter, however, will expect to face those headwinds throughout the remainder of the year. Western Europe grew low single digits, a good result considering the overall economic conditions across that market. The Iberia region, Norway and Ireland were the primary drivers in the quarter.
Letâs now take a look at Willis North America. Last quarter you will remember that North America was down slightly, but we told you that we expected to see improved performance in the first quarter. This occurred with North America achieving organic growth of 4.7%.
Looking at our results from a practice perspective, we saw single digit growth from our largest practice, human capital, and double-digit growth in FINEX, our second largest practice and which includes our market leading SIBA business.
From an industry perspective, real estate and hospitality led the way with double-digit growth, while construction came in at low single digits, held back somewhat by declining surety revenues. Our mergers and acquisitions business grew solidly during the quarter. Rates during the quarter were a bit of a headwind in North America as weakening rates in the property business more than offset the slight strengthening noted in the casualty business.
Now, onto Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance, which is one of two new segments, it includes Willis Re, our Capital Markets business, our Wholesale business and a new unit called Willis Portfolio and Underwriting Services which encompasses our programs on underwriting businesses.
Overall, this segmentâs organic commissions and fees were up 1.3%. The performance reflects solid results in Reinsurance, in what is the most significant quarter for revenue in our Reinsurance business. We saw declines in our Wholesale business, but relatively flat growth elsewhere compared last year.
In Reinsurance, we continue to grow our North American business at a double-digit rate, driven by continued new business success. The business was further bolstered by favorable timing of $8 million of revenue that shifted from Q2 into Q1, a result that will have a mild impact on our growth in the second quarter. The growth in North America was offset by declines in the International and specialty reinsurance businesses, where we continued to see declining rate and consolidation driving lower demand. Willis Capital Markets delivered a good performance with a number of capital raising and advisory mandates completed.
And finally, Iâd like to discuss Willis GB, our other new segment comprising our Great Britain based specialty and retail businesses. This segment is organized into four components: property and casualty, transport, financial lines and the retail network. Organic commissions and fees grew 1.1% in the quarter. This performance reflects double-digit growth in financial lines.
We also saw mid-single digit growth in property and casualty, dominated by double-digit growth in our UK large accounts. Transport was down low single digits in the quarter, as growth in aviation was more than offset by a reduction in our marine book reflecting continued low levels of new business.
Finally, retail networks were down driven by continued decline in a commercial network, due to the renegotiation of revenue terms with our network members and our insolvency business which is sensitive to improving economic conditions.
So, good overall progress in the opening quarter to 2015. Now, Iâm going to ask John to take you through the numbers in a bit more detail. Then Iâll return to talk about acquisitions. John?
John Greene
Thank you, Dominic. Good morning to those on the call. I'll be working on the first quarter slide deck which is available on our website.
On slide 3, youâll see our traditional EPS line. This shows we started 2015 with a solid performance, driven by a combination of revenue growth and continued progress against our expense management goals, including those of the operational improvement programs. These two factors combined to drive organic margin expansion.
On foreign exchange, during our last call, we indicated that if rates remained exactly where they were as of December 31, FX would pressure our EPS by between $0.03 and $0.07 for the full year of 2015. We also flagged that FX would pressure the first half of the yearâs results and would then ease in the second half.
As you know, currency rates have moved since December 31. In fact, during the first quarter, the euro declined 13% versus the dollar, while the pound fell by 5%. That contributed to $0.15 negative impact on EPS in the quarter. We expect the pressure from FX movements will abate in the second half of the year, actually reversing to a degree in the third quarter. So if you assume no movements in foreign currency rates from March 31, we now expect the full year impact from FX to be a headwind of $0.10 to $0.13 per share.
Overall, we continued the trend from last quarter. Good organic revenue growth and returns from our M&A strategy, coupled with our cost management initiatives created a $0.08 positive movement in EPS. Finally, our reported EPS includes restructuring costs related to the operational improvement program. This amounted to $31 million or $0.12 per share in the quarter. That was partially offset by the $0.01 gain from an office sale.
Turning to slide 4, as a reminder, the difference between reported and underlying for each segment is foreign exchange movement and the difference between underlying and organic is the net impact from acquisitions and disposals. Encouragingly, excluding the foreign exchange headwinds, we had commission and fee growth on both an organic and underlying basis across each segment during the quarter.
FX headwinds are clear when you look at the difference in reported and underlying C&F growth in Willis GB, Willis CWR and Willis International. This was driven primarily by the depreciation in the euro against the dollar, sterling and the Latin American currencies also contributed to a lesser degree.
Two further points to note. First, Internationalâs underlying results reflect the impact of the 2014 acquisitions of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG business, adding about $38 million to revenue in the quarter. Second, North Americaâs underlying results reflects revenue lost from portfolio management actions taken in 2014. In the current quarter, we sold our Omaha, Nebraska office. The result is reflected in other operating income as a $4 million gain. Weâve discussed our portfolio optimization over the past few quarters and we now have largely completed those actions in North America.
Letâs turn to a walkthrough of our expenses on slide 5. Here, you can see our cost management initiatives are gaining traction as we cap our organic expense growth under 2%. Foreign currency movements favorably impacted total expenses by $48 million in the quarter. As you might expect, the biggest driver was the euro depreciation against the dollar. Underlying expenses grew by $40 million, of which $29 million related to our M&A activities.
Included in this result were the initial costs associated with the proposed Gras Savoye acquisition amounting to about $4 million. We also saw the benefit of our operational improvement program. For the quarter, cost savings from the program totaled $10 million. We expect the quarterly savings from the program to increase especially in the second half of the year. Program cost in the quarter totaled $31 million, reflecting termination benefits, parallel running costs and professional fees. Overall, we continue to make strong progress against our goals for the program.
Additionally, expenses in the quarter benefited from a $10 million increase in the pension expense credit. This is the result of actuarial gains and a freeze on pensionable salaries in the UK defined benefit plan implemented in March.
Slide six takes you through salary and benefit expense. On an organic basis, S&B was up 3.3% to $544 million. This was slightly above our global inflation expectation that reflects a 1% increase in organic headcount as well as inflationary pressure in Latin America and other markets, significantly impacted by inflation or currency devaluation. We also had higher incentives in the quarter following strong performances in several businesses. Underlying S&B grew $34 million or 6.4% to $567 million. This includes a $17 million increase from M&A, roughly half the total growth in the quarter.
Turning to slide 7, this shows our onshore and offshore FTE trends over the past 12 months on an organic basis. Our numbers reflect our continued focus on headcount management and on relocating FTEs to lower cost regions. As weâve mentioned before, the parallel running of rolls associated with the operational improvement program will mean temporary FTE growth in some quarters.
Organic FTEs are therefore up around 1% year over year, but onshore, the number of FTEs is actually down about 300 over the same period. That means that the increase in organic FTEs is all within our low cost offshore operation in Mumbai. Over the long term, this will optimize our cost structure, while supporting our growth goals.
On slide 8, you see our underlying EBITDA was $360 million in the first quarter, up nearly 6% year over year. The growth was broadly evenly split between organic sources and acquisitions. Overall, our underlying EBITDA performance reflects the positive impact of our acquisitions strategy and provides a mid single digit organic C&F growth and strong execution on our cost initiatives.
A year ago in the first quarter of 2014, our underlying EBITDA grew $5 million year over year. This current quarter reflects a $20 million improvement. This illustrates the progress we are making.
Now, let me briefly comment on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Overall, we are confident that we are well positioned to achieve our stated goals for the year. These include: mid single digit organic revenue growth, at least 130 basis point spread between organic C&F and expense growth, and approximately $55 million to $65 million of EBITDA from acquisitions, subject to the timing of Millerâs closing.
We also said the timing of the positive organic spread will be weighted to the second half of the year. That is because, as Dominic mentioned in his commentary, we are facing uneven market conditions which affect the first quarter and will also impact the second quarter and because we expect our operational improvement program savings will gather pace in the second half of the year. We will navigate these near-term headwinds and believe that we are on track to achieve our full-year target.
Before I turn it back to Dominic, Iâd like to take a minute to walk you through some of the financial for the proposed acquisition of Gras Savoye on slide 9. On a US GAAP basis, Gras Savoye generated approximately â¬370 million of revenues in 2014 and approximately â¬65 million of EBITDA, producing a 17.6% margin. The two pie charts at the bottom of the slide break out Gras Savoyeâs revenues, first by geography and second by product lines.
By geography, you observe a fairly even split between the three divisions of Paris, regions and international, including Africa. By product, while property and casualty is the majority of the business, you see that a sizable portion is in what we view as their high growth human capital and benefits practice. Importantly, that company continues to have strong growth prospects.
Q1 is historically Gras Savoyeâs biggest quarter by revenues and in 2015 it continued to perform well, growing by strong mid single digits. We expect its underlying margin will expand in 2015 and we see excellent opportunities to drive revenue synergies post acquisition.
From a financial perspective, we believe weâve added substantially to our capabilities at a valuation given the momentum of the business in 2015. We expect the transaction to close by December 31, subject to regulatory and worker councils reviews. If it closes at that time, we expect it to be $0.06 to $0.08 dilutive on our reported EPS in 2016, mildly dilutive in 2018 and accretive in 2018. Excluding the impact of amortization expense, we see the transaction as being accretive in the range of $0.13 to $0.17 per share in 2016.
Now, I will turn the call back to Dominic to cover the strategic aspects of the transaction and wrap up the call.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you, John. As I discussed before, strategic acquisitions are a key aspect of our growth strategy and we continue to make progress, having both high-quality businesses in 2014 to further strengthen our client proposition and our growth prospects. We have continued our progress on this strategy with the announcement of the proposed Miller and Gras Savoye transactions. Today, Iâd like to talk more about Gras Savoye and what it means for Willis.
Take a look at slide 10. First, the remainder of some of what Gras Savoye would bring to the combined firm. A strong footprint in France, where it is the largest broker and where it holds a strong market share in French large accounts and enjoys a leading position in the midmarket sector. The expertise and reach to serve multinationals including in France which is home to 31 of the Fortune Global 500, a number that ranks it fourth globally and first in Europe; access to high-growth economies and insurance markets, including Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and a comprehensive network of 42 offices in 31 countries across Africa; strong property and casualty product capabilities and employee benefit products.
In the graph, you see that our network of wholly owned country operations in a combined Willis Gras Savoye would double in size from 42 pre-acquisition to 84. We believe this transaction would give us one of the largest wholly owned country networks in our industry, further enhancing Willisâ ability to serve the needs of the multinational corporations around the world.
Let me conclude with these points on the transaction and our strategy has a whole. This union would be the next step in a long standing relationship that has spanned decades. Over the decade, we have worked closely many times as a joint force to win business. We have strong ties and let relationships with the management team and many of the terrific Gras Savoye employees around the world. It is our belief that combining the entities into one fully integrated company will allow us to continue to add value to client offerings, provide great opportunities for employees of both firms and then help us to build shareholder value into the future.
Finally, let me return to where we started, our strategy. As I said, you see all three pillars of our strategy in action in this quarterâs results: organic growth through our diversified portfolio, strategic M&A, and operational improvement. It is this deliberate and determined approach that is enabling us to sustain good momentum overall in an external context of uneven economic performance and a challenging rate environment.
Going forward, we remain confident in our prospects and believe we are well positioned to achieve our stated goals for the year. The three elements of our strategy come together to drive growth in earnings, improve our margins and increase cash flow, with the overall aspiration to bring value to our shareholders.
And now, Iâll turn the call over to question-and-answers. Over to the operator.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Cliff Gallant from Nomura.
Cliff Gallant
Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the 170 basis points spread you achieved this quarter between organic revenues and expenses. Were there any one time items that might have been driving that, because I notice in your comments that you said that you were beginning to see the operational improvements come into effect?
John Greene
Actually looking at the balance of what happened, so we certainly performed well on the top line. So the organic growth coming in at 3.4% supplemented by the acquisition certainly helped. We did have a movement as Dominic mentioned in his commentary of a particular reinsurance contract that historically is booked in the second quarter, booked in the first quarter.
We actually had more, on the expense side we had more pressure from the Gras Savoye due diligent cost that I mentioned of $4 million, we also had about $3 million of cost related to Miller that came through. We expect little bit more to come through when the transaction closes. So no significant one-offs, there is a little bit of timing and weâre in a pretty good position I think.
Cliff Gallant
Given that performance in this first quarter, just wanted to confirm your statements that you still feel that the second half will be stronger than the first half?
John Greene
Yes. We thought about those statements carefully. Obviously we gave annual guidance as part of the fourth quarter earnings call, weâre going to stick with that earnings guidance and weâre going to manage to it. And if the top line continues and our expense base continues to be managed as we have, we see that weâre going to deliver the 130 basis points and possibly a little bit of upside on that.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan
The first question, just want to clarify, John, your comments on the full year impact foreign exchange, you said if the currency stay the same as the quarter end, the foreign currency impact for the full year will be $0.10 to $0.13, is that inclusive of $0.15 negative impact which imply the remaining of the year you would have the benefit from it, or just second quarter to the fourth quarter of this year?
John Greene
As we talked, $0.15 negative impact on the first quarter, the range I gave was a full year impact, so we see if the rates remain exactly where there were as of March 31, I want to emphasize that point because we do know that rates have moved in April a little bit, actually the euro strengthened marginally, but if they were to remain exactly where they were as of March 31, we would see that a range of $0.10 to $0.13 for the full year.
Kai Pan
Then the second question is on the...
John Greene
The improvement happens in the third quarter. We see a pick up in the third quarter just based on the flow of the revenues coming through.
Kai Pan
So itâd be a positive impact, actually improvements in the third quarter?
John Greene
Yes.
Kai Pan
Second question on acquisition impact on the margin, you showed pretty strong organic margin improvement, 120 basis points, but if you look at underlying margin improvement is only like 10, 20 basis points. So I guess the difference between those two numbers are from some drag from the acquisition or dispositions, could you talk a little bit more about that and whatâs potential drag if any from the acquisition going forward, like Miller and Gras Savoye?
Dominic Casserley
Yes. So the organic obviously strips out the acquisitions, so 12 months of acquisition revenue and expenses and operating income. The difference between organic and underlying therefore is the acquisitions and what we ended up buying are companies with margins that are slightly lower than what Willis has posted and that results in a lower margin, but we also paid a valuation when we bought those companies that reflected the margin rates that the company has had.
And obviously weâre managing them and we expect to drive some synergies over the longer term, but itâs not going to happen immediately. So that does impact. There is also the impact of amortization that comes through, so the difference between the net assets and the purchase price that comes through and that impacts the underlying numbers.
Steve Hearn
Iâd like to step in here and add to this, remember, we are very focused on growing our cash flow and EBITDA and so when we are buying businesses what weâre really focused on is their impact on our cash flow over time and growing our cash flow, which is a combination of the value of those franchises and the profits they are moving today and our ability to improve those over time.
And what we are already seeing is that the businesses we have bought continue to perform well in their part of the Willis family and we see significant revenue and cost synergies over time from many of them. So we already focused on the medium term, in fact immediate and medium-term impact on the cash flow generation. And so far everything is very positive.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis
I think my first question is for John and itâs actually on the pension side, on the UK pension, I know the vast majority of pension contributions are coming from the UK and I think the 10-K indicated you are currently negotiating a new funding arrangement with the planâs trustees. And I think at least on a US GAAP basis that plan looks overfunded, I guess Iâm just curious where are we in those negotiations, could they have any real impact on cash flow going forward or potentially could they bring down that profit share above $900 million of EBITDA that you guys pointed to in the K?
John Greene
So we are having ongoing conversations with the trustees, so I really canât get into much detail in terms of the funding arrangement. The key impact for the quarter, however, was freezing the pension, so basically the impact of that is participantsâ salary increases arenât reflected in the defined benefit calculation going forward on their retirement or exit from the company.
And if you take a look at the balance sheet on page 12 of the press release, it shows that the pension benefit has actually moved materially, almost $300 million, and that related to frankly the valuation as a result of freezing it. So there will be some income benefit for Willis over the next seven, eight years in terms of amortization of expense or cost of the pension.
The actuarial deficit also changed materially as a result freezing those pension benefits. So we think that we are in a fairly good position in terms of where we are from an accounting and a business perspective. Itâs really important that we treat our people fairly and create a fair outcome for our people in terms of ensuring the pension is funded appropriately. But there are those contingencies associated with the funding arrangements that were implemented about three years ago that we are looking to mitigate over time. But we will see how the conversations go with the trustees.
Ryan Tunis
And then switching back over to Gras real quick, on the guidance you guys gave us last week and just reiterated this morning, I guess, what are you guys assuming in terms of revenue growth or margin expansion there, I think you said you think you can grow margins in the 50, whatâs going into that guidance?
Dominic Casserley
Let me turn that over to Tim Wright who has been leading our discussions with Gras Savoye and led to the announcement last week. Tim?
Tim Wright
Couple of things. You asked about the momentum of the business in 2015 and then also what we see as future growth opportunities over time. I think as we said earlier, 2015 Gras Savoye will not be part of the Group according to the plan, they will become part of the Group beginning of 2016.
We see positive momentum in both top line and bottom line and margin in Gras Savoye in 2015 as evidenced by very strong first quarter, which as you know is the largest quarter by far of Gras Savoye, it gets about 40% of the revenues of Gras Savoye come in the first quarter. So they have really positive momentum in the first quarter 2015.
In terms of revenue opportunities over time, given the complementary nature of our two businesses, weâre now where weâre not and the combination creates the opportunity for us to grow jointly as a result. We see substantial revenue opportunities over time once theyâre part of the Group, bringing our collective capabilities to bet and combining our footprint.
In terms of precise numbers, weâre working with through our plans with respect to what that would mean financially, so itâs too early to say. They wonât be part of the Group until the end of the year, but we think there is significant incremental growth opportunity from the combination.
Ryan Tunis
And then I just had one more quick one for John, just in terms of how to think about the funding for this deal, I think in the slide you said likely funded with debt, I mean if you could just help us with that thought maybe in the last quarter you were hoping it would mainly be cash and a letter of credit, I donât know if there is a change there, just how are you thinking about funding mix, rating agency considerations, et cetera?
John Greene
So rates are actually at a fantastic level to fund a transaction like this. We are exploring options. The one option that is probably predominant at this time is a euro bond, probably sometime in the fourth quarter and the order of magnitude could be somewhere between $500 million and $600 million. Weâre going to continue to explore other options, we have the RCF with $800 million capability there, we havenât touched it. I donât think thatâs a good way to fund a long-term transaction. So we will look at our cash position when we get closer to closing and make a call. But as I said, I think it will be something between $500 million and $600 million and where it stands right now, if rates remain where they are, it might be a euro bond.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes from SunTrust.
Mark Hughes
The organic growth target or spread of 130 basis points, have you calculated on an underlying basis given the profile of the acquisitions, what does that translate into for the spread growth there, again on the underlying business?
John Greene
We gave guidance on an organic basis and Iâm a little bit hesitant right now to provide some additional enhanced guidance on an underlying basis, given weâre going to have some transaction costs coming through and the impact of amortization on these transactions. So 130 basis points organic is pretty good, you know the pipeline in terms of the two significant transactions that we got to close. So I would say user data we provided and it should give you a pretty good indication on the underlying numbers.
And I think whatâs positive about where our underlying spread will move, but obviously the timing of when Miller closes and the big thing there, of course, is the accelerated amortization which affects heavily the short-term underlying spread you see, so thatâs why weâre hesitant to give that. Weâve given clear guidance on what we think we can do organically than the timing around some of the closing that some of these transactions is going to have an effect on how the amortization goes through.
Mark Hughes
And then you talked about the positive impact of increasing the pension, the $10 million increase in pension benefit credit, was that part of that benefit, you saw some of that this quarter, is that right?
John Greene
We did, yes.
Mark Hughes
And then the volatility in the US, you had a very nice improvement this quarter. It seems like thatâs been pretty mobile, a lot of movement in those numbers. You think that will stabilize, were those some unique circumstances the last few quarters, should we expect more consistency perhaps in North America?
Dominic Casserley
Let me turn over to Todd Jones just to give you a sense of whatâs going on in the States. Todd?
Todd Jones
I think as we had talked about last quarter, we had some unique circumstances that we thought werenât going to repeat the impact of the quarter and then obviously we saw the business return to what we consider sort of more normal performance this quarter. As we looked through the balance of the year, and I think we mentioned the rating environment continues to be a headwind having just returned from wins, I donât think anything Iâve heard there would suggest that that rating environment is going to improve anytime in the near term.
But we are still very optimistic about the growth prospects of the business. Certainly, the industry strategy, we are very happy that construction came back to growth and our human capital and benefits business performed well in the quarter as well. So still bullish on the full year, we got a lot of challenges from a rating environment, but I think we can continue to grow sustainably.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.
Brian Meredith
A couple of quick questions here for you. First, just on the tax rate 22 and change in the quarter, is that a good go forward rate or is it a little bit low given mix of revenues and earnings in the quarter?
John Greene
I think itâs lower than the guidance we gave, during the Q&A in the December call, related to December results, I mentioned something around 25%. And in the quarter, we benefited from the mix of revenue as well as the strengthening of provision on our balance sheet that we are able to release. So I would think in terms of a range, 25% and obviously itâs an important piece of the income statement and we continue to look at.
Brian Meredith
And then just a clarification, the $10 million pension benefit, that was all in this quarter and thatâs heavily impacted the other operating expenses and is there any â and what is the GAAP impact weâll see here going forward from the freeze in the pension benefit earnings going forward?
John Greene
The benefit is reflected in S&B, so itâs part of employee benefits. And the $10 million is a year over year change and some of that, as I said in my prepared script, related to frankly the actuarial view of our interest income our earnings from the pension and the other piece had to do with the freeze. So we can expect for the year, this first quarter here, is better than the â $10 million better. Going forward, the way we are looking at, itâs likely to repeat.
Brian Meredith
So we should continue to see a $10 million benefit for the next several quarters?
John Greene
Thereabouts. It could be slightly more, it could be slightly less.
Brian Meredith
Just on the revenue side, in the wholesale businesses, I know the energy markets have been pretty weak, Gulf of Mexico energy, would that impact the second quarter, when does that likely to impact results and should we expect some pressure on organic revenue growth in that area as a result in the second quarter?
Dominic Casserley
Let me start having Steve Hearn talk about that any may Nicolas might want to add. But let me have Steve start talking about the energy outlook.
Steve Hearn
Energy is obviously something significant to Willis around the world, with our Russian business earlier has impact there, it certainly has impact in our London business in Nicolasâ area and in Toddâs business for that matter. So whatâs going on in the energy market is something we clearly follow very closely.
One of the things, the way I think about this is this doesnât necessarily correlate volatility in the energy market in terms of our earnings. And if fact, if we go back to previous energy crisis, the actual impact on our earnings was relatively negligible, modest impact. It takes a long time for construction projects to actually start and get more full, construction continues to develop in the energy sector.
At the moment, we see â and then obviously there is operational risk which continues to be active. So we are watching it closely, donât see anything particularly spiky and I think certainly at the moment all of those businesses that Iâve mentioned are continuing to perform well in the energy area. That is more than anyone else would like.

The next question is from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker
I just want to talk about the growth rates a little bit on the different segments, it was mentioned that you had the negative 2% in North America followed by plus 4%, last quarter you had a plus 15% international, now you have plus 5% and then you had the 2Q transactions and the 1Q transaction, in 1Q in wholesales and capital and reinsurance, and you also mentioned the impact of sanctions going forward for international. Iâm wondering if you can take the 1Q growth rate numbers and sort of give us a little bit of thoughts on what might be a normalized version and whether youâd take the 1Q growth rate for the individual segment as close to normalized?
Dominic Casserley
First of all, let me make the following overall point. We are deliberately building a diversified specialty businesses, across where we complete, so weâre deepening our markets geographically and in our product lines, we have specialists who have leading market franchises. And we therefore have a diversified portfolio of businesses, which at any one time [indiscernible] which give us confidence about the overall growth rate weâre going to achieve from the Group. Because we are diverse, we have strength and diversification. Now, with that as a background, letâs focus first on international, because we did have that very large fourth quarter last year. And have Tim just talk to us about the international story. Tim?
Tim Wright
First of all on the fourth quarter, 15% growth, we were very pleased with that, but we did cool out that it benefited from some year-on-year comparables and that actually if you excluded that it was probably more like 11% which we were still very pleased with. And the full year number was more like 9% overall for the last year and then again if you still step back to fourth quarter comparables, probably 7%, 7.5%. That gives you an indication of what the last year was.
Q1 results at over 5% is in line with what weâve seen in the past for the first quarter and weâre confident that puts us in a good place for the rest of the year. On Russia, which you called out, obviously we have a fabulous business in Russia, a great market position and benefited from that in the past and talked to that about in the past.
Clearly, the combination of sanctions which have restricted the capital market and hence project business which is a large part of our portfolio is a pressure. And the decline of the ruble impacting the FX impact, does impact asset values. We actually had a good first quarter in Russia, but we do expect some pressure from that to come over the remainder of the year, but we still feel positive about the overall results of international of the full year.
Sorry, go ahead again?
Josh Shanker
Can Russia move you by 100 basis points one way or the other in that segment?
Tim Wright
As Dominic said, in the same way the group has the benefit of a portfolio effect, so does the international business. So in any given year, weâll have some businesses that are performing very strongly and others that are a bit more challenged and the portfolio effect helps us to average those out.
Dominic Casserley
And Josh clearly another point on that side, for 2016, the portfolio effect will be even stronger with the addition of Miller and the addition of Gras Savoye. So weâre again adding specialist capabilities in those markets in Miller for a specialized position in the wholesale markets in London, but further diversifying our exposure to any one particular market. Now, where else would you like us to go, I think weâve covered the United States.
Josh Shanker
The reinsurance transactions that you did in this quarter that was normally booked in 2Q, I assume that had some impact or might be a slight drag on 2Q?
Dominic Casserley
I think we said that, this is a reinsurance booking. Steve, do you want to talk a bit more on that?
Josh Shanker
Do you have a number around that?
Steve Hearn
So as John mentioned in his prepared script, thatâs an $8 million number for us, short timing, something that historically had always turned up in Q2 turned up in Q1, so be benefited from it and it will absolutely have an impact on Q2 for that segment for sure.
Operator
Our next question is from Dan Farrell from Piper Jaffray.
Dan Farrell
With some of the upcoming M&A, I was wondering if you could just remind us of what your tolerances are in terms of increases to debt leverage and maybe you could just relate it to either a net debt to EBITDA on interest coverage, how do you think about where you can go on those measures.
Dominic Casserley
Let me start and then I am going to hand it over to John. Our overall view is on acquisitions overall, let me remind you, is that weâre focused on specialized franchises either geographically or by line of business. And secondly, very, very importantly, institutions and people because what we are really buying is people here and their talent, who really want to become part of Willis and that requires long-term conversations, not always as long as decades, weâve been in conversations with Gras Savoye, but certainly for a long period of time and largely leads us away from optioned situations, but instead exclusive conversations. So thatâs our philosophy.
Once we have those assets, we then look out very carefully at our financial capability and flexibility. Youâve heard John talk about driving things from cash and cash flow, and then debt either revolver which we tend not to think of as the appropriate source for long-term funding, and in the long term markets which at the moment are at an interesting set of levels. And then of course, in that context, we donât worry about our overall credit rating and a position with our creditors and the financial markets. And we broadly been operating within the context of remaining investment grade. Thatâs our broad philosophy.
Now, let me hand over to John to give a bit more detail on that.
John Greene
The specifics around covenants, there is plenty of room on the covenant, so we were â from a debt to EBITDA standpoint, weâre at 2.6 as of the end of the year. If we were to fund the Gras Savoye transaction with debt, that could go up to 2.9 and we see a horizon where it drops back down to 2.6 in a relatively short amount of time. So within 24 to 30 months. So weâre comfortable with that. Our bank covenants are 3.2, between 3.25 and 3.5, depending on the particular nature of whatâs driving that EBITDA and debt. So weâre well within threshold and we continue to manage it as Dominic mentioned.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Mr. Adam Klauber from William Blair.
Adam Klauber
Iâm not sure if you said, will Miller be accretive next year?
John Greene
We covered that on the previous call, so from a cash EPS, it definitely will be and I think for next year we said, I donât have the details in front of me, but I think we said it was about neutral or slightly up on an underlying basis. So strongly positive from a cash EPS basis and basically flat from an underlying basis, which includes the amortization.
Adam Klauber
It should be margin accretive on an EBITDA or cash basis do you think?
John Greene
Flattish I think broadly.
Adam Klauber
And then one follow-up on the difference between underlying operating margin and organic, as we think about modeling off that base, should we think about modeling, so first quarter this year the underlying margin was 29.8% whereas organic operating margin was 30.7%, what is the starting point, is it 29.8% or the 30.7%?
John Greene
Could you just repeat that question so we are absolutely clear, when you say starting point, starting point for what?
Adam Klauber
So when weâre modeling for next year, so weâre thinking about will the margin increase from first quarter 2015 to the first quarter 2016, should our starting point 29.8% or the 30.7%?
John Greene
Let me start by saying, the one piece of guidance we have given you and the only piece of guidance we have given you on margin is related to our organic margin, whatâs going to happen to difference between our organic revenues and organic expenditures, right. And that we have said will â there will be a 130 basis points or more spread between those two numbers in 2015. As I think we tried to answer an earlier question, translating that precisely into what happens to the underlying margin, well of course it would be supportive of the underlying margin significantly.
The timing of acquisitions of when they come in and when the amortization starts to flow through and exactly how we fund those acquisitions short-term versus long-term, therefore that the debt cost will be makes it a little harder to translate that immediately into what the underlying increase in margin will be in 2015 because of that reason. Thatâs why when we gave you guidance on what would happen to spread between revenues and cost, we focused you on organic because of all the complications which just flow through in timing issues et cetera on underlying.
Operator
Our next question is from Mr. Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital.
Bob Glasspiegel
Two questions. First is on cash flow which despite some pretty good EBITDA trends, the first quarter was negative $64 million from operations versus plus $5 million, timing was impacted that?
Dominic Casserley
John, why donât you talk about the cash flow factor.
John Greene
I will. So when we look at where we were 2014 to 2015, so the difference was a deterioration of about $69 million and there were largely four components driving that. So there was the cash impact of the operational improvement program that was about $20 million. There were year over year increased contributions to the defined benefit plan of $16 million. There were translation impact from operating income from the FX coming through which amounted to about $20 million. And then the change in the balance sheet was about $10 million. So that explains the operating cash flow year over year.
In terms of the movements from December 31 to March 31, the first quarter is a big quarter with incentive payments. So we accrue as the year goes on, but actually the cash that goes out the door, majority of it happens in the first quarter and thatâs really the driver of that decrease in cash when you look at 12/31 to March 31.
Bob Glasspiegel
And if I could just, one follow-up on Gras Savoye, recognizing that my math maybe off because you donât give us enough details to get this fully, it looks like youâre paying EBITDA of about 12 times and a PE of about 20 times, accepting earnings EPS dilution for cash flow positives, Gras Savoye looks like your equity of affiliates sort of declined for the quarter, I assume currency is the explanation between Gras Savoye had a good first quarter versus reporting a down in total for affiliates, but the question is thereâs not much organic growth visible in earnings for Gras Savoye and youâre paying them a very high valuation from a EPS perspective. Are we going to talk in terms of cash earnings instead of EPS going forward given the dislocation of the two?
Dominic Casserley
So let me start and then Iâm going to hand over to Tim and then Iâm probably going to end up with John. So let me start with a generic point. We have been watching with some interest some of the commentary around the price we are paying for Gras Savoye. Obviously we are paying at the end of 2015 for this transaction.
We would have thought the normal thing for people to do would be to be looking at either trailing 12 months which would be 2015 or even forward looking performance of the business. Occasionally weâve seen people taking the 2014 number and translate into, which strikes me as a bit odd. So we do not believe we are paying 12 times EBITDA for this business. Let me be very clear on that. And our calculations are nowhere near that sort of number.
But in terms of the performance of the business and how itâs performing and outlook, let me hand over to Tim and then hand over to John to talk about cash EPS, how weâre thinking about that? So Tim?
Tim Wright
So first thing to say, the way in which we calculated the price was broadly in line with the formula in our existing shareholder agreement, which is a document of public record that that is a formula thatâs based on a combination of revenue and EBITDA for 2014 and 2015. Obviously by accelerating in making a [indiscernible] we have taken a view on 2015 based on the experience at the beginning of the year and our best estimates for the remainder of the year.
Into that calculation and into your thinking, you should factor the fact that 2015 looks very good as I said earlier in full respects, so we saw an improvement in 2014 in terms of revenue growth and margin expansion and we see more of that from the experience of the first quarter which is the largest.
And then in terms of the associated line, youâre absolutely right, the associated line is predominantly Gras Savoye and that was lower than you would expect, given that forward momentum due to FX and the other, the performance of our other associates which was principally around timing. So you shouldn't join the dots on the associated line and 2015 performance to conclude that the performance is down and that's what we've made.
John Greene
On the associated line, there was about $3 million of FX that hit that, so you strip that out and on an underlying basis, you are up about 8% there. So good performance in the quarter. In terms of cash EPS and how we're thinking about the business, looking at the past 12 months in terms of some of the things we did in terms of breaking out underlying and organic and reported in trying to create some symmetry there and consistency.
The idea of adding a new metric in this year I thought would create frankly some confusion in the marketplace and given the timing of the transaction and some noncash items that are likely to happen, as we mentioned the valuation reserve could be reversed at some point in the second half of the year. My feeling was cash EPS is definitely the right way to go, but not likely in 2015, certainly for 2016, with seem to make a lot of sense with the Gras Savoye transaction and Miller committed.
Operator
Our next question is from Mr. Thomas Mitchell from Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell
I just wanted to look at the restructuring cost and you may have gone over this before in concept, but I just wanted to double check it, as we model, since we are looking at a period that has roughly 4 years to run, maybe a little bit less, for the operating improvement program and then it would seem to me that if you have a planned process for the restructuring cost, you might be able to give us an idea of what that would look like quarter by quarter, some sort of guidance on how that would look, maybe the $31 million from this quarter is much higher than what it will be in the first quarter of 2018, but it might be helpful in between to have some sort of indication of how that's expected to go?
John Greene
As I think we said we are going to give you a pretty full update on how we see the operational improvement program progressing and how we see it flowing through our financials in our second quarter earnings update in July where we will address many of these issues.
Frankly, not to press that conversation, but getting into quarter by quarter exactly how the restructuring expenses will flow as we look out into 2016 and 2017 is a little difficult to do. I think we can do it at an annual level, but the details of exactly when the particular level are running and other cost will actually fall when we start looking out, it gets a little hard to be that precise looking two years ahead. But bear with us and we will give you a full update of where we are and how we see this flowing through our financials in July.
Thomas Mitchell
Now my second question is just I think I understand it, but I just wanted to double check. Essentially what you are giving us with organic is same-store, it's the equivalent of same-store results, which means that an acquisition once it's actually been in the fold for 15 months becomes part of the same-store base and the disposition obviously is moved out of the same-store base, so that when we are looking at organic numbers in the future we don't really have to worry about what is the right number for the percentage, for instance your percentage, once you have had an acquisition for over a year, your percentage changes in operating profit margin are going to be tied to what the same-store base was, i.e., including Gras Savoye, sometime let say in 2017 and so on. Do I have that right?
Dominic Casserley
You broadly do. I think the same store analogy is not a bad one. Let me hand over to John to make sure the precision of what we're doing out there is clear to you.
John Greene
You're probably right. It is same-store concept, but the one nuance to the definition would be 12 months after an acquisition is closed or disposal, 12 months of activity from that acquisition out of organic, so that we can get a pure view for the 12 months. After 12 months, it becomes part of organic and logically that makes sense because you activate your integration activities and it really becomes embedded within your operations.
Operator
Our next question is from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen
You may have addressed this with some of your earlier comments, but you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Dominic, facing uneven markets, I think that was the term you used, in the first half and those should get better in the second half. I wasn't quite sure what you were referring to?
Dominic Casserley
I was just referring to the conditions, I think Jay, that you're very, very familiar with, which is everyone knows that the reinsurance markets are interesting with consolidation of the large ends and pricing pressure around particularly Florida cat, the access of alternative capital. I think Todd talked about the fact that we've seen flattish rate slightly down, something is up in North America and something is slightly down, some markets we see, aviation rates continue to be challenging et cetera, so we're seeing that.
I don't think I necessarily said that they are going to go away in the second half of the year. I don't think we are saying that at all. We continue to believe and I think I said many, many times on calls that we never budget or operate on the basis that we will be in a hard market. We believe that what's going on in our markets, yes, there are ups and downs, but across our diversified portfolio that would be a mistake to budget or act on that basis. But we are seeing particular some of our segments, we are seeing some of that rate pressure and you'll start seeing that in some of the relative growth rates between some of our segments.
On the other hand, we benefit from some markets which are stronger and growing. E.g., we continue to see good growth in our human benefits practice, in some of our international markets we are continuing to see good growth in our market share and in some pricing. So that's what I meant. But I think I was trying to particularly signal that some of our segments during the course of the year are facing a year-on-year pricing differential, which you are seeing in our results. But again, our diversified portfolio of specialty businesses gives us the ongoing ability to deliver single digit organic revenue growth.
Operator
Our next question is from Meyer Shields from KBW.
Meyer Shields
Just two quick questions, if I can. One, I think this is for John, the $10 million savings on the pension, assuming that's a rough quarterly run rate, was that contemplated in the 130 basis point revenue expense spread?
John Greene
Yes, about half of it. We hadnât froze the pension, the UK pension at the time, we didnât know for certain what the impact would be on that.
Meyer Shields
And second, and I apologize this is a little awkward, but there's been some news obviously about some defections in London to a competitor. And I don't want to get into legal aspect of it, but should we model some sort of revenue you back from that?
John Greene
I will answer the second part of your question. Obviously, we are somewhat constrained by the fact that we are in the middle of legal proceedings in this situation. Let me give you some general points and then answer the specific. I don't intend to get into details of the case, but let me be very clear to everyone and to you listening that we will always pursue legal against individuals and companies where we believe an awful action has compromised the interest of our clients, our staff, the carriers we work with and our shareholders. And we intend to pursue this particular case vigorously to try for the maximum recovery.
Secondly, we are committed to investing and continually improving our offering to the fine arts and jewelry and BC clients that you were talking about and we appointed a new global CEO of that business, Seth Peller, he is enthusiastically being supported by our organization and by associated organizations and we intend to grow that business very significantly. As to the overall size of the business we are talking about, as part of the whole of Willis very small.
Operator
Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.
Mike Nannizzi
A couple of really quick ones. Just wanted to confirm, I just want to make sure I have this right, so we should be expecting a $0.02 tailwind to our earnings for the remainder of the year from FX, is that right?
John Greene
Yes. I would take this one, the answer is yes, likely to be in the third quarter.
Mike Nannizzi
And then as far as thinking about salary and benefits, just want to make sure I am thinking about this right, the $8 million timing on the reinsurance contract in North America, should we be thinking about taking that out when comparing salary and benefit growth to organic or is there some salary and benefit element in that $8 million number?
Dominic Casserley
I think we were referring to a revenue item, but let me have Steve clarify that.
Steve Hearn
Thatâs right, Dominic. Itâs an $8 million revenue within a year wonât impact the year, itâs quarter to quarter.
Mike Nannizzi
I guess my point is if organic growth was 3.4% and then if we back that out then organic would be like 2.5%, 2.5% or something, versus the organic salary and benefit of 3.3%, should we be thinking about it that way and then should we expect that to flip around in the second quarter or it is not how we should be looking at it?
John Greene
I think the way I would look at it is I will take a look at the total year and in a particular quarter depending on the nature of the particular incentive plan and the geography could result in an increase in incentives recognized in the quarter and then there are certain triggers when businesses achieve production awards beyond a certain level that create accelerated. So the concept of trying to do this on a quarterly basis with a degree of precision especially when you don't have the level of access and obviously folks in the company, would be really hard.
So in terms of that $8 million issue, I would look at that as a total year, it doesn't change the total year dynamics. The reason we flagged it was we wanted to make sure you had a view in terms of what was driving the first quarter and give you some insight into the second quarter.
Dominic Casserley
Let me just reiterate a couple of things that may have just got lost with the overlay speech there. When John was confirming the $0.02 tailwind for FX over the course of the rest of the year, that was assuming March 31 rates, which is what you said, John, but that's what the assumption is there.
Secondly, a general point that, we do really try to get you focused on the trend in our cash flow looking on an annual basis, things move around each quarter. There are timing issues each quarter which can affect numbers, we are trying to get â we gave you guidance for the year in terms of that spread for instance, it will move around during the course of the quarter based upon the timing of particular revenues being booked, particularly expenses being booked. So that's why we're trying to focus you on the annual number.
Mike Nannizzi
Sticking on cash just for a second, the $0.13 to $0.17 for Gras Savoye, I am guessing that that number â that's a cash EPS number that's including the impact of debt that you might use to fund it, is that right?
John Greene
Yes that is correct.
Mike Nannizzi
Can we have the clean number from Gras Savoye then we can probably figure out what the debt piece is, but can you provide the gross number from Gras Savoye?
Dominic Casserley
We've given you the 2014 number, right, what the EBITDA number is for Gras Savoye in 2014 and we believe it is growing in 2015 as Tim outlined. By the time we get to the end of the year, we will have clarity on what it's grown to, but we've given you as best as we can see based upon the first quarter, it's been growing quite nicely.
John Greene
Just one of other point, Mike, if you do the financial statements filed in France by Gras Savoye to the regulator, you're going to see French GAAP numbers, so unless you're an expert in French GAAP to US GAAP, it will be pretty hard to do. So we tried to simplify that for you in the announcement of the transaction.
Mike Nannizzi
No problem. I'm sorry. I will follow up, I meant gross, S.S, not growth, I'll follow up with Peter afterwards. Thank you for that. And then just last one is still on cash, thinking about your cash coming in the door and then your cash going out the door for the next couple of years in terms of expenses and other items, do you expect that there maybe an opportunity to either reduce some of the debt that you plan to take out with Gras Savoye or return capital to shareholders in the form of reducing the share count net over the next 2 to 3 years?
Dominic Casserley
I think our overall capital strategy remains the same amount is to continue to, one, to invest organically where that involved CapEx, but obviously that's the systems appropriately, targeted M&A, committed to try and increase the dividend every year, which we've been doing and then finally trying to protect the share count from options exercises. We are going to take on more debt with Gras Savoye, as John said we see over the next couple of years despite that our debt to EBITDA number should come down as we grow, but we will continue to be broadly pursuing that policy of investing in the business and driving our dividend and immunizing our share count. John, do you want to add to that?
John Greene
The only thing I would add, Mike, is we have a fairly efficient balance sheet from an equity shareholder standpoint, given the leverage level. We are also investment grade and at this point it is certainly committed to maintaining that the rating. So what we're trying to do is in the context of low rate environment make sure we are making the best choices in terms of the capital structure of the balance sheet. So rate environment changes certainly our planning around the capital structure of the company will change. That's how I think about it.
Operator
We have one last question on queue and itâs from Mr. Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan
Two follow-ups. One on the buybacks. You did $15 million this quarter, does it mean you are still on track to fulfill the $175 million for the full year? And is there any limitation to do buybacks while you have acquisition pending?
Dominic Casserley
We are on track, so it just happened when we started the program, it's all we've done to date. We are still on track to do the program. We do have some limitations which we were given in terms of the price went through the roof on our stocks, so do you want to talk further about that, John?
John Greene
So the $175 million that we talked about in February, that's what we intend to do. That will offset the share creep as Dominic mentioned. We did put some threshold in terms of if the stock price goes over a certain level, then from a cash and capital management standpoint it becomes less â it makes less sense to accelerate buybacks or continue buyback. So if that were the case, the buybacks would taper off.
Kai Pan
Last question for Dominic, given the pending Miller and Gras Savoye, two big deal transaction, do you see it would take a pause in terms of large-scale acquisitions and how do you think about risk of going through a big operation restructuring program, while managing the two big integrations?
Dominic Casserley
It's a good question. Maybe take the two parts. First of all, let me be clear, our acquisition strategy is not let's go out and buy stuff. It's other interesting specialized franchises which we think would fit well with our organization and do we believe the people in those organizations want to be part of Willis and that's how we ended up sitting down some time ago thinking through which franchises were particularly interesting and which groups of people did we think would blend particularly well into Willis. And what you are seeing is the results of that work undertaken some time ago coming to fruition. And I do not have on the horizon obviously anything of the same scale that we're thinking about in terms of an acquisition.
Secondly in terms of the management of the business, the good news is that these are actually largely non-overlapping activities. So if you think of the Miller integration that obviously largely involves our management team in London. It is a largely London business and deeply ingrained into our London businesses and you know that we are moving some assets from some people from Miller to Willis and vice versa and that is deeply engaging those management teams.
Meanwhile the Gras Savoye acquisition involves a different management team. Again, in complementary businesses, in this case with hardly any overlap which makes the integration challenges relatively low and all the upside in terms of cross selling and going to plant together, all upside for people. So the reaction in turn is incredibly positive about the opportunities it creates internally within Gras Savoye and within Willis.
The operational improvement program cuts across elements of that, but not all elements and we are very much engaged in making sure that the management of that process does not get intertwined are upset by the acquisition activities. It sort of not involved in the Gras Savoye side at all and with Miller it's not really affecting the bits that are moving back and forth. So all in all, we are very comfortable of the way we are managing this.
Dominic Casserley
I think that was our last question, is that right? So Iâd like to thank everybody for coming and joining our call. Reiterate that weâre very excited about the growth potential and cash flow potential and shareholder value potential of the three parts of our strategy: organic growth, driving an organic margin development, driving value added M&A, and the impact overtime of our operational improvement program. And we look forward to talking to you again in July. Thank you very much indeed.
