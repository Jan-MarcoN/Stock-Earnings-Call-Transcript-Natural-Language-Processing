Dominic Casserley
Welcome and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO and Head of Willis Global; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.
By now youâve had a chance to read the news release that we put out last night, announcing our third quarter earnings. On this call John and I will give our prepared remarks and then weâll move to Q&A.
To begin, Iâd like to provide some comments on this quarterâs results, primarily on our organic commissions and fees growth and our underlying expense growth. Through the first half of 2014 we had grown our commissions and fees organically by 4.3%. This quarter growth for the group slowed to 2.5%, which is disappointing as it is below our first half result.
It is important, however, to get below this headline number to see that the decline is isolated in a few areas and that many of our regions and practices continue to growth well. For example, a theme you will hear across segments is weaker construction practice revenues this quarter. This is the result for timing of project and the fact that last yearâs quarter had some significant project revenues that have impacted the current comparison.
Looking at revenues, on a segment-by-segment basis, Willis International led the way contributing 6.3%. Willis North America added 3.4% and Willis Global, where most of the negative factors were play, came in very slightly down at 0.4%.
Now let me provide a little more detail of each of the segments internally. First, Willis International. Our international operations grew 6.3% in the quarter, bringing our organic growth rate year-to-date to 6.5%. Once again this is a really strong result from the segment. Latin America and Eastern Europe grew double-digit while Western Europe saw mid single-digit growth in the quarter. Asia was about flat as growth in China and Global Wealth Solutions was offset by a decline in Hong Kong.
Now, if you think about economic growth rates around the globe, it is clear that Willis Internationalâs organic growth has outpaced the nominal economic growth of many of the geographies in which it operates, that includes both Western Europe and many of the emerging markets. We believe that this is evidence of our strong market position in those international markets and our strategic initiatives to actively invest in the fastest growing market and take share in developed markets.
On to Willis North America, which continues to generate solid new business while maintaining strong retention levels. As I said, we delivered 3.4% organic growth in North America. We saw mid single-digit organic growth across several of our geographic regions with the Mid-West and Atlantic leading the way.
Rates in general in North America continue to moderate with of course variances across difference in lines of business. We recently published our market place realities report for those interested in deep dive into our view of 2015 rates in North America. It is available on our website.
Looking at our results by practice, importantly North Americaâs largest practice Human Capital grew mid single digits. Now while Iâm discussing human capital, let me provide a brief update on our healthcare exchange strategy which includes our own exchange offering The Willis Advantage.
I believe when we last updated you, we had 16 current and committed exchange plans in total. We now have 31 and that includes Willis in North America and the pipeline remains strong. More than 700 prospect in various stages of discussions. So we remain optimistic about the growth opportunity of this important business.
Our second largest practice in North America, construction, as I mentioned earlier, with down mid single digits in the quarter as a number of project in the prior year quarter did not recover. That is simply the nature of this project oriented business. Quarter-to-quarter results can be uneven. Importantly, year-to-date this practice is up mid single digits, so it continues to be a growing practice.
Now on to Willis Global, which is comprises the Willis Re, Willis Insurance UK, Facultative, Risk, and Willis Capital Markets and Advisory. Global to organic commissions and fees decreased by 0.4% in the quarter, this result reflected a blend of difference result across its major component businesses. Willis Re grew low single digits in a seasonally small quarter by continuing to innovatively server our plans and win new business. This was achieved against the backdrop or perhaps the most competitive market condition the reinsurance industry has been in more than a decade.
Within the reinsurance business, North America grew strongly supported by new business win and International grew modestly. However, the prevailing market conditions took their toll on the specialties reinsurance division which was down modestly in the quarter.
Moving onto Willis Insurance UK, which combines our UK retail unit and global specialty businesses. Willis Insurance UK declined mid-single digits in the quarter, which the majority of the weakness isolated in the specialty construction business which was also get a very difficult comparison due to large project revenues recorded in last yearâs quarter that did not recover. Meanwhile, natural resources saw strong growth and transportation grew low-single digit as aerospace saw some rate improvement. The UK retail business was up modestly year-over-year.
This business continues to be in turn around mode, but has been steadily improving. So, to conclude our revenues, as you can see the majority of our business continue to grow well in the quarter, but our overall growth rate of 2.5% was to pull down by some specific issues in the Specialty division of Willis Re and in selective specialty businesses.
With that, let me turn to expenses. I want to make a few brief observations about expenses. And then John will provide the appropriate level of details in his remarks. We told you last quarter, when we reported underlying expense grew of 6.1%, but we expected the rate of expense growth to decline at the second half of year. As the rate of increase in headcount slowed and our expense management initiatives to hold. In that context, our underlying expense growth in the current quarter was 4.1% an improvement relative to the first half of year.
Two points of importance I would like to make about our expense growth rate. First, to-date, we have received very little different benefit in our expenses from our operational improvement program. Therefore, we achieved this expense growth moderation through our expense management initiatives that we briefly discussed last quarter. Second, as we are achieving this moderation expense growth, we continue to invest in talent in the value added areas and in our higher growth markets to drive future growth.
So we are demonstrating progress in our expense growth rate, but to be clear, we obviously will not be pleased with any level of overall expense growth that exceeds our overall revenue growth. John will discuss the financial results of operations in greater detail. He will also provide an update on our operational improvement program, which is also a good start and we are pleased with the progress we are making. When he is finished I will come back to wrap up and discuss our inorganic growth before we turn to Q&A.
With that, Iâll hand it to John.
John Greene
Thank you, Dominic. I will be working up the third quarterâs slide deck posted on our website, starting at Slide 3. This is a walkthrough showing the major earnings component in terms of both recorded and underlying EPS. From the third quarter 2013, third quarter 2014, from 3Q 2013 recorded on the left hand side. We adjust for $0.34 related to the debt extinguishment charge to give us an underlying 3Q 2013 EPS of $0.19.
Moving across to slide, you can see increased commissions in fees for 3Q 2014 at $0.09 positive impact, an increased expenses at a $0.13 negative impact. The net of those items, a $0.04 reduction, represents the companyâs underlying business performance. Continuing across, you can see a net $0.01 negative impact from several items: higher quarter-over-quarter interest expense and a higher tax rate, partially offset by the results in our associate line and an increase from the non-controlling interest line.
The net impact of these gets us to third quarter underlying EPS of $0.14 per share. Let me remind you that we define underlying as reported excluding non-operating items and the impacts of foreign exchange movements. So, to get from underlying EPS to reported we have $0.10 of adverse movement in foreign currency and $0.08 of cost from the operational improvement program.
Drilling down into foreign exchange, we saw about $24 million of unfavorable movement. That breaks up as $3 million in commissions and fees and $7 million in operating expenses, which gives us a total of $10 million of foreign exchange translation impacts of $0.04 per share. Of that the most significant year-over-year currency movement for us was the relative strengthening of the pound against the dollar.
We also had $14 million or $0.06 per share of unfavorable foreign currency impacts to our other income line, which is below operating income. This was primarily a change in foreign currency gains and losses on revaluation of the non-functional currency assets and liabilities. The operational improvement charge in the quarter amounted to $17 million. You can find a breakdown of the charge by segment and expense category in the press release. I would note that weâve achieved savings of about $2 million in the program in the third quarter, primarily from headcount reductions.
Letâs turn to Slide 4, on underlying EBITDA and net cash flow from operations. You recall that we view underlying EBITDA as decent proxy for cash flow. You can see from this slide that underlying EBITDA was $636 million, down about $10 million year-to-date, which is a reduction of less than 2%.
Our net cash flows from operation over the first nine months of the year were down $85 million over the same period last year. The decrease was driven primarily by the non-recurrence of the close-out of derivative contracts in the third quarter last year, plus increased cash payment this year from our long-term incentive plans.
Slide 5 shows our reported and organic commission and fee growth by segments. I would add three things to what Dominic said. First, there was no impact on our International results from the China revenue recognition issue from the fourth quarter of last year. Second, overall reported growth in our International segment was lower than organic growth due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movement. This was partially offset by acquired revenues, primarily Charles Monat. And third, North Americaâs reported commission and fee growth was below organic growth because of the sale of some small slower growth businesses. We expect to close on the sale of a few more small offices in North America in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to the total expense block on Slide 6. From the left, we adjusted prior year reported balance for $7 million of adverse foreign currency movements experienced in the current quarter, and $1 million of fees related to the debt extinguishment cost that we incurred within other operating expense during the third quarter last year. As a side note, we also paid $65 million tender premium related to the refi, but that flowed through interest expense on the net basis of last yearâs result.
So that gets us to an underlying amount of $731 million of total expenses in last yearâs quarter. Moving across underlying expenses grew by $30 million or 4.1%. Salaries and benefits accounted for $22 million of the growth; other operating expense is $7, and the last million from depreciation and amortization. That gets you to $761 million of total underlying operating expenses in the current quarter. When youâre adding the $17 million charge related to the operational improvement program, you get to the reported total expense of $778 million for 3Q 2014.
Slide 7 provides more details on salaries and benefits. So the primary driver of salary and benefit expense grows over the past several quarters has been our investment in new talent. We told you last quarter that the growth in our salary and benefit line item would decline over the remainder of the year, as a result of the slow down in net headcount additions in 2014. In the second quarter of 2014, S&B increased 6.3% year-over-year. This quarter the rate of growth declined 4%. FTEs were up 2% since September 2013, so we increased headcount accounted for about half of the S&B growth. The remainder was largely due to salary increases, which were essentially in line with inflation.
Headcount growth through the first nine month of 2014 was 1.7%, more than half of the growth is in our low cost operations in Mumbai. To be clear, the increase is not part of our operational improvement program, but rather part of them moved from low cost operations that we have been implementing before we announced the program. As we have said, the program in large part involves the significant acceleration of movements already well underway for many years, building on the skills and experience we have developed over those years.
Turning to Slide 8, let me give you input on some of the non-operating items. Other income and expenses, which is below operating income includes the revaluation foreign currency loss. This is a $14 million year-over-year change, the primary currency drivers of this change were movements in the Venezuelan bolivar, the euro and the pound sterling against the U.S dollar.
Taxes in the quarter were impacted by a $4 million adjustment reflecting an increased proportion of U.S earnings relative to the U.K, as you know the U.S corporate tax rate is almost double that of the UK. Our associate line showed improvement in the quarter driven by Gras Savoye.
Letâs turn to the balance sheet and uses of cash at slide 9. As you can see, we ended the third quarter with $656 million of cash, up over $30 million a year ago. The decreased cash balance relative to year-end was driven primarily by the share buyback program and increased cash dividend. This was partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of the third quarter 2013 tender premium paid on our debt refinancing.
Regarding our uses of cash, I would highlight that we repurchased almost 2 million shares of stock for about $82 million during the quarter. Earlier this month, we completed our announced buyback program having repurchased little over 5 million shares in total at a cost of about $213 million. CapEx is up a little due to investments in systems and infrastructures, dividends are 9% higher and we have been more active in M&A, including the Charles Monat acquisition that closed in the second quarter.
Letâs turn to slide 10, to update on the operational improvement program we promised back in April. Youâve read in our press release that we have updated our estimated savings based on the actions we are taking in 2014 or will take in 2015. Weâve also provided saving of our projected spend.
Starting with the updated saving, we are now estimating that we will achieve saving at least $8 million on actions weâve taken in 2014 thatâs $3 million ahead of our original estimate. The majority of the saving flowing for this year are from headcount reduction, primarily in our UK operation.
For 2015, we are now estimating at least $60 million of in-year savings thatâs $50 million ahead of the original estimate. Our 2014 and 2015 actions will result in an estimated $120 million of annualized savings by the end of the program that is 40% of our $300 million estimated total annual saving. We still expect program cost savings of $135 million in 2016 and $235 million in 2017 as unchanged from our original estimates.
Turning to the cost side, we expect to spend about $40 million in 2014 some of that of course the (inaudible) work and we expect to spend about a $130 million in 2015 that gives us about $170 million of the total $410 we anticipate on spending over the life of the program, the remaining $240 million will be spent in 2016 and 2017. Let me note that the spend (inaudible) as weâve defined the term here, this total operational improvement program related things for items it will flow directly through our income statements or through items that are capitalized and run through depreciation over the time, so itâs a combination of expense and CapEx.
Weâve made a good start to the program, to help you track our progress, weâll provide you with three metrics indexed to margin this year, they are the ratio of FTEs in higher cost geographies to lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers which stood at ratio of 80% / 20%, plus the square footage of real estate per FTEs and desks per FTEs both indexed to 100, we believe these metrics will be helpful to you in measuring our progress on middle office and back office transitions and real estate efficient.
With that, Iâll hand it back over to Dominic.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you, John. Iâd like to conclude with an update on our M&A activity. Last quarter we told you about the investment weâve made in our Human Capital and Benefits capabilities in the Nordics. Specifically, our acquisition of a controlling stake Max Matthiessen in Sweden, that transaction closed earlier this month and weâre delighted to work in the Max Matthiessen team to our worldwide Human Capital and Benefits practice.
Additionally, weâre pleased to have announced the acquisition of SurePoint Reinsurance Advisors that will meaningfully expand our capabilities in the Accident & Health to insurance market in North America. And we also acquired a range of Irish Pension and Financial Advisory businesses from IFG which nicely compliment our global Human Capital and Benefits Practice. Finally weâve announced last week that Willis is an advanced exclusive talk with Miller Insurance Services LLP to take a majority interest in that leading independent specialist program, under the proposed transaction we would combine also businesses to trade under the Miller brand when we are able to we will update you on the progress of these discussions.
Let me leave you with these thoughts about three plans of our strategies. First, Iâm convinced that our strategy to grow revenues organically through our global present by connecting Willis together to deliver better solution for our clients and through innovation. Weâll continue to drive new business and increase our share of wallet from existing client despite some isolated negative items this quarter, we exhibited good organic growth in most of the business.
Second, our measured acquisition strategy that is focused on high quality, specialized firms with leading market position, is proceeding well. We believe this strategy will further increase our growth rate and support our organic positioning.
Third, you are starting to see the results of our disciplined approach to control expense growth and the early encouraging actions from our Operational Improvement Program. Together, these three items of organic growth focused, M&A and expense management give all us at Willis great confidents that we are heading in the right direction to achieve earnings growth, margin expansion and improved cash flow.
With that operator may we please begin with the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes sir, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant of Nomura. Sir, your line is open.
Cliff Gallant â Nomura Holdings Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for your comments about the organic growth flowing in the quarter. And I wanted to just to clarify the â what is the outlook for Willis Insurance in the UK in the fourth quarter, should we continue to expect a little underperformance there offsetting the areas, is that right?
Dominic Casserley
Well let me handle it, I have obviously Steve Hearn who overseas with this Insurance UK, which part of global. Obviously with the plays as you know we donât provide quarter-to-quarter lendings revenue or cost specific guidance. But with that let me have Steve just give a sense of how weâre doing?
Steve Hearn
Thanks Dominic. Thanks for the question. And I remind you of course, but our UK Insurance business is a sum of its parts. So we have some, as we pointed out in the script, some business that have performed well in Q3 and in fact performed well throughout the year for us. And some business that continue to drive significant growth for the organization, we have some challenges to it, UK retail has been a challenge for us for a period of time. Some years and not something that Iâve been working on very hard over the quarter this year in terms of a turnaround program for our UK retails business.
And letâs say, we continue to drive strong growth in many parts of the organization. Within as well as our global specialty operations which continue to be market leading businesses and weâre very proud of our position as market leader, with some strong margin contribution and profit from those in those businesses. Iâm afraid I canât get to the specifics as Dominic said of giving some guidance around what will happen in Q4.
Cliff Gallant â Nomura Holdings Inc.
Okay. As a follow-up on the U.S. construction, you discussed how the year-to-date number was up mid-single digit. And I just want to clarify thatâs what you see at the trend not the decline you saw in the third quarter.
John Greene
Well Iâm going to hand over to Todd to talk, Todd Jones to talk about U.S. construction, but clearly I think we try to indicate to you that weâre obviously looking when we think about our revenues generically, looking at how theyâve been performing during the course of the year as much as what happened in this particular quarter, but Todd why donât you talk about construction in the U.S?
Todd Jones
Yes I think, Dominic said it well, that if you look at how the businesses performed sort of quarter-over-quarter and then year-to-date, obviously our Q2 performance which was sort of mid-teens was a bit of an outlier in terms growth. And the expectation is the business continues to perform well, we continue to see a tremendous amount of activity on both the projects sates and the surety side and our expectations is, weâre going to continue to perform in that states as we had year-to-date.
Cliff Gallant â Nomura Holdings Inc.

Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of (inaudible). Sir your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. I realized the third quarter is seasonally a light quarter for revenue, but weâre just trying to get a hand on when we might see some stabilization that just with pretax margin. I know third quarter may not be the best indicator of that, but as earnings estimate keep coming down, I think that will be a headwind on the start, so any insight you can help us with that will be helpful in this. Thanks?
John Greene
Well, again I canât give you, Iâm not going to give you specific guidance, but obviously the thing which you have to analyze is the sense of revenue momentum on ongoing basis versus where we see cost momentum. And I think youâre trying to see the cost momentum, cost growth come down, so free the Operational Improvement Program, which hasnât really kicked in yet and we will see an acceleration of the of the impact of the Operational Improvement Program.
So obviously our plan is to continue to have strong organic growth, to supplement that with M&A growth and to see the combination of normal expense management, which you started to see the impact of, combined with the Operational Improvement Program, to see the crossover into and the increase in margin expansion. And those were points I made at the end of my remarks. And we can see all the ingredients for that happen.
Unidentified Analyst
Thatâs helpful. Do you think that crossover point, do you think that 2015 or 2016?
John Greene
Yes, okay. I hope itâs as soon as we can possibly make it. The â you could after analyze what youâd see the numbers going through, in terms of our revenue momentum and the deceleration of our organic expense growth. And how thatâs going to play out and John took you through for instance the trend lines in our salary and benefits over the last few quarters. And you can see that itâs actually been flat, and the impact of the Operational Improvement Program.
So we would obviously expect those trends continued that we will be able to see performance improving in good time.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then on a separate topic would be potential use of free cash for the Miller deal. What impact, if any, does that have on the potential acquisition of the remainder of Gras Savoye in 2015?
John Greene
Very good question. We remain very confident of our ability to fund both in Miller transaction and Gras Savoye through our normal cash flow on hand, and that capacity.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is open.
Michael Nannizzi â Goldman Sachs

Thank you. See the one slide on the OEP on the Operational Expense Program, you talked about savings been better than the April announcement or at least a trajectory of them. Is there any difference to the costs that you outlined or that you expected when you originally outlined the plan versus now? In other words, are you investing more now than you anticipated back in April? Thanks.
John Greene
We didnât give you the details back then, if you remember, how you expected to face our expense growth. I mean I think you can.

Michael Nannizzi â Goldman Sachs

Yes, I know.
John Greene
Expect, you can naturally expect that in our ability to accelerate saving. Of course that doesnât mean youâre going to see some slight acceleration of expenses. Because that is too far water in the expenses, parallel running costs. Some redundancy costs in the specific system investments you might make to simplify a process. And obviously building out of capability to absorb more people in lower cost locations, you got to have somewhere for them to sit, for instance.
So, obviously as we have accelerated our expectation of where our savings will come, we obviously would incur for obvious reasons, cost a bit earlier.
Michael Nannizzi â Goldman Sachs

Got it, okay. And then I am just curious itâs just going a little bit deeper operationally. What sort of actions are you taking to make sure that program doesnât negatively impact morale in the areas that you are looking to retain folks?
John Greene
Very good question and so all the leaders of this program, all the people are having involved in it are focussed on a number of metrics. Obviously, a critical issue about self-morale is actually how is this affecting client service? And so as we advance every single project we are also measuring client service metrics to make sure that, as we make changes, not only our clients but inform to understand what we are doing. But of course at the end of the day, we actually want client service metrics to go up. So we are first of all, very firmly focussing on client service as much as operational improvement as we or cost improvement as we do this.
Secondly, should understand this s a program which is highly involving everybody, who is doing the change. These programs are not from some outside element doing the change, these are Willis driven programs, with people heavily involved in the operational improvements. As of that is the â the process we are going through.
Michael Nannizzi â Goldman Sachs
Got it and then just on that â I mean, have you also incorporated into your sort of expectation, when you talk abut declining year-over-year increase and expenses, any potential for â higher retention costs or to the extent that becomes a tool that you utilize to manage retention or is that just not something do you anticipate of being an issue. Thanks?
Dominic Casserley
Well, we have two â obviously in the cost of the program include, first of all parallel running, right so, we have to run. Letâs say we have a new process taking place in Mumbai, which was taking place in a city, in a developed market. We are going to run those two processes in parallel for a period of time to make sure that (inaudible) client services in place et cetera.
And then, secondly, we obviously watch very carefully the â we are making sure that we can retain key people during that process. As you would expect we have normal approach to retention payments et cetera as necessary to make sure that key people while weâre are making that transition are intended to stay.
John Greene
Dom, I think if I could add, in the (inaudible) there was a specific launch for retention works.
Michael Nannizzi â Goldman Sachs
Okay, and got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, the next question comes from the line Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open.
Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
Good morning everyone. You know â first question is for John. Trying to understand slide three the EPS growth, when we are in the third quarter of 2015, going forward from this quarter into that earnings quarter. What is the underlying EPS number you start with? Is it $0.06, is it $0.14? Iâm trying to understand thereâs no foreign currency moving between 3Q, 2013 and 3Q, 2014. How does that comparable when 3Q, 2014 becomes history, what will the EPS number be recorded as, as it relate to 3Q, 2015 earnings?
Dominic Casserley

So the way we do this is we take the actual results in the prior year as effectively rebased for the currency that weâre seeing. Thatâs different between the current year and those offside their rebase, will be a FX adjustment reflected on the earnings block on Page 3.
Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
So, 2015 looking back on 3Q 2014, the EPS number will be $0.06 per share, the underlying EPS number will be $0.06 per share?
Dominic Casserley

No, no. It will depend on what actually happens to the rates in the period.
Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
The historical number, not the new number? There will be no currency rates at that point like at â currency, it was $0.06 per share and that will be the basis for which you measure performance in 3Q 2015?
Dominic Casserley

Yes. So what itâll do is that foreign currency movement effectively rebases to the prior year and then youâre on a constant currency throughout the lock from one period to the next. If you like, weâre happy to take this off-line and what you through the exact mechanics, but itâs your standard constant currency analysis.

Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
Okay. I guess Iâm just trying to rate my model with EPS over your quarters recorded for post air but the other question, last quarter question whether or not margins hit bottom and the answer was probably not with the end of 2014. We think your answer to Jayâs question, I guess margins going bottom is doing as they can, but maybe youâre taking a timeline away.
Dominic Casserley

No. Iâm never going to give a very, very specific timing on any particular quarterâs revenue or cost performance in advance for the reason to be that we have time. I think you just have to look, as I said, in answer to the question earlier is that the trend line in our revenues in this year and what you see based upon our expense actions prior to the Operational Improvement Program, and we given you a lot of information on that in terms of how itâs decelerating and whatâs happening to S&B cost quarter-to-quarter, and how that therefore is trending, and how we see the Operational Improvement Program flowing through.
And we are very confident that we are doing all the right things to have those lines crossed and weâve been very kale, we will not be happy until weâre regularly producing revenue growth which is more than cost growth. We think we are taking all the right actions to have that crossover happen as soon as possible.
Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
That makes perfect sense. Is the business is in good of a shape today as you thought it would be one year ago?
Dominic Casserley
No, I think in many ways itâs in even better shape. Let me go through the elements of that. The fundamental drivers of organic growth of our strategy which is in the round connecting Willis together so that we can deliver around the world our specialty capabilities through our multiple channels to our clients. In a coordinated way itâs well advanced. Weâve made great strides in that, we are seeing good momentum in new business wins, pipelines are strong, we are very happy with the way that developing.
Expense growth management, we deliberately made investments for that strategy I just described to you in the second half of 2013. We knew that was going to be pig in the python problem in terms of cost comparisons during 2014 and we said that you. We said that, we thought we were to expense growth declined during the quarter 2014 as we implemented expense management activity post that investment and you are seeing that take place and we are confident about that.
We also, meanwhile, continue to be also investing the talent to drive that organic revenue growth, so weâre confident about that. The operational improvement program which we only announced in April is ahead of where we thought it would be and is getting traction and we arc confident to deliver ahead of the schedule we laid out in April.
And finally, we very, very explicitly laid out a M&A strategy focused on specialty situations which had strong franchises, high quality terms that we would not be going after just volume just bulking up, but instead weâd be going after very specific transactions where we could engage in exclusive conversations to bring those very talented organization as part of the Willis family. We are very pleased on the progress we made on that and are highly excited about how itâs going to play through in 2015. So actually, if you ask how do I feel about the health of Willis now compared to a year ago, I feel very good.
Josh Shanker â Deutsche Bank
Thank you for the answers and good luck in 2015.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your line is open.
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Hi good morning. Part of the organic growth appears that a lot of the slowdown this quarter was sort of because of one time issues, because of the construction practice, is my understanding of that correct?
Dominic Casserley
Yes, well weâve highlighted that, if you look at the detail behind the headline of 2.5% organic growth. You can see that North America continued to grow little, the trend line has been on International growth again of over 6%; and so we had some very various specific issues, number of them coincidentally in construction. So, your interpretation is correct.

Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Iâm just looking over to the fourth quarter, do we have any sort of bad comps fourth quarter this year versus fourth quarter last year?
Dominic Casserley
Well as we said to you last year, we did have again a very strong construction quarter in the fourth quarter of 2013. So that will just be a tough com. But again, we remained optimistic about the trend line in the majority of our businesses.
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Sure. And then upon the expense savings, I believe that itâs about 8 million of expense savings on the operational driven program, has that already flowed through earnings this year or do you expect that in the fourth quarter?
Dominic Casserley
No, I think we made out that we had a very-very small number in the third quarter. So, the majority of that number will obviously flow into the fourth quarter.
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Okay, and the $60 million for next year, how much do you expect to flow down to the bottom-line and how much do you expect to reinvest in the business?
Dominic Casserley
Well, we said overall, but I think the majority of the savings we have will flow to the bottom-line. I think the way to think about this is the different component parts that drive our expenses. And let me hand over to John, to help you think about that.
John Greene
Thank you, Dominic. So if you think about our cost base, itâs a subject to inflation, somewhere between 2% to 3% based on the geographic mix. So that naturally wants to increase the expense base. We have the operational improvement program, the savings that weâre talking about here, coming through as an offset to some of that inflation. And then there will be select investments that continue to be able to drive positive operating margin growth and weâre going to do that, but weâre going to do that but weâre going to be very specific in making sure that we get definitive paybacks on that, so you can do the math based on what I just described there.
So really good progress in the operational improvement program, inflation 2% to 3% is what weâre seeing based on the geographic mix, and selective investments we said that the majority of the operational improvement program would saw through.
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Sure. And one last question and I apologize for the many questions, but on the other expense line I believe you said $14 million of that was for the foreign exchange, but the reported number was $9 million. Whatâs the difference between the two?
John Greene
So the $14 million is revaluation FX and there was a translation FX of about $10 million, so there is a difference between the two. The revaluation FX basically takes a look at non-monitory aspects and liabilities and it takes the year-over-year change in the FX rate doesnât reval and that creates a P&L debit or credit charge or income. So this quarter what we saw when we compared to third quarter 2013, we saw weakening of the Europe, Venezuela, and Boulevard and the pound sterling versus third quarter 2013 where we saw strengthening in the Euro and the pound as you will recall. So that difference created a year-over-year P&L charge of $14 million that we talked about in my script.
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Thank you.
John Greene
Is it helpful?
Vinay Misquith â Evercore Partners
Yes, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kai Pan â Morgan Stanley
Thank you and good morning. First a quick question on the restructuring cost and thank you for the breakdown, but you mentioned already about the total costs 70% probably attributable to people and 30% to system. Is that same proportional throughout the years for your restructuring cost?
Dominic Casserley
Broadly, yes.
Kai Pan â Morgan Stanley
Okay. And then secondly on the margin question, if you were thinking about because of economic slowing down whatever marketable issues that your organic growth staying at like, letâs say 2% to 3%-ish range. Well, the cost â the operational improvement program enough for the savings to drive some margin expansion there or itâs difficult even with the ongoing improvements in operations?
Dominic Casserley
So I think we tried to be very clear and clarify this issue of what the impact of the operational improvement program as it plays through. If we were to see organic growth rates, normal organic growth rates of the business â the numbers you see, so that the equivalent of over 4% we see in year-to-date. If we were to see that number at the lower end of our single-digit range sort of much lower than that 4% number, the operational improvement program, we believe, underpinned our ability to achieve our margin expansion number. If we see more robust growth at the middle or higher end of our mid single-digit, obviously the operational improvement program enables us to expand margin over time more than that 70 basis points. Thatâs the explanation weâve given and thatâs how we see it.
Kai Pan â Morgan Stanley
Okay, thatâs great. Then lastly, Iâm just curious about your thought about capital management priorities. So especially between â now youâve been very focused on some of the focused acquisition just versus like share buybacks. I just wonder what you saw behind, doing acquisitions or return to shareholders?
Dominic Casserley
No, I think our position remains where it has been. We continue to focus on our capital management as followed. Obviously, we have to fund CapEx et cetera as we drive the business. Next, we want to be able to grow our dividend as our earnings grow. Third, we want to immunize the balance sheet on the number of share count for our option exercises â employee option exercises. We did that in 2014 with the program we announced. And then, we had M&A. And thatâs how we are thinking about our program and obviously managing accordingly.
Kai Pan â Morgan Stanley
So, actually the buybacks are just to neutralize the share creation actually ahead of acquisition. So it seems youâll finish your program $200 million, so is there going to be another one just outside ongoing the issuance?
Dominic Casserley
We will examine whatâs happening to the option exercises this year and look whatâs happening in the outlook and make an announcement accordingly.
Kai Pan â Morgan Stanley
Thank you so much for the answers.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Sir, your line is open.
Robert Glasspiegel â Janney Capital
Good afternoon. Well, I got some numbers question, I apologize. But Dominic, if you go back to your sort of original plan â five-year plan to grow revenues 70 bps faster than the expenses, the math works out to about 250 basis point margin improvement from a 21.6 base of 2012. You lost the 160 bps of ground last year and youâre 100 bps behind for this year, so that puts you 260 bps behind which gives you 500 bps to get in the next three plus years. The optimist in me says that, well they have been updated that plan Dominic must still have confidence that itâs achievable.
The realist in me says that with the economic impairment, little less good than we thought it might be a couple of years ago and currency, a little bit in your phase and rates slowing, to try to get 500 bps of margin improvement in three plus years seems like itâs is a formidable task. Who is right the optimist or the realist?
John Greene
Weâll see, itâs overwhelming, wonât we?
Dominic Casserley
Iâm obviously not going to answer that question, I kind of going go back to what I said earlier right. Which is that we have a very strong Operational Improvement Program we put place, which can deliver very significant cost benefits. Youâre right to say, that our befits to drive our margin expansion and most important youâve all the number as you know. You and I talked about a number of times that Iâm really focused on, which is cash flow generation, right. Thatâs the real number, which we will be focused on. Our ability to that is obviously dependent, as well on well revenues grow, which to some degree is impacted by the economic outcome.
I would, reiterate what I said earlier today, which is, Iâm pleased do not drive a direct correlation between economic performance on global economy and our ability to grow organic revenues. There is some correlation, of course. Of course there is.
But we have shown, I think, quite successfully over for long period of time. That in a number our markets, we are able to outgrowth nominal GDP, because either weâre taking shift or because actually the underlying growth of brokerage of property and casualty insurance or healthcare in commercial state is growing much faster than the underlying economy. So yes of course were affected by economic outlook, but itâs not a one-to-one type ratio.
Robert Glasspiegel â Janney Capital
Well did you take service that you havenât adjusted your 2013 plan. So to me that those can be a confidence that you think youâre on track. So just another question and, how does your incentive comp plan tied to your results, your cash payments were higher this year than before because of I assume history not anything related to this year, next year results. But if margins arenât expanding, is there a question and maybe that number sort of declining perspectively?
Dominic Casserley
Yes, youâre right, perfectly youâre right that â to what we referred to this year, we referred to an old plan. I mean you should be very confident and itâs all available with that. The two key drivers of incentive compensation which is our annual bonus plan and our long-term incentive plan are directly tied to the performance of revenue growth and EBITDA growth in the annual plan, and on the long-term plan, multi-year revenue growth and EBIT growth overtime. And so, yes, you are right. Our incentive programs are absolutely aligned with the things that drive cash flow generation.
Robert Glasspiegel â Janney Capital
Is there a potential positive in Q4 as you true-up or do you, has that been trued up to the year when youâre accounting?
Dominic Casserley
We true up as best we can as we go, okay.
Robert Glasspiegel â Janney Capital
So donât look for that as a potential headwind and tailwind in the fourth quarter is your answer?
Dominic Casserley
No, I wouldnât do that. We try and to our best to true up as we go.
Robert Glasspiegel â Janney Capital
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Thomas Mitchell of Miller Tabak. Sir, your line is open.
Thomas Mitchell â Miller Tabak

Iâm a little bit curious. I understand that the Venezuelan Bolivar may not be very hedgeable but it would seem that your other currency exposures are hedgeable, is it just terribly expensive to go into the market and hedge for currencies or have you just generally decided to live with the ups and downs?
Steve Hearn
Yes, so a good question. So weâve actually spent some time looking at it, so there is the translation that which is running through the P&L so revenue and expense, not the other income or expense line. That piece has to do with the structural mismatch in the U.K. in terms of 60% of the revenue comes-in in dollars, the cost base is sterling. So weâve looked at that and itâs impossible to get a cost effective hedge that would also hedge the movements in the currencies. It is just really, really hard thing to do. Weâve talked to a number of bankers who had some ideas about it, but nothing that we viewed is something that we could implement.
In terms of the revaluation FX, our program there is basically â what we try to do is ensure that functional currency cost and functional currency revenue are matched and thereby having a natural, natural hedge. And if there is a change in the underlying FX rate period-over-period, we gain that largely the non-cash so we havenât gone through to try to hedge that. And thatâs one of the reasons why we broken out the underlying way weâve done that.
Thomas Mitchell â Miller Tabak
Right, and okay that helps very much. Thank you. The other question I have is a little bit more conceptual. I mean itâs about something that we all sort of think we understand, but the construction business has stops and starts sensitive to different things. Itâs probably different in the UK than it is in the U.S. but in general, there must be some sort of leading indicators that you have to give you an idea of whether projects are going to be started or theyâre going to be delayed and how big they are and how much coverage they need to win? What is sort of the timing of this sort of thing? You have to wait until somebody breaks ground to assume that you now have a coverage initiated?
Timothy D. Wright

So, Iâm going to ask Steve talk about that. I think it is worth of course remembering that within construction, there are sort of lower ticket items going through on an ongoing basis and of course then these big projects right which can affect the quarter-to-quarter numbers. Do you want to talk more about the latter, Steve?
Steve Hearn
Yes, I mean you are absolutely right Tom. It is very much close and to your question or in your question which is, there are difference between UK and North America impact, the coverage is different and in fact the market is to provide the capacity are often different as well.
I should say as well construction for us is strength, itâs been an issue for us as we called in terms of some specifics around Q3 but we are a significant leader both in the UK and in North America in terms of construction business and for both of those activities in fact around the world from our UK business. Obviously, itâs the large and profitable activity for us.
But as Dominic described, itâs made up of lots of different things that the continual pipeline of smaller projects which we have significant shareholder and continue to come through very effectively for us. It is typically the larger projects that drive the lumpiness that you see in our performance both positively and negatively. The lead time can be significant on, I mentioned in some cases, fast projects on billions of dollars of deal every initial asset value in some cases and those are very complex in terms the way they finance, very complex in terms of the way they tended often multiple suppliers involved and often multiple brokers engaged in terms of providing the coverage and the voice around us.
And again, buried in your question, if youâll excuse the pump, it is literally when the shovel spade goes into the ground that we know we have contract in place that show a risk on many of these projects. Youâre right.
Thomas Mitchell â Miller Tabak

Well, thank you very much. Itâs very clear.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Sir, your is open.
Meyer Shields â Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you, good morning. If I can keep beating on the construction issue, are there seasonal quarters where construction is a bigger or smaller portion of your project?
Dominic Casserley

I believe also that is no. Again, as I said, because these are very significant contracts and we are particularly strong in that area, it really is about when a contract is awarded and construction begins and that dealt and tie around unlike other parts of the insurance where theyâll tie around sort of traditional renewal date, sort of seasonal renewal dates. When you see other parts of our business, itâs when the contract is awarded. The more run at the middle business maybe youâd see most funded business as usually if you like. You maybe see an element of that, but no, itâs not skewed certainly in the UK and international world and I believe thatâs the case in North America as well.
Meyer Shields â Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Okay, thatâs helpful. I think I have a question for Dominic, Iâm not sure. You had an impressive slowdown inorganic expense growth from 1.4 to 1.0. When we consider the variable expenses associated with some of the business though if organic revenue growth would have been a 4.5% range. Could you give us a sense of what organic expense growth would have been?
Dominic Casserley
Iâll first cut it there. That is not the driver here. We might have had slightly more incentive compensation, so profits would have been better. But itâs not â I think the thing thatâs very important, we do not believe that the slow down in our revenue growth is because weâve been slowing expense growth, right. We highlighted we use specific teams that got on specific businesses, and meanwhile International has been growing over 6%, North America is growing over 3% et cetera. We might have â as I said had some got a better performance. To the earlier question we had about accruing bonuses we might had slightly higher bonus accrual, John do you want to add?
John Greene
Yes, the only thing I would add is when we look at the second quarter, the year-over-year quarter-over-quarter headcount change was about a increase of 4% in the second quarter 2014 versus second quarter 2013.
So that we put on some inflation on there and itâs â it gets you up to that 6 plus percent number we talked about. In the September results, what weâre seeing is that headcount increase versus September last year of only 2%, so that really explains the delta in the cost.
Dominic Casserley

Yes, yes.

Meyer Shields â Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So the increase and I appreciate what you were saying about the incentive compensation, I was just asking more about sort of fundamental producer compensation that wouldnât have been (inaudible) different.
Dominic Casserley
Same, same.
Meyer Shields â Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Okay.

Dominic Casserley
No. And in fact the North American producer compensation because we had, weâve got actually good quarter in North America running above the normal levels.
Meyer Shields â Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great, thatâs very helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Sir, your line is open.

Brian Meredith â UBS
Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick question, first, I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more in free cash flow. I was wondering, if you could talk about what was the actual dollar figure of the non-recurring and derivative to close out last year versus this year. So, if we can just get a better kind of run rate of what free cash flow kind of looks like right now? Or is it the right thing what I can think about? And is there anything else going on there? And then lastly, pension any updated thoughts on what pension contributions look like next year?
Dominic Casserley
Okay. Yes, Iâll be happy to take that. So, there were three hedging activities that ended out coming through and creating a year-over-year difference. So, there was a treasury lock last year 2013 that through about $20 million ended at P&L. There was an interest rate swap in 2013 that was about $15 million dollars of cash. And then, in the current year, related to the Max Matthiessen acquisition, there was another swap that ended up creating about a $15 million delta negative to cash.
So, you sum those up and you got about $50 million quarter-over-quarter issue. We also had in the quarter some working capital changes. It seems a significant portion of that, the working capital fees had to do with the reclassification of some businesses to assets held for sale which is other assets, which the amortization â the goodwill and intangibles where long-term assets will move up to short-term.
So that creates a working capital, that could increase the drives of cash flow number at least in terms of what you are looking at. Itâs really not a cash item, matter of fact the exit of the business will create some positive cash flow for the fourth quarter.
Brian Meredith â UBS
Pension.
Dominic Casserley
Pension. Yes, so thank you, Dominic. In terms of pension year-to-date we are under prior year. So, weâve contributed about $25 million this year and versus $48 million in the third quarter last year. What we expect for the year is year-over-year pension contributions will probably be down about $20 million.
Brian Meredith â UBS
Year-over-year, okay. And any thoughts on 2015 at this point.
Dominic Casserley
No. Not at that this point.
Brian Meredith â UBS
Okay. And then, just one last one here, Iâm just curious, I know you canât give any details with respect to Millers as far as the financial implications and stuff like that. But what about your strategic rationale behind the trend action, I wanted to give a little bit, why?
Dominic Casserley
Now, Iâm going to turn to Steve, because obviously the facts particularly our London business is our position in our market.
Steve Hearn

Sure. I am going to keep it straight not to get into any detail in terms of different action itself. Itâs a difficult question to answer without doing that. Millers I think people would recognize and be preeminent independent wholesaler in the London market, a Company thatâs operating for over a 100 years under the Miller brand with a very slow wholesale content and as we declared on the amounts that we have an exclusive conversation around this acquisition with also some businesses that we move into Willis, and that the treaty reinsurance business by its own.
We have strong credential in wholesale business Willis and overall history in wholesale. In fact if you track back only a couple of decades ago, Willis was fundamentally a wholesale group of itself until that time when itâs set up its retail capability international and in North America. Until this day, we have significant wholesale capability within our existing London operations.
We felt strategically that it might sense particularly given the connecting Willis strategy, itâs deepening our connections across the organization around the world. we recognized the different around wholesale and this provides the fantastic vehicles, if I would conclude this, it will allow us to operate in fact in those markets. a connected Willis organization times the strength of our specialty businesses and the London market wholesale operations.
Brian Meredith â UBS
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. No question at this time. (Operator Instructions)
Peter Poillon

All right. Given that there are no more questions on the line, we just close that you have, because it would be on time. Iâll just put some few closing remarks. First of all, let me reiterate, there have currently been several unusual events this quarter and of course, itâs that side, it is the compass reinsurance market for example, for over a decade.
We feel we are making progress in our efforts on expense management at this quarterâs outcome insurance growth illustrates weâre really encouraged by the results weâre seeing in the operational improvement program and what we can see that will achieve in 2015.
So we have a long way to go on this, but so far so good, and we wonât be distracted from our goals that weâve laid out. looking further out, of course, economic growth in many major markets as everyone comments that people evolved from this quarter remains uneven. So we of course, are really cautious, but our revenue performance year-to-date underscores the value of related business model and the power of our portfolio and our components in the future. Thanks very much.
