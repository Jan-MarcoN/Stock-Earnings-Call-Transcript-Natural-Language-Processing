On behalf of Quintiles, good morning and welcome to the Quintiles Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Janine and I will be your web event specialist today. As a reminder, today's event is being recorded. At the end of today's presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session.
It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Todd Kasper, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kasper, the floor is yours.
Todd Kasper - Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Janine. Good morning and welcome to Quintiles third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 12, 2015.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would like to point out that, as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange. And, therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Now, let's begin on slide three with some highlights. I'm pleased to report another quarter that included improved margins contributing to strong growth in diluted adjusted earnings per share.
Revenue growth improved in Product Development and moderated in IHS, as expected. Product Development had a solid book-to-bill with a great mix of work. We completed the Q2 Solutions joint venture in July. And our leadership team is off to a very good start there with a positive reception from our customers. Our team worked hard and delivered solid earnings and cash flow this quarter.
The strong EPS reflects our focused approach to managing the business. We received a number of awards in the quarter which reflect our strong performance and industry leadership position. We also deepened our management bench strength. Finally, in addition to these topics, I will discuss the environment we see later in the call.
Moving on to the top-line on the numbers. We recorded $1.16 billion of net new business in the quarter which translates to an overall 1.06 book-to-bill ratio, including a 1.2 book-to-bill ratio in the Product Development segment. The overall book-to-bill included a large cancellation in our North America commercial business late in the quarter. We have a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.27 across the business and 1.36 in Product Development.
Our service revenues grew by 8.3% at constant currency with a stronger contribution from the Product Development segment, including contribution from Q2 Solutions and the expected lower growth in the IHS segment compared to the strong growth rates in the first half of the year.
With the strength of new business wins in Product Development in recent quarters, we're continuing to see an increase in the number of studies in the start-up and early phases of recruitment. The overall adjusted income from operations margin grew to 16.4% compared to 14.2% in the prior year quarter with the growth largely coming from improved constant currency margins and IHS as well as foreign exchange benefits in Product Development.
In the third quarter, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 44.6% compared to the same quarter last year to $0.94 per share. Our strong year-to-date operating performance produced $212.7 million of free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, an increase of $94.7 million compared with the same nine-month period last year. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value through both organic and inorganic investments as well as returning value to shareholders through share repurchases.
Let me hand it over to Kevin who'll provide greater detail on the financial results.
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everybody. Let's begin with the consolidated results on slide four. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, consolidated service revenues grew 8.3% at constant currency compared to the same prior year quarter.
At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 3.1% to over $1.09 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $55.6 million. The global mix of service revenue shifted towards the Americas in the quarter as a result of the strength in real-world and late phase research, revenue from the businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics into Q2 Solutions and the strength of the U.S. dollar.
For the quarter, the North America and Latin America region contributed nearly 46% or about 230 basis points more than the same period last year. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region contributed nearly 34%, about 190 basis points lower than the same period last year, and the Asia Pacific region remains steady at 20% plus of total consolidated revenues.
The Product Development segment accounted for 74% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 26%, a 140 basis point greater contribution from Product Development compared to the third quarter of 2014 due to stronger revenue in this segment, including the revenue from the businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics into Q2 Solutions.
During the quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 18.6% to $179 million, a margin of 16.4% with 220 basis points of margin expansion. This expansion was comprised of 160 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations across the company along with increased constant currency margins in the IHS segment.
For the third quarter, SG&A was $231.4 million or 21.2% of service revenues compared to $219 million or 20.6% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included the impact from the businesses that Quest contributed to the Q2 Solutions along with costs related to the transaction and increased compensation related costs, offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 28% during the quarter compared to 31.1% for the same period in 2014. Adjusted net income in the third quarter grew 38.4% to $117.6 million compared to the same period last year.
The current year quarter GAAP results included $12 million in net restructuring charges. These charges are in connection with both the previously approved and announced February 2015 plan, as well as a plan approved in connection with the Q2 Solutions joint venture which totaled approximately $8.4 million in the quarter for planned integration actions.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2.4 million in the third quarter, primarily due to Quest Diagnostics 40% share in Q2 Solutions. The net loss primarily resulted from the restructuring charges.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 44.6% to $0.94 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.65 per share in the prior year quarter, including an approximate $0.03 contribution from equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the current quarter, primarily gains from our NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund investments.
Our cash balance was $1.08 billion at the end of the quarter, of which $412 million was in the United States. Cash provided by operations was $269.4 million for the first nine months of 2015 compared to $175.8 million for the same period in 2014.
The net cash provided by operations during the period reflects the increase in net income, including adjustments for non-cash items necessary to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, as well as lower payments for interest and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by an increase in days' sales outstanding which increased nine days in the first nine months of 2015.
Capital expenditures were $56.7 million in the first nine months of this year or 1.8% of service revenues compared to $57.8 million during the same period in 2014. Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at September 30, 2015, was $1.4 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of December 2014.
This decrease is due to the higher cash balance, partially offset by increased borrowings from the debt refinancing during the second quarter of this year. The new business book during the quarter added $379 million more new backlog than revenue burned net of the foreign exchange impact on the backlog resulting in total backlog of $11.75 billion.
Let's now move to the two reporting segments, beginning on slide five. In Product Development, we booked net new business totaling $971 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times service revenues in the quarter, the segment's fifth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 or greater. As with the past three quarters, new business in the Product Development segment included more attractive clinical full service studies in addition to an increase from both the Quest and Quintiles' contributed businesses to Q2 Solutions.
It is worth noting for comparability purposes this was a strong quarter of full service booking as the third quarter of 2014 new business wins contain a renewal of a large five-year functional resourcing contract. Product Development's constant currency revenue growth was 9.4% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. At actual foreign exchange rates, Product Development service revenues were $810.1 million, including $33.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Product Development's constant currency revenue growth resulted from the incremental impact of the businesses that Quest contributed to Q2 Solutions in addition to volume related increase in the core clinical services, clinical solutions provided on a functional resource basis and clinical trial support services. These volume-related increases were largely due to execution on the higher backlog in place as we entered the quarter. This growth was offset by the anticipated negative impact of cancellations from 2014.
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $181.4 million, a 14.7% increase at actual rates and 8% increase at constant currency rates. Product Development income from operations margin was 22.4% in the quarter, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the same period last year, including 220 basis points of positive foreign exchange benefits which were offset by an increase in billable head count due to the ramp-up of new projects resulting from new business wins and our investment in the expansion of our global delivery network.
In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $193 million representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.68 times service revenues in the third quarter. This was negatively impacted by a large cancellation for commercial services in North America late in the quarter, as well as lower net new business for commercial services in Japan and in real-world and late phase research services. We do not expect the cancellation to significantly impact IHS revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015.
IHS service revenues grew 5.5% at constant currency rates in the third quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $283.4 million, representing a decrease of 2.1% or $6.2 million compared to the same period last year, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $21.9 million.
As expected, IHS growth moderated in the quarter with a tougher comparable to the prior year quarter. The constant currency increase in service revenues was attributable to continuation of strong growth in real-world and late phase research units, offset by lower service revenues in commercial Europe, primarily from the loss of revenue from the agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in Italy that ended in the fourth quarter of 2014.
IHS income from operations for the third quarter was $24 million, 20.9% growth at actual rates and 33.3% constant currency rates compared to the same period in 2014. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 8.5% at actual rates and 8.7% at constant currency. Margins improved 180 basis points at constant currency from a positive service revenue mix change with greater contribution from higher margin services.
Now, turning to our 2015 full year guidance update. We're updating our 2015 constant currency service revenue growth guidance to a range of 8.6% to 9.2% compared to full year 2014. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the first nine months of this year, we now expect our full year service revenues to be impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately 500 basis points compared to 2014. This is an increase of 20 basis points since our previous guidance was provided.
We raised our expectations for diluted adjusted earnings per share to between $3.27 and $3.33 per share representing growth of 21.1% to 23.3% and updated our diluted GAAP earnings per share estimate to between $3.02 and $3.11 per share. We expect interest expense of approximately $100 million for the full year and continue to expect the full year effective income tax rate to be approximately 29.5%, which translates to an expected effective income tax rate of approximately 32% in the fourth quarter of this year.
This guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates at the end of September for the balance of the year, but does not reflect the potential impact of future equity repurchases that may occur under our remaining authorizations of $110 million.
I will now turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Kevin. Sometimes numbers need a little perspective. We're proud of where we are. Let me provide my perspective on the environment, results, industry accolades, and finally some management team items.
From where we sit, we see approvals in the U.S. remaining roughly on pace with 2014, with 27 new molecular entities approved by the FDA in the first nine months of this year compared to 29 for the same time last year. The drug development pipeline continues to grow now with more than 4,900 candidates in the Phase I to Phase III pipeline, up sequentially from last quarter. These trends benefit both Quintiles and our industry. As a company, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is 1.27.
We've all watched the markets this quarter. However, according to BioCentury, during the last eight quarters, there has been more than $74 billion invested in biotech. This is more than double the $31 billion invested in the prior eight quarters. What is also encouraging is the interest by larger pharmaceutical companies in the smaller companies as sources of innovation. Both of our segments are helping emerging biopharma be successful. So this backdrop bodes well for us as well.
In terms of the Product Development segment, our RFP volumes remain strong. In addition, we're well-positioned as a few more companies are looking at preferred CRO arrangements. Our book-to-bill in the segment has been 1.2 or greater 11 quarters of the 12 last quarters. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill in this segment is 1.36. Importantly, last year, our strong book-to-bills contain some functional resourcing renewals. But in this past 12 months, including Q4 of last year, our focus has been winning the more attractive project and lab work and we have.
Regarding the net new business in the IHS segment, we have highlighted many times that it can be lumpy. Unfortunately, we had a larger CSO cancellation too, above normal. Product launches and lifecycle management still requires support and companies don't want to add unnecessary risks. Therefore, we think the backdrop is solid for this segment. As we've discussed, our real-world and late phase business is currently our fastest-growing business unit. And the aggregate book-to-bills for the past number of quarters have well exceeded those of the company overall.
We are generally managing the IHS business toward a change that will improve our margins, building more attractive, higher value-added business. You've seen that deliberate approach this year with margins growing 180 basis points at constant currency since last year's third quarter, really starting to contribute. We're disciplined managers. We may walk away from unattractive work in the CSO area. Our goal is to get our shareholders better returns.
Our customer base is diverse. We do not have a customer that's more than 10% of revenue. And 14 of our over 550 customers last year did over $100 million of business with us. As a result of the scale and diversity of the backlog and even with the strong funding and new business wins that we've talked about previously, small and emerging biopharma, it's interesting to note that we have not seen our customer segment mix change significantly over the past couple of years in terms of backlog.
Regarding revenue growth in Product Development, we're still seeing the impact of trial complexity on start-up times. We have approximately 12% more studies compared to last year in the stage between study award and first site initiation visit. And nearly 40% of studies currently in enrollment are in early stages of enrollment, which we will define here as less than 25% of the latest enrollment target.
We have a lot of new business and the products we deal with are more complex. And we have to get things right. We have put in place a multi-part program to speed up backlog burn, which benefits our customers, patients and, of course, revenue. That said, we're pleased with the overall 8.3% growth in constant currency across the business and 9.4% in Product Development.
We prefer not to talk about specific customers. However, given some of the sole-source deals we've signed, we have mentioned some of them. We stand by those customers and the actions that they are taking in their business. In fact, my view is that we need to help them figure out how to deal with the challenges they face.
We have a lot of skills here. And we can help them become more efficient when they need to, hopefully, by providing additional services that they find valuable. Specifically, because I know some of you will ask, we currently are aware of certain cancellations received in the fourth quarter. Those are expected to be offset by awards of new business.
Let me transition now to how we manage. I believe we have the best management team in the business. Since 2012, the year before we went public, we added 440 basis points to our industry-leading margins in Product Development. Since 2013, the year we went public, we've taken IHS margins up 240 basis points. Throughout our business, we're constantly seeking ways to improve quality and efficiency.
In particular, in Product Development, we continue to invest in therapeutic and scientific expertise, technology and our global delivery network which we call our GDM to improve outcomes for customers. We have talked a lot about our deep expertise in technology and our deep expertise overall. So let me mention the GDM today.
Taking a page from top service providers in other industries, a global delivery network allowing work to be performed efficiently around the world for both our customers and for us is a real contributor to maintaining margins while growing. In our case, it's actually increased margins both on a constant currency basis. And given what's happening with FX, our bottom line has helped to.
We will continue to invest in and expand the global delivery network for use throughout our business to drive efficiency, both operations and SG&A. I'm pleased to report that Q2 Solutions is off to a good start with the teams working very well together. Integration efforts are well underway and proceeding as planned. We continue to see new business book-to-bill ratios from Q2 Solutions contributing nicely to the overall Product Development average.
So what's the result of our strong focus on management of the business? Well, we're really pleased with both the EPS and cash flow that our management drives. As I mentioned and we have demonstrated, we intend to use our cash to create value for shareholders through attractive growth or share repurchases.
We're proud that we're once again recognized recently with a number of key awards which underscore our industry leadership position. We were awarded the 2015 CRO Eagle Award by the Society for Clinical Research Sites, our third consecutive year. We really appreciate this one as it's from investigators in the field.
Also, Asia Pacific CRO Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan, our seventh time out of the last nine years it's been granted. I can't say enough about what our team does in Asia where we are the clear leader. We're also named by ISR Reports the preferred provider for Phase IV, our third consecutive year for this recognition.
Our people's focus on the highest quality execution on behalf of patients and in concert with investigators remains the key to our success and the resulting recognitions. Resourcing can be tight for certain roles in this industry. And we continue to focus effort in attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry.
We have a strong management team here at Quintiles. I'm excited about some of the changes we've made recently. Kevin Gordon is promoted to Chief Operating Officer of the company. We felt it was the appropriate time for the company to recognize him for his many contributions to Quintiles. And in many ways, his new role is essentially formalizing many of the executive activities he has already been performing. As COO, Kevin will be interacting more deeply with our customers and the operations across the company.
At the same time, we're pleased to announce that Mike McDonnell will be joining Quintiles as CFO in December. We're happy to welcome Mike to our team and his deep technical expertise and experience in complex, dynamic industries brings additional depth to what we feel is the best management team in the industry. Kevin will continue to serve as CFO until Mike is on board, providing a smooth transition. I hope you will join me in congratulating both of these talented executives and welcoming Mike when he joins us.
In closing, I would like to thank the entire Quintiles team. We're working very hard for our customers and shareholders. I want to personally recognize our people for the hard work and hours they put in around the world.
Let me turn it back to Todd to begin the Q&A.
Todd Kasper - Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Tom. We're now ready to take questions. I'd like to ask our participants to limit their questions to one to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions. Janine, you may now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Your first question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks very much. Tom, I'm sure you're not ready to talk about 2016 in any details, but you called out a couple of themes in the last few minutes. Just maybe you can elaborate on those to help us understand how kind of broader growth trends might be impacted in 2016.
I think you mentioned the IHS large cancellation would not impact the fourth quarter, if I heard that right. When do you think that will start to impact IHS? In 2016? And if you're seeing any impact â I think you mentioned some fourth quarter cancellations. Would you assume that we could progress out of this sort of steady start-up phase that we've been in Product Development as we move through next year? Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Thanks, John. A few things. I think what we spoke about on the call in the prepared remarks really is that the environment that we see, even given some of the tumult in the IPO market for biotech, et cetera, we actually see solid, continuing RFP volume on the Product Development side and basically consistent trends on the IHS side. And so it's always interesting the vantage point that you sit. Based on where we sit in the industry, our access to customers, our existing customers, the environment that we participate continues to be a solid backdrop for the company.
Now the IHS cancellation was unfortunate. And you may recall that Kevin and I often talk that these burn a little bit more quickly. Now this we don't expect to impact Q4, but we do expect it to impact next year. And, right now, the team is working hard to do what they can in the fourth quarter. You'll probably recall that there are always a fair amount of renewals in that area. And you may also recall it's interesting. August tends to be a little bit of a light month for decision-making in some of the commercial environment; last year, we had a 0.84 book-to-bill in that segment. So, as we move forward here, I think, the team is working hard to make up lost ground.
In terms of the other cancellations, I don't like to speak about specific customers, but we are aware of some cancellations. And at this time, based on what we know, we believe that they will be offset by sales for net new business.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC

And the next questioner is Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. And, Kevin, congratulations for the new role. One question that I have here. You talk about like the growth that you're seeing in the lab business and obviously it's an area of focus. You're also adding the business from the partnership with Quest. So, how should we think about the growth in the lab business impacting the margin profile, assuming it's a higher margin business? Did it benefit gross profit margins? And also, I think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the impact on bookings, but if you can give us a little bit more color on that.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Kevin, do you want to â Kevin is our lead JV board member from the company. Do you want to -?
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Ricky, I think, in the prepared remarks, Tom talked about the good start that we have. I think we're in the early stages of integration, planning, et cetera. The customer reception has been extremely positive. And, as a result of that reception, we've seen the net new business on both sides of the contributed companies faring very well coming through the third quarter on a year-to-date basis. So bookings have been strong, customer reception. And the management team is off and running with the plans on integration.
With respect to revenues from the contribution from Quest, very much in line with where we had guided. We indicated on the second quarter call that we expect it to contribute about $80 million of revenue in the second half of the year. We're still very much targeted with that. Margin contribution will be somewhat muted by the purchase price amortization associated with that.
As you know, although we're a 60% owner, we do consolidate 100% of the results and really had to treat that as an acquisition. So operating margins will contribute as expected, but we will have some of the overhang from the amortization and, clearly, during the first six months of the year, some of those transaction costs that I referenced. So I still believe as we look at it, it's relatively neutral to EPS coming through this year and then accretive into next year.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And just one other question. Tom, you talked about putting in programs to speed up the backlog burn times. Taking into account like the timing of the new trial startups and the programs you're putting together, how should we think about the ramp-up of revenues for the next 12 months?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, as Kevin would warn me, we can't get into too much detail at this point in time. But I do think what our goal is really is to make sure that we're both for patients and our customers as well as it happens to benefit revenue as well. If we can do things to speed the recruiting in our trials then that benefits everybody. And so we are leader there, has a three point program to really drive at a greater level of detail opportunities to increase that recruiting speed.
So, it's early days yet but what I'd like to think, Ricky, is that we can get to historical norms. It's interesting when you have a lot of start-up work. It burns a little differently than mature work does. And as work matures, as you can imagine, you get a steadiness to the revenue because you're at a stage where, for instance, in Product Development segment, you just have a consistency of visits taking place. Whereas, in the earlier stages, you're trying to work with IRBs, make sure things get approved. There might be slight differences in different countries. And once you get further into the studies then you get a steadiness. And what we want is to have this three part program really drive us back to those historic and mature norms.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you.

And the next questioner is Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Tom, just to clarify. Obviously, you referenced some cancellations and those will be replaced with new awards. Should we interpret that as being sort of a one-to-one replacement in terms of the revenue recognition or could there be some delay just given sort of some of the time delay from when you actually getting the award to when you actually are starting to burn revenue in a meaningful fashion?
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Doug, this is Kevin. I think it's a good question. Certainly, as we look at what's happening currently, we're evaluating both what we're being notified of in terms of potential cancellations, some notified, some perhaps not yet, as well as the expected new awards that we expect to get. From a new business standpoint, we feel very good about where that's going to come out from a fourth quarter perspective. So I think we're on solid ground there.
In terms of revenue burn, as you know, cancellations can have a more immediate impact, not necessarily right away, but shorter term impact than the start-up of new awards. However, we do see a couple of the awards actually being potentially faster burn opportunity. So we're evaluating what the impact will be. We're not exactly sure which exactly will go away from 2000 into 2016.
However, I will say in somewhat in response to Ricky's question as well, we've guided to this year at 8.6% to 9.2% constant currency revenue growth which indicates a strong growth rate in the fourth quarter, which we still see coming, particularly in Product Development, very consistent with what we've talked about in the past. And that Product Development accelerates into Q4. We saw the IHS moderation as we had talked about. And we expect that occurs and stays in that way through Q4. So very much consistent with what we've guided before.
You see the revenue ramp on PD as we go into next year. We've talked about or Tom talked about the number of trials and early phase and early enrollment, the actions that we're doing. So that accelerated growth rate in PD, we do expect to continue into 2016. So not yet ready to give specifics on 2016 guidance, but things are tracking in line with what we have guided in the past. And we'll work through. And I think we believe we'll come out net positive on net new business in Q4 with respect to what's happening.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.

The next questioner is Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. Just two real quick ones. The impact of Q2 on the Product Development book-to-bill and then just the cancellations you're seeing. Are these trial failures or result of some recent consolidation reprioritizing your programs at your customers?
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Okay. The Q2 was very much in line with the Product Development in terms of book-to-bill, so coming through that. So that one is, just to get that out there, as we said, contributed nicely, so it's very much in line with the broader Product Development group coming through Q3. The cancellation in IHS obviously not related to development, but just related â nothing related to performance on behalf of Quintiles, just a customer decision. And then as far as the trials go, it's more of a reprioritization of portfolio and investment dollars by customer, reprioritizing more so into things that they've been investing in. And so it's a shift in work more so than anything.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thanks.
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
As I said, we believe we are net positive.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Perfect. Thank you.

The next question is from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations, Kevin. On the bookings, in terms of talking about replacing the cancellations or potential cancellations with new business that you see in the pipe, I guess, I was hoping to get a little bit finer point on expectations as it relates to book-to-bill for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we're kind of heading into the quarter now with knowledge of cancellations that you're providing to us. Does a replacement of those dollars mean that we should be thinking about something like a one book-to-bill or more of a standard 1.2 book-to-bill for the fourth quarter? How should that impact â what kind of net impact does that have?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think â hey, Dave, it's Tom Pike. We can't get into specifics, obviously, coming out of the quarter. But I think what we're trying to communicate is that given the environment that we see, given the RFP environment in general â and one of the things that people may forget is that we absorb some fairly large cancellations because of the size and diversity of our business. In fact, late last year, there were some. And we didn't miss a beat on them. And so I think what we're trying to communicate is while there is some press out there about one of our key customers and their situation, at this time, we expect to be consistent with what you tended to see around net new business in our segments.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you. If I can follow-up quickly on IHS. Not only the quarter being low and obviously must have been pretty sizable cancellation there, but the year-to-date is, I believe, still below one in the slides. How are you thinking about growth there? And if you could also include in that answer more color around the weakness in real-world and late phase bookings in the third quarter. So how is IHS setting up to grow or not grow as we head into 2016?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Let me start and then maybe Kevin can add to some of this. If you look across the three major areas that we have in IHS, we're really just bedding down Encore, which we purchased and looking for them to continue to evolve. And they have really set a basis for us. So there â you almost have to separate them for the last 12 months in terms of the growth that they have added to us. But we do expect that business to be solid coming into next year.
Real-world and late phase continues to be a terrific business. I mean, we are the leaders. We've got a nice recognition this quarter. The challenge that we have is it's not that large a business. So, any given quarter, there can be a little bit of lumpiness because when you're not that large a business there can be lumpiness. But their book-to-bills have been a positive contributor to our company for quite a long time and we don't see any fundamental trend shift there. In fact, if anything, over the long-term, because of what's happening with the relative balance randomized clinical trials and real-world studies, from a payer perspective, from a regulator perspective, we expect continued growth above typical company growth in that segment.
And in the CSO, when we tried to make this comment in the remarks, we're selective about what we do there. We're not trying to win every piece of business if it's not accretive to our bottom-line. And so, as we look at this year, I think, to â and you look at what we've been trying to do in terms of mix shift, the businesses that are producing more margin, we continue to be very successful with and the sub businesses, even in commercial. And then, in commercial sales itself, we're a little selective about what we do there and how we price. And that's probably reflected in the book-to-bill.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Okay.
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
David, I'll just pick up on your question around Q4. I think you heard us discuss all the dynamics in the market in our remarks in terms of our key volumes and strength of that. So when we talked about the net positive in Product Development around what we know today with respect to what is being communicated to our customers, we end up net positive on that customer. It doesn't change the dynamics of the rest of the business, which we see continuing to have very strong opportunities for and a strong pipeline for new business. I think you should look at Product Development that way. And from an IHS perspective, particularly around the commercial side of the business, you know very well that Q4 tends to be our highest booking quarter with a high percentage of renewals, et cetera. And we wouldn't expect that to change.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thanks.

Next, we will hear from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you guys were seeing any signs of a pickup in wage inflation, given a tightening labor market. And if so, if you can give us some sense of degree.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I appreciate the question. This is Tom. I think one of the things that we try to communicate on this call is we really have a two-pronged strategy around labor. One is, as we grow, we continue to develop what we're calling the global delivery network.
And the global delivery network is really a series of locations around the world that have superior skills in terms of process and sometimes technology enablement to deliver work. And they tend to be in lower-cost countries. And then, as you say, there are certain job categories. I think we have to be candid in this like the CRA in our business where it is truly a war on talent the way HR experts describe it.
And so what we're trying to do is really create the offsets in our business that we can compensate individuals and job categories where if there is a war on talent and then at the same time leverage the globality, which is really a series of investments the company has made in the 1990s to early 2000s around the world where we can do great quality of work at deliberately lower cost.
So you notice we're not mentioning that specifically in terms of our margins. And I tried to mention that not only do we get some benefit in terms of right cost at work, but we actually happen to be getting some FX benefit as well because of the strong dollar and where this work is performed simultaneously. So I think our business model is really helping us on all sides of that question.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks, Tom, for the color.

And the next questioner is Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Tom, maybe just kind of a philosophical question about how you think about longer term guidance. You've got 7% to 8% kind of longer term guidance for the PDev segment that would be kind of constant dollar organic growth. Yet, in the last three years, the numbers have tracked 6%, 3% in 2014 and then this year looks like it's going to be like 4%. And each of those years there's kind of been a one-time thing that's brought that growth down. And sure enough, as we go into 2016, it looks like there is another kind of cancellation that might bring that growth down again. So I'm just wondering. Do you foresee a time in which you really feel like you can get back to that 7% to 8% growth consistently in that segment, or has it reached a point where we really need to think about that being a couple hundred basis points lower?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I want to first start. It's complicated to communicate this cancellation situation, obviously, because knowing it, Tim. But we're trying to communicate that there is â at this time, we don't see a negative impact associated with cancellations that we're aware of in Q4. And we're still evaluating next year. There could be some timing differences as per the previous question. But at this time, we don't see a major impact, just given the scale and diversity of our business.
I think, to be honest with you, I am proud of the 9% plus growth that we had in the Product Development segment. We've tried to be consistent through a combination of inorganic and organic plays, we'll be moving towards double-digits. And I think we're really pleased with that. And so, what you're seeing in this business is for the last 12 months a very high quality, non-renewal-based book-to-bill in the Product Development segment. And this 1.36 last 12 months, if you think about, that's a strong basis for the future. So, as Kevin described, we do see, as we go into next year, continued acceleration on the Product Development side. But I think we feel pretty good about the 9% plus growth in that Product Development segment.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

And the next questioner is Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Unknown Speaker
Hey, guys. It's Luke (47:03) on for Ross today. I was just hoping to go back to the Q2, see if you guys can give any feedback that you're getting from customers on the launch and how we should think about the business going forward. And if the Q2 is helping you win any new business in this quarter or next quarter?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think, as Kevin mentioned before, this is Tom, the reception has been great. And, sometimes, I sound like a broken record on these things, but, essentially, the customers see the industrial logic of the situation that having scale in the laboratory business allows us to provide a greater diversity of services and get some scale economies in terms of cost. So, the strategy that we've spoken about where there are really a couple of leaders, us and the other guys, is recognized by the customers and really puts us in play and gives us new opportunities to come back and retell our story where we may not have them before.
We have seen a positive. During the course of this year, we have seen a positive book-to-bill in terms of the contribution of the company and we continue to think that that's a business where the larger players will get more share. And we continue to have interest: I had dinner with the CEO of a mid-size CRO. And he was very interested in starting to use Q2 Solutions as part of their business. And I think we're going to continue to see that interest because what's happening is it's becoming more and more difficult for somebody to just start up a lab given the barriers to entry that are starting to emerge there. So, I think we feel like it will continue to be a strong contributor both on new business revenue and then, with the help of Quest, really the profit line as well.

Thanks a lot.

Next, we will hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks for the question. I guess just looking at the margin trend, a couple moving pieces here. It sounds like you're still trending more towards the attractive full service work, while at the same time, you guys mentioned continuing to hire ahead of work. Can you maybe just give us a sense of when you expect to lap the increased head count? And how much more profitable â or only even directionally, how much more profitable should we be thinking about the full service contracts relative to the more functional ones you mentioned signing more of in the past? I think, ultimately, just trying to get a sense of if we got the margin trajectory right here.
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
In terms of hiring, Bob, I think, both Tom and I remarked that we're investing in the global delivery network. Tom explained to you a little bit about what that is. So where we can use that as efficiently as we can is where we're actually ramping some of that up to take greater advantage of in the future. So there is a greater add there.
In relation to some of the hired skill there, as Tom talked about, whether that's the CRAs to complete the work and â across the globe is one where we're continuing to add, but we tend to add those at the right pace in respect to the need for revenue acceleration. So, at the right time in the trials, we'll add those folks. It's a really balanced supply-demand approach as to how we do that hiring. So there is some investment going on there in relation to the revenue. So we're matching that as best we can in terms of the margins.
I think you see from a margin trajectory in Product Development, even on a sequential basis, the margins both on actual rate and constant currency rate are the same in Q3 that they were in Q2, sequentially. So we're continuing on that trend. And although we're balancing it, we're maintaining that higher margin as we continue to make some of those investments.
The number of trials that are coming through, we'll continue to add to that. We'll have to make some investments around that. But, again, we do the best, I think, in our business in terms of matching those with the revenue trajectory. And that's been our ability to maintain and/or grow the margins to where we are today.

And the next question is from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.
Allen Lutz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey. This is Allen on for Garen. Can you touch on the mix of new business wins in the quarter in Product Development in terms of size? Was there anything worth calling out there?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a good question. It was really pretty much a traditional mixture size-wise. And it's a good question because, again, people could think about the outside environment and wonder. But if you think about it, we're still in this environment of tremendous scientific events, some really interesting therapies, some really interesting emerging biotech. And so our mix was really quite consistent with prior quarters with some large, medium, small. We did have a fair number of transactions this quarter that made up the total volume in Product Development. But in terms of â if you took the median, it would probably be pretty consistent with what it was in prior quarters.

And next question is from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks. Just picking up on some of the earlier questions on margins. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the improvement in IHS? You've guided to 6% to 7% last quarter. You are doing better than that despite an FX headwind. So can you maybe talk about where you see the sustainable level of margins for IHS going forward?
Kevin K. Gordon - Executive Vice President, Operations; Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer
Tycho, it's a good question and I'm going to give you the same answer, I think, we always do from a consistency standpoint. We expect the overall margins this year to be slightly higher than last year from a full year standpoint. So, last year, I think, we finished out in just over 6%. If you look at it on a blended rate, we're moving those up on a year-to-date basis. We're just over 7% on an actual rate in IHS. So I think it's fair to say that from what you see in our guidance we're about in that range.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, Tom, can you comment on the IMS collaboration? Was this something that came about as a result of customer feedback and any color you can provide on revenue sharing?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. In fact, it's a combination. So, for those who don't know, we announced in the press release couple of weeks ago that we have a collaboration with IMS in particular around real-world data. And what's happening is we're seeing this thing that the industry calls a hybrid registry which is a combination of using current electronic health record claims and other data and combing through that and then also doing some custom development of primary data, so that you can get greater insight into specific questions about what's going on in the real-world.
And what we found, sitting down with IMS â and I sat with their CEO. I think what we find is that our deep analytical and epidemiological skills actually complement their deep availability of data and their global strategy in particular for bringing that data to customers. And so what we've done is we're working together in the near-term on a number of client related situations where they have asked for hybrid registries. Sometimes, this comes from the customer. Sometimes, it comes from us or sometimes it comes from IMS frankly as an idea. And then, over the longer term, we're looking to figure out ways that we can create differentiated intellectual property with them as we move forward in that important segment.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then just in terms of the economics, how do the economics work?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We can't really just talk about that. But, essentially, the way â it's largely projects that we do together and so there are clear â it's not a complicated thing.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Steve, you may be on mute.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC
Yes. You got me. Apologize. So, good morning. Just on the CSO, obviously, you addressed the fact that there's going to be just a change in marketing strategy from one of the customers. But just curious, on a higher level, are there any noteworthy trends going on in the marketplace, perhaps maybe hopefully another trend back, any sort of in-sourcing, sort of, maybe a higher level amount of whole swapping of contracts amongst CSOs? And, again, is there maybe a shifting in demand for the service due to any other changes in marketing strategies, just in general? Just curious if we could get some more high level thoughts on to CSO market trend. Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean with the CSO, essentially, the basic demand picture is the same. So you are continuing to see some organizations look to variablize. As I mentioned in my remarks, you are seeing product launches, given the approvals. The thing that is true about that industry and I think we have to acknowledge is it's extremely price competitive. And there are different players coming in and out, some of whom are private, and you can't really see some that are part of larger ad agencies and things.
And so the thing for us is just making sure that, as the leader in that segment, we win good business. And it's kind of that simple. We want to win good business. And if it's not good business, then we're not as concerned about winning it. So what we don't want to do is just have revenue only type wins in what we do. So the backdrop is okay. Europe is a complex market, but still continues. Japan is a complex market, but still continues to have demands. The U.S. has quite a number of product launches, but the key for us is really picking our spots and winning the work that we want to win, and just to give you a sense.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC
