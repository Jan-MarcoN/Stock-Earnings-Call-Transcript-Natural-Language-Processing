Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Corporation Second Quarter Results Conference Call.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Jason Thompson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Connie. And good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler, Mark Rajkowski are here to review our second quarter results. And we also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.
Notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.
John A. Luke
Jason, thanks very much. And good morning, everyone.
We continued to make solid progress in the second quarter, generating profitable growth despite what continued to be challenging global economic conditions. Our results demonstrate that our strategy is working. We want all of our shareholders to understand our financial performance in a detailed level, as well as the strategy that's behind our progress, and we'll cover this as best as we can before turning to your questions.
We have positioned MWV to outperform through participation in attractive end markets, supported by commercial and innovation capabilities that improve our overall mix and generate profitable revenue growth. At the same time, we're improving the efficiency of our operations and eliminating unnecessary costs. As a result of this continuing work to build and execute a differentiated strategy, we have delivered solid performance improvement in the first half of this year. And we're confident that we'll continue to make more progress in the quarters ahead.
Our efforts are directly reflected in the 6% sales growth across the company in the second quarter, including revenue growth in our core packaging businesses that exceeded both global GDP and broader industry growth rates in many of our packaging markets. As we noted last quarter, we're intensely focused on ensuring that our top line growth is much more fully reflected in our bottom line performance through operational excellence and overhead cost reductions. The work we've done in these areas over the past year has put us on track to deliver more than $100 million of permanent annual savings and achieve market-leading margins in 2015. We nearly doubled earnings per share in the second quarter compared to last year, and we increased adjusted EBITDA by almost 30%. Through the first half of this year, we have increased our adjusted EBITDA to $448 million.
Looking at our performance in the second quarter. There are several developments that punctuate our progress, and they include significant gains in EBITDA and EBITDA margins in Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty compared to last year; pricing and operating productivity improvement in Brazil; record quarterly performance in Specialty Chemicals; and a strong contribution from our major capital investments and cost-reduction programs. I'll comment briefly on each of these.
First, our significant gains in EBITDA and EBITDA margins. Bob Beckler will go into more detail on the drivers of our performance in each segment, but it's clear that our market participation strategies are working. We're better leveraging increased sales of our differentiated packaging solutions with strong operational performance.
Second, in Brazil, we're producing more paperboard following our mill investments, and we've been successful at price increases in our corrugated markets despite the very tough economic conditions and continued uncertain outlook for the rest of the year in Brazil.
Third, in Specialty Chemicals, we continue to demonstrate there is even more headroom for profitable revenue growth in this business both now and in the future. We expect to operate this business in a manner that increases the intrinsic value for all of our shareholders.
And finally, solid contributions from our major capital investments and cost-reduction programs. These initiatives have always been part of our aim toward industry-leading margins, and we're seeing the positive impact on our quarterly performance. We saved $21 million in the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our goal of $75 million in savings for this year, with a run rate of $100 million or more.
As I noted at the outset, we're very focused on generating profitable growth and improving our financial performance despite the current soft global economic conditions. Overall, customer sentiment and consumer spending, market demand have been marked by slow recoveries in Europe and the U.S. and uncertainty in many emerging markets, notably Brazil and India. We remain very positive about the longer-term outlook for these markets and are in particular very encouraged by the uptick in FDI in India in the wake of the recently concluded national elections. The growing middle classes in India, Brazil and other developing economies represent a powerful economic force, which we are especially well positioned to capitalize on.
Our recent performance gives us confidence that we have the ability to continue on the vector we've established toward industry-leading growth and profitability. We'll work to build on our momentum from the first half of the year, as there's much more ground to cover. Everyone at MWV is aligned and determined to achieve our goals, and we're confident that the strategies we have in place will lead to earnings and cash flow growth this year and market-leading profitability in 2015.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for additional commentary about our performance and outlook in each segment before Mark Rajkowski talks about the second quarter financials. Bob?
Robert A. Feeser
Thank you, John.
The story in each of our segments during the second quarter was about execution of our commercial and operational strategies. On the whole, we were very successful, and our performance demonstrates how our growth and productivity investments continue to accelerate progress toward our goal of industry-leading profitability. I would now like to step through each of the segments with some brief highlights for the second quarter, as well as our outlook for further improvement in the third quarter.
In Food & Beverage, sales and earnings increased significantly. It was a very good quarter for this business compared to last year. Sales increased 5.5% in Q2. And EBITDA margin improved to better than 17%, an increase of over 400 basis points. The sales and margin growth was achieved broadly across the segment's markets with profitable market share gains, pricing and mix improvements relative to last year. Shipments were especially strong for our bleached, SBS paperboard grades for premium food packaging, food service applications such as cups and plates and tobacco packaging. Beverage packaging based on our unbleached CNK also grew with many of our key global and regional brand owners. Machinery placements achieved over the last few years continue to pull through solid volume growth for beverage cartons, especially in Asia Pacific. Even in North America, where consumer demand for soft drinks and beer has been more challenging, we have picked up some share by choosing the right partners and diversifying our customer base. As such, we have good momentum heading into the second half.
Our manufacturing operations ran well in the second quarter, and we maintained solid backlogs for both bleached and unbleached coated paperboard. Wood costs, wood availability and rising logistics costs remain challenges, as we noted in the previous quarter, and I'll come back to that point in just a moment.
In the third quarter, we expect Food & Beverage segment profit to be above last year's levels. Our order backlogs are expected to remain strong for most of our markets, especially so for bleached board. CNK demand is expected to hold steady, with strength in global beverage helping offset some weakness we are seeing in frozen food demand. We expect continued good operating performance in our mills, but as noted, wood and logistics inflation are higher than expected as we move into the second half. Given ongoing strong SBS demand and the need to offset these costs, we have announced a price increase for bleached board for the upcoming quarter.
In Home, Health & Beauty, sales and earnings were again up strongly, and our EBITDA margin improved more than 400 basis points to 16.3%. This business has good momentum on the commercial side, with volume and pricing gains, and is operating well with an improved cost structure. Sales were up double digits for our dispensing solutions, especially fragrance pumps and hose-end sprayers for lawn and garden care. We also completed our transition to Shellpak Renew, a paperboard-based version of our popular adherence packaging solution for health care, and turned to positive profit in that line of business despite the transition costs. Initial impact from recently announced price increases across the Home, Health & Beauty business also contributed $2 million of improvement during the quarter, and the full benefit will carry forward during the second half of the year.
In the third quarter, we expect Home, Health & Beauty earnings again to be higher than last year, though slightly below the second quarter level. This is a seasonally slower period for the segment following the springtime peak of the home and garden season and accounting for holidays in Europe. However, we still expect higher productivity from our operations and continued commercial gains in the third quarter.
In industrial packaging, results were mixed this past quarter, with sales up but earnings down versus prior year, largely impacted by weak economic conditions in Brazil. The earnings comparison was also negatively affected by FX impact, a significant flood event in the region of our Tres Barras mill and several onetime benefits that occurred in Q2 of 2013. Excluding these items, totaling $5 million, earnings increased modestly versus prior year.
This year, we have seen the economy in Brazil continue to soften, with GDP now forecasted to fall below 1% growth for the year. In particular, markets slowed sharply in June as Brazil consumers and manufacturers reduced activity during the World Cup soccer tournament. Things are expected to bounce back from this very low level, but it will still be against a relatively weak backdrop. Despite the present challenges, we continue to execute well on our Brazil strategy and on the controllables. In the corrugated packaging side of the business, while volume was unfavorable, we moved effectively to offset inflation with pricing actions in the second quarter, the full effect of which we will see in the third quarter. And in Tres Barras, the expanded kraftliner and medium-board mill continues to make good progress. Several factors led to higher operating costs in the quarter, including the flood previously noted as well as some aggressive trial work in the mill focused on further product and process improvements. Commercially, we were achieving excellent results with our new high-perform linerboard. This new range of kraftliners is exceptional in quality and gaining share in South America and other global markets. This success gives us the flexibility to run our mill operations to produce as much as possible and balance demand in the paperboard market with internal demand for our corrugated business.
In India, where we are the highest-quality material supplier to the corrugated market, we are winning new business from our brand owners, who have specified products based on performance and our ability to deliver lower total cost of ownership. Sales in India increased by 12% in the quarter. This is still a developing market but one where we see good potential from the growing middle class and the recent shift toward pro-growth national economic policies. We are still optimizing the India investment, including a new paper machine in Morai, and as such, the business recorded a slight loss in the second quarter.
Our overall outlook for the industrial packaging segment in the third quarter is for modestly higher profits compared to last year. Specifically in Brazil, we still envision being above 25% EBITDA margin by year end leveraging our expanded world-class mill assets. Despite the current economic uncertainty in Brazil, we remain confident in the foundation and the flexibility to maximize value in paperboard and corrugated packaging as economic conditions and consumer demand drive expected growth over time.
And finally, our Specialty Chemicals business continues to operate very well and perform strongly and consistently in its key markets, reaching new records for sales and earnings during the second quarter while increasing EBITDA margin to 27%. We are achieving growth broadly in asphalt, oilfield and activated carbon by gaining share and improving mix with innovative product formulations. We see significant upside in each of these specialty markets and the opportunity to drive additional profitable growth over time. In activated carbon, for example, the business continues to grow in the global automotive sector by offering technologies to control evaporative fuel emissions.
In the third quarter, we expect segment profitability in Specialty Chemicals to reach a similar level as reported last year, a quarter that benefited from $8 million of onetime legal and insurance settlements. We will also have a heavier outage schedule in this business during the third quarter compared to last year.
So overall, our segments are performing well and continuing to make steady progress toward our goal of industry-leading margins for each business. Though total economic activity has remained weak globally, our differentiated strategy has enabled us to outperform on a relative basis and will provide additional opportunities for profitable growth. We are taking advantage of those commercial opportunities and leveraging our success with improved operations to deliver profitability that will ultimately be in line with our closest peers and competitors.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Bob.
We continued to improve our financial performance and underlying business model this quarter with solid commercial and operational execution across our businesses as well as continued bottom line benefits from our major capital investments and cost-reduction activities. The result was significant year-over-year EBITDA and EBITDA margin improvement. We're confident that these efforts will continue to drive strong year-over-year performance improvement over the second half of this year and, ultimately, industry-leading profitability for each of our businesses.
We have a lot of momentum and expect to continue to deliver earnings growth in the third quarter despite some challenging economic headwinds in certain markets and rising fiber costs. A few of the highlights of our improved execution in the second quarter include increasing revenue by 6% through volume and price/mix improvement across each of our segments; substantial improvement in our operating margins on an adjusted basis, almost 400 basis points; in addition to our commercial and operational success, we delivered on our growth and productivity investments and on our cost-savings program. We also improved free cash flow, excluding items, to $37 million in the quarter from higher earnings and lower capital spending. I'll provide some details on the key drivers of our second quarter earnings improvement then discuss our overall outlook.
Our strong financial performance started with 6% sales growth driven by execution of our commercial strategies, reflecting the positive momentum we began to build during the first quarter of this year. As you see in the slides, the year-over-year volume and price/mix contributions were significant at 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively. These benefits were partially offset by currency and business dispositions completed in the quarter, principally the European beauty and personal care folding carton business.
We had notable top line growth in the Food & Beverage segment from gains we're making with our higher-value paperboard solutions and solid volume growth in the Home, Health & Beauty segment from continued commercial gains with our differentiated plastic pumps and dispensers. Drivers of revenue growth in the Industrial segment included higher pricing to offset inflation in Brazil, as well as higher paper sales in Brazil and India, partially offset by weaker underlying demand for corrugated boxes in Brazil. And the Specialty Chemicals business continues to make gains in targeted high-value pine chemical and activated carbon markets.
Our second quarter 2014 adjusted enterprise EBITDA increased 26% to $257 million or 17.5% of sales, which is a 280 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago quarter. We generated outstanding leverage in the quarter from our intensified focus on operational excellence. We also saw contributions from our productivity investments and cost-savings program, which together added almost $40 million to adjusted EBITDA during the quarter on a net basis. Our adjusted gross margin in the quarter improved almost 400 basis points to 21.7%.
Adjusted SG&A declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 10.6% of sales. Benefits from our cost-savings program in the quarter were $21 million, including a 20% reduction in corporate department costs, resulting in year-to-date savings of $30 million. Our SG&A cost savings in the quarter were offset by a $20 million year-over-year change in compensation-related accruals. The change is largely due to the reversal of incentive reserves last year related to the operational challenges that we had, where we reduced management's compensation based on performance. We'll realize additional cost savings in the back half of the year, and we remain on track to achieve our 2014 goal of at least $75 million in savings.
In addition to continuing to reduce our overhead cost structure and progressing towards industry-leading margins, we're also evaluating a new methodology of allocating corporate costs to enable us to manage and report our segment financial results consistent with our peers. We plan to complete this work in the fourth quarter, at which point we'll finalize our approach and timing of recasting our segment reporting.
Quickly turning to cash. Cash flow from continuing operations in the second quarter was $151 million versus $167 million last year. While net income was higher, working capital levels grew primarily due to higher receivables from a strong commercial performance late in the quarter. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to improve on a sequential basis from both stronger earnings and lower working capital levels. Normalized free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow after CapEx, dividends and excluding cash restructuring, was $37 million.
Our CapEx was lower compared to a relatively higher investment period last year. CapEx year-to-date is down almost $100 million, and our full year 2014 outlook remains around $350 million.
Now turning to the outlook. As we look ahead to the third quarter and second half of the year, we will continue to execute well on the controllables, including volume growth and price/mix gains from our commercial strategies; strong operational productivity across our mills, plants and other facilities; and substantial cost savings in line with our plans. We expect these elements will continue to drive strong earnings growth in the second half of the year.
We're also working to address several external factors that may impact the magnitude of our expected third quarter and second half performance. As John noted, the economic outlook in some of our markets remains uneven, particularly in Brazil where economic conditions are significantly weaker than we and others expected. Despite a weaker economic climate, higher-than-expected fiber costs and a $30 million adverse impact from weather in the first half of the year, we still expect to deliver between $1 billion and $1,025,000,000 of adjusted full year EBITDA, which represents year-over-year improvement of at least 25% and puts us squarely on a trajectory of industry-leading margins by 2015.
John, back to you.
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks very much.
Let me conclude our formal remarks by saying that the path to industry-leading margins is a clear one for us. We have to continue to execute on our commercial and operational strategies, increasing revenue through differentiated participation in growing markets and delivering benefits from our major investments and cost-reduction actions. We've done well through the first half of the year, and we expect to continue that momentum in the quarters ahead with the goal to significantly increase earnings and cash flow this year and achieve the industry-leading profitability that we and our shareholders expect.
We'll now turn to you for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have our first question from George Staphos.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I'll ask a couple 3 and then turn it over. The recasting of the financials with the reallocation of the corporate expense, if you had completed with your analysis in the third quarter, would it be fair that you'd be in a position to do the recasting by the fourth quarter? Or would be -- or would 2015 be a more realistic target? And then secondly, when we talk about achieving industry-leading margins across your segments, could you remind us about how you're going to, if you will, put your segments on a comparable basis relative to peers, and what adjustments we should make? And are you there for the whole of 2015, or are you hoping to get there at some point during 2015?
John A. Luke
George, let me begin, and I'll turn it right over to Mark to get to the specifics of the -- of your question. Clearly, we're committed to moving forward with the reallocation as rapidly as we can. And if we're ready sooner, we'll get out sooner. And obviously, we'll look to present that in a manner that is readily comparable from your standpoint. We would clearly look to drive those industry-leading margins as rapidly as we can in 2015. We have the capability to -- in place to drive those and that's what we will look to do, but certainly, we're committed to being there by the end of the year. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
John, you summarized it pretty well. We expect to be completed with the work in the fourth quarter, George. And then we'll -- at that point in time, we'll decide whether we want to recast then or wait until the first quarter of 2015. And the purpose of this is really to provide more transparency around how we stack up versus our peers and the competition on an apples-to-apples basis.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. So just a clarification and a follow-on: This will be on an allocated basis and it'll adjust also for pension income, so it'll be apples-to-apples as best that you can. Would that be correct? And...
John A. Luke
Absolutely, yes. George, yes, we're going to -- it'll be a much fuller allocation of corporate costs and excluding pension income.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. And the follow-on, just in Industrial and specifically Brazil. Obviously, you can't control the macroeconomic conditions, but in aggregate, the performance has been disappointing relative to what your expectations would have been back in 2010, 2011. Are there any learnings from the investment that you made there, what you found? And anything that you would have done differently, and what you can do going forward to get the returns and margins up given the context of a tougher environment?
John A. Luke
George, thanks very much. And I'll turn this over to Bob Beckler to comment more fully. I think we've learned a tremendous amount, but most importantly, I think the team has done a very, very good job from beginning to end. Our expectations for ramping up performance were record setting in terms of our overall expectations. And we darn near met that. I think we ran into some complexity given the magnitude of the project. That's no excuse, but those are things that applied to our learning and certainly we will carry forward in all that we do. But I think we're most excited as we look forward, economic conditions notwithstanding, about the power of the investment that we've made. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Yes. And just to add to John's good comments: The fundamentals of the project are still very sound. And we really like our position strategically as the markets evolve. Yes, we didn't draw it up this way in terms of the Brazilian economy and the impact that, that is obviously having on the corrugated sector, but we're executing very well in this environment. We're taking pricing actions to offset inflation despite the tough conditions in the market. We're operating with discipline in terms of where we place our new paperboard across the business. So balancing between the internal demand for our corrugated packaging business with the external demand, which has been quite strong both in Brazil and for export markets. So while a tougher environment perhaps than we or anybody else might have anticipated at this stage, we feel good about how we're executing and the fundamental flexibility and competitive strength that our strategy gives us in Brazil.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
John, since the conference call started, I've gotten 5 different emails from clients asking if you're going to sell Specialty Chemicals, so maybe I could ask the question this way. In the past, you've said that you would be willing to sell that business if you could get enough value to make it fair and cover your tax hit. Presumably, lots of people have talked to you about this business. Has your view on your willingness to sell changed in any way?
John A. Luke
Mark, I'm not at all surprised that you've gotten those emails. I would have thought maybe you've gotten a few more...
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
The rest of them probably went to you.
John A. Luke
I'll check after the call. In all seriousness, we have and continue to actively evaluate all opportunities to create shareholder value. And given the interest and focus in and around Specialty Chemicals, you can be sure that we are continuing to actively evaluate the logic of such a potential. I think everyone knows that we have a very good track record of creating value for our shareholders by disposing of businesses that may not fit our strategy. As we've noted publicly, that amounts to some $4 billion over the -- roughly the past decade that's been returned to shareholders. We believe that there is significant upside value in the chemical business. And any transaction, should it occur, has to contemplate not only the structure but timing that would let us maximize fully the value intrinsic in that business.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
John, one more question more specifically on your Food & Beverage business. Clearly, U.S. soft drink demand is not that great, but your numbers have been pretty good. Can you talk about how much of that is beer, which you did mention? And how much is coming in non-beverage markets like food and nonfood applications?
John A. Luke
We'd be happy to. And I will turn to Bob Beckler to comment more fully on that.
Robert K. Beckler
Great question. We're very pleased with how we're performing in beverage. The North American dynamics get a lot of the headlines, but in fact, it's a global business for us that is running strong in multiple theaters. So it's about a combination of things. It's the commercial focus that we have in those end markets. We're finding that responsiveness to the markets and changes in the markets is, more than ever, key to success. Our customers are changing over lines faster, looking for more differentiation, and we're responding to those changes with our global capabilities. We're also picking the right spots to participate. We have very good relationships with the large brand owners and are working very closely with them to help them be successful in their very competitive markets. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks the machinery strategy that we have in the business. This is not something new. This is something that has been longstanding in the business. It's an investment every year that we make to provide more flexibility, more capability, greater productivity for our customers; and helps pull through our innovative, high-quality packages for the long term. So it's a combination of things working well for us. The point you made in your question is true, that we're holding steady in the CNK part of our business largely in part, right now, to the great strength that we're seeing on the beverage side, which is helping offset a little bit of weakness that we're seeing in frozen food.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
And maybe just following up a little bit on the comments, John, you were making on the Specialty Chemicals. I think, in the past, you've indicated that half of the equation is finding a way to maximize the value of the Specialty Chemicals, et cetera, but that part of it too was also wanting your packaging business to -- gotten to the point where you want it to get for the timing to be right. First of all, is that a correct assessment? And if it is, the Specialty Chemicals business obviously is doing terrifically. Have you gotten the packaging business or how close are you to getting the packaging business to where you want it to be?
John A. Luke
That has been a consideration over time. And obviously, as we evaluate the business, Mark, it is appropriate to consider as well. The most important thing, though, is to ensure that we're creating value for our shareholders overall, and that's what we're looking to do: one, by evaluating, as you said, suggested -- the logic of a chemical business transaction; and secondly, actively working, with our focus on industry-leading margins and the overall participation strategy we have in packaging, to ensure that is right. And we don't see any undue restriction limiting our actions on either side. We feel very bullish about the opportunities that we've got in packaging.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
John, just an obligatory MLP question for you. How serious are you in considering putting your virgin paper mills into an MLP structure, if you could get a private letter ruling, which obviously you can't do today?
John A. Luke
Adam, happy for the question and another one that is coming. That is, it's not at all a surprise. Clearly, with the focus on MLPs, we are actively, as you would expect, evaluating to understand the mechanics of such a transaction given what could be a source of great value creation. As others in the industry have commented, we've read and as we've talked to advisers, these are complicated transactions and it would be premature for us to comment one way or another. The message we would like to leave today, though, is that we will actively evaluate the MLP concept and its fit for any portion of our business and then be prepared to come out and comment more fully what we've learned and what direction we would pursue.
E. Mark Rajkowski
And the other thing I'd add. I think we've got a pretty good track record of always looking at creative ways to maximize shareholder value and we're open to new ideas.
John A. Luke
That's right. Complication doesn't -- complicated transactions don't scare us off. You've learned a lot.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Right. That's right.
Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
And just one on SBS. Obviously, you announced a price increase recently, effective September 1. And none of your competitors has followed as yet. Can you just talk about how healthy you consider that market; and what the import threat, as you see it, is from Europe, Brazil and China, for that matter; and whether this increase, if it's successful, could attract more competition from those markets?
John A. Luke
Adam, be happy to, and I'll ask Bob Beckler and/or Bob Feeser to follow as well by adding additional color. First of all, we've announced because in the markets we participate in, we see demand to support that, but equally important is a determination on our part to ensure that we're appropriately covering what has been inflation, most notably on the wood fiber side of the business. Both of those factors are ones that drive our pricing decisions. And to your question about imports, we have not yet, in our -- the markets we serve, been in any way thwarted by import threat. Importantly from our standpoint, it's the logic that we're pursuing it to do the right thing for the business overall. Bob Feeser, comments to second that with?
Robert A. Feeser
Yes, yes. Adam, just to build on that. We've had good success with our pricing actions in the first half of the year, pricing up 6% both in SBS and in CNK. And the focus around the price increase, as John mentioned, is to recover the costs that we're seeing in the second half. So we're very much committed to maintaining our important model of covering cost inflation with price. It's still very early, but we fully intend to do everything we can to cover that cost inflation in the second half. And as John mentioned, in terms of import pressure, we're very well positioned with our differentiated substrates in our end markets. While it's always there as a potential, and we monitor it closely, we have not seen any significant impact from import and expect that to be the case going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I just want to check. Mark, you mentioned the EBITDA target and you used $1 billion to $1,025,000,000. Is that correct?
E. Mark Rajkowski
That's correct.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Can you just remind me? Because I thought, last quarter, we were talking about a slightly higher number in light of the more recent cost-and-improvement program.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, we're executing very well on the controllables, Gail. I mean, you've seen that particularly in through the first half of this year and whether it's gaining share, driving price, a lot of productivity coming out of our mills. We're taking our costs. But I think it's important that we'd be transparent on the factors that are external that are impacting our business. And the economy has not gotten any better. In fact, in Brazil, it's gotten -- it's worsened. It's weakened. We're seeing a lot of pressure on our input cost, particularly around fiber. We're trying to absorb a $30 million impact that we saw through the first half of the year, on weather. And we're doing a good job of clawing back a chunk of that but those are big factors. We're continuing to drive as high as we can and -- but what we feel good about is even at the lowest levels, we're going to be up 25% year-over-year on EBITDA. And we're squarely on track to achieve those industry-leading margins that we expect to in 2015.
John A. Luke
Yes. And I think, Mark, you've said it well. Let me just reinforce, Gail, that all of us are very focused on the higher end of that range and we're not going to throw in the towel, by any stretch. We're going to continue to work on the remediation initiatives. Why? Because that's obviously our job but, secondly, because the business model we have in place is more than capable of meeting that level and more. But Mark has, I think, very carefully outlined some of the noncontrollable factors that we're facing and the range adjustment from a transparency standpoint as one we just wanted to get out there.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And just looking at Food & Beverage a little bit. Were there any -- and I apologize if you've cited [ph] and I just missed it. Were there any kind of one-off-sy operating issues? Because if I think about and looked back last year, you had a big issue at Covington with an outage, plus you've got the benefits of the boiler and pricing. And it just seems like profitability isn't seeing as much of a boost given the swing factors. Was there kind of any one-offs that might go away over the next couple of quarters?
John A. Luke
Gail, thanks. Let me ask Bob Feeser to comment on that.
Robert A. Feeser
Yes. Gail, really no onetime operational impacts in the quarter. In fact, all of our mills ran extremely well, most of them running above planned production levels for the quarter. So we feel very good about how the mills are positioned for operating going into the second half as well. The third quarter, while we do have some outages in the mills that are normally planned across the mills, it should be again a very strong operating quarter in the third quarter.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And finally, just a couple of questions on Brazil. I guess it's early days, only a couple weeks, but have you seen any sense of change since the end of the World Cup? And can you just give us some sort of sense of the internal consumption versus the external consumption in terms of board? How much are you selling on the market relative to what you're consuming at this point?
John A. Luke
Bob Beckler is freshly back from Brazil and poised to respond to those questions.
Robert K. Beckler
Well, it's certainly interesting times in Brazil. We've not seen anything like the month of June, I would say, in the last 5 years, where major customers across the country took both federal -- extra federal holidays but also, in some cases, forced vacations of as much as half of the month in order to respond to the slowing consumer demand that occurred over the Cup. Our customers are telling us, though, that they are beginning to see the rebound from that. July will not be a full rebound because, of course, the Cup stretched over that period. But as we get into August, our customers believe that they'll be back certainly to the pre-Cup levels of performance. Plus, the second half of the year tends to be seasonally better for the corrugated industry on the whole, and we're beginning to see that already in July.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And board sales, internal, external?
Robert K. Beckler
Right. We don't exactly break out the split between internal and external, for market reasons, but I can say that we've really had good success with the growth of the paperboard business. We've grown 20% in total paperboard volume in the market over the last year. And we've also positioned ourselves with 20% market share in Brazil. So very good commercial progress on the paperboard side. That's given us, as we said before, tremendous flexibility to balance across the system and maximize value of the total business.

And the next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Just a couple of questions. Would you be able to elaborate more on what is driving the wood fiber inflation?
John A. Luke
Bob Feeser, you're poised to cover that. I think there are a variety of factors, but you might hit a couple of the principal ones.
Robert A. Feeser
Yes. Alex, really a couple of things. Primarily in the southeastern part of the country, in part, weather in Texas. We continue to see wet weather that's making it more difficult for logging conditions in that part of the market. But I think the more important aspect is higher demand for wood within our wood baskets driven by pellet mills in the Southeast, again particularly in Texas, Alabama and in Georgia. We're seeing again higher demand against those wood baskets to really driving cost up, and we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future. So the outlook that we have talked about in terms of wood cost, that really is the principal driver, I would say.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay, that's very helpful, Bob. And then just on the SBS side and looking at the backlogs there. They're well above where the CUK side is. I'm kind of thinking about the end markets that doesn't appear that they're so different. So can you just talk about what is driving such a higher backlog level in bleached board versus the CUK business?
John A. Luke
Bob?
Robert A. Feeser
Alex, yes, I would say a couple of items there. We continue to see nice demand growth in our food service business in particular. That business is coming through a strong cup season. And we've continued to see good demand through the summer months and continue to expect that in the second half. The other source of strength is also on our liquid packaging business: strong global growth in that business, in particular in Asia Pacific, as well. And that's been an important part of our SBS growth.
Robert K. Beckler
I will just add. This is Bob Beckler. I would just add, even more broadly, even the food side of that, that business has held up fairly well. The non-food service food side has been relatively stable. And we've seen really good performance across the specialty side of that business, the tobacco board and the commercial print applications that have very high quality demands.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. Have you seen any market share shifts in the beauty or personal care markets in the U.S.? It seems a competitor reported weaker results in North America relative to yours.
John A. Luke
Bob, do you prefer to address that?
Robert K. Beckler
As we indicated in our comments, the commercial approach that we're taking across beauty and personal care, not just North America but globally, has been very successful for us. The thing that I can point to there without getting too much into share so much is that we've really been working hard to position our focus in the most attractive markets in particularly beauty and personal care. Our fragrance applications for sprays have been particularly strong for us in North America certainly but abroad as well. So we're very pleased with the commercial gains that we're making in the business. And we see that continuing as we look to the third quarter and well into the next year.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Great. And can you sparse out what specific end markets in Specialty Chemicals are driving the strong growth there?
Robert K. Beckler
Sure. This is Bob Beckler, and I'll take that one as well. So broadly, Specialty Chemicals is doing very well in pushing more of the mix into the high-value specialty end of the business. So that would be oilfield, asphalt, ink resins, adhesives. And on the activated carbon side, as I mentioned before, very strong performance in the automotive sector. This is the strategy of the business. It's not something new. This is something that they're constantly doing to continue to push both mix and the profitability of that business up. And we've invested in that business because we see tremendous upside to continue growing in all of those markets that I mentioned, in most cases, double-digit potential growth every year in those businesses.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Great. And just one last one. Do you see any change to your strategic initiatives for the company just in the context of high-end shareholder activism recently?
John A. Luke
Our strategic priorities remain very much the same. And we believe that those are the absolute best ways to generate the industry-leading margins we have targeted as well as the initiatives that have been advanced by a range of shareholders.

The next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
One quick verification. You mentioned the EBITDA target, the $1 billion to $1.25 billion (sic) [$1.025 billion] . I just want to be sure: Is -- the pension element of that, which I -- I suppose to be about $120 million or so, that's actually noncash. Is that the way to think about that?
E. Mark Rajkowski
That is correct.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Okay, just wanted to be sure. And then I guess, a question on the Specialty Chemicals business. I remember, when you all invited a number of us down to Charleston 3 years ago and we got a chance to visit that, there's this -- I came away with the impression that the margins at that time that were -- then looked very good but aren't as high as they are now might be a little bit above kind of a normal level given the money you would be spending on growing the business. And you've actually successfully grown the business with the markets you're in, and yet the margins have actually gone up. And so now that you're looking ahead and seeing more opportunities, and you pointed out activated carbons in automotive, within automotive, do you now think that you can grow the business without any real change in the margin, all things being equal?
John A. Luke
Chip, I'll ask Bob Beckler to comment much more fully on that, but I think your recollection is sound. And what we have seen, as Bob has alluded already, is a step change in performance that is supported by a sound investment in market development as well as continuing focus on innovation and participation strategies that really let us leverage the capabilities we have. And I think these margins are clearly sustainable margins. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
No, that's right, Chip. 3 years is a long time ago. And a lot has transpired, I think, since that investor conference. And we've really exceeded expectations over that period and not in a spike way. It's really been sustained over the last 3 years with EBITDA margins annually above 27%, which is about the run rate that we're at now, and we see that continuing as we go forward. What's happening that's driving that is the mix shift and the growth in those specialty markets that I described that are highly differentiated, that respond perfectly to the kinds of products that we offer that are different in those end markets. In some cases, it doesn't take a lot of investment to capture that kind of value because it's mix shift that's occurring within existing assets, but in other cases, it's global growth that's occurring that we're moving to invest and position ourselves for to stay out in front with the capability to maximize the value of those opportunities.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Got you, and that's very helpful. And then just one last quick one, for Mark. I might have misheard you, but I think you said that -- and as part of getting to the $75 million in cost saves, that I think the first quarter was 18 and the second quarter was 12. So I guess it looks like the quarterly run rate is still quite below that, but I might have misheard those numbers. How should we see that flow through the -- correct me, for the first half? And how should we see the second half?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Chip, it was $9 million in the first quarter, $21 million in the second quarter. And we're looking to ramp up in line with that second quarter level.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Right, right. Which would already get you to $84 million on an annualized rate. That's very clear.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde [ph].
Unknown Attendee
Bob, just a question, first, on Rigesa. It sounds like you're selling into the export market and you're selling into that kind of the domestic board market down there. Is there -- should we assume that there is a lift as you can integrate more of that into your own converting business and bring the export tonnage back onshore in Brazil over time?
Robert K. Beckler
That's exactly right, Mark [ph]. That's the balance of this business that we work every day to maximize the profitability of the corrugated platform. It was the whole basis for the strategic investment that we made in Brazil several years back that we continue to work. The other balance that we strike on the corrugated side, particularly in a tough market, is to maximize our margins. And so we keep a very disciplined focus on the inflation in Brazil and offsetting that with both price and premium mix opportunities. And we're not pressured to push more of the board into the corrugated business just for the sake of volume.
Unknown Attendee
Yes, I think you've -- from what I can tell, you've been pretty disciplined about price down there. Is there any way, Bob, to just help people think about sort of that transition over time kind of as you pull back export tons and increase integration on the sort of financial impact and the timing?
Robert K. Beckler
Well, without getting into the financials so much, the idea is that we have enough capacity with the expansion that we did in Brazil to ultimately double the size of our corrugated platform and, along with that, double the profitability of the business. We still have our sights set on 30% EBITDA for the integrated packaging platform. We still believe that's very achievable. A little bit of a timing issue around the economy in Brazil, but we're tracking well.
Unknown Attendee
Okay. And then just a couple of other questions, one on any further divestitures that you guys anticipate this year. I think part of what's been helping you in some of the margins has been kind of getting rid of businesses like those carton businesses in Europe. So anything else likely over the next 6 months?
John A. Luke
Mark, go ahead.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Mark, we constantly look at our business mix and how it's performing in the marketplace and the relative business model and the ability of those businesses or product lines to generate increasing levels of economic profit. And the market is a dynamic place, and we continue to keep that squarely in focus. So we think we've got a lot of that behind us, but things can change and we have our eye on the ball.
John A. Luke
I think that's right. And markets are, as Mark indicated and everyone knows, dynamic, and we're certainly seeing that right now. But the lens through which we're continuing to evaluate this ultimately comes back to the continuation of the economic profit drive and discipline that we have here and across the company.
Unknown Attendee
Okay. And then just on the other side of that: Are you interested in just really trying to improve existing operations in packaging right now? Or could we see you consider acquisitions over the next 6 to 12 months; and if so, acquisitions of any size?
John A. Luke
Mark, let me answer it this way: that we clearly evaluate opportunities as they come along. We feel we've got a strong obligation to do that. But to the first part of your question and as our comments today, hopefully, on the call have reinforced, we see significant upside by focusing intently on the strategies we have in place, with the assets we have in place and with the markets that we're continually improving our participation within. Again, that said, we don't turn away from things that might represent opportunities, but our primary focus here and across the company is on executing the strategy we have right in front of us.
