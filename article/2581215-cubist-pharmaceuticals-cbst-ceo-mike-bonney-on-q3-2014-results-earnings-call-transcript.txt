Good day. My name is Patricia, and I will be your event specialist today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cubist Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please note that todayâs webcast is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
At this time, I would like to turn todayâs program over to Eileen McIntyre, Vice President of Investors Relations. Ms. McIntyre, the floor is yours.
Eileen McIntyre
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our review of the third quarter 2014 business performance and financial results for Cubist Pharmaceuticals.
Before introducing our speakers, I will read the Safe Harbor statement and describe the context for our use of non-GAAP financial measures. Todayâs presentation includes forward-looking statements relating to our business, including those set forth on this slide. We may also make forward-looking statements during the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, and there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these forward-looking statements. These and other risk factors are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements are made as of todayâs date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP figures in order to provide greater transparency regarding Cubistâs operating performance. Please refer to the slide being shown regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures, as well as additional slides on the Investor Relations page of our Web site, which contain the reconciliations between our non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP financial measures.
Speakers on todayâs call will include: Cubistâs CEO, Mike Bonney; President and Chief Operating Officer, Rob Perez; Chief Scientific Officer, Steve Gilman; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Tomsicek. Weâll first hear from Mike Bonney. Mike?

Mike Bonney

Thanks, Eileen. As we announced yesterday Cubist will soon complete a leadership transition, consistent with a well-considered succession planning process that has been underway for a number of years. This will be my final earnings call as CEO of Cubist. Following a deep and broad consideration of candidates the Cubist Board of Directors unanimously and enthusiastically has approved the appointment of Rob Perez as Cubistâs CEO effective January 1. At that time I will retire as an employee of Cubist and become chair of the Cubist board on which I have served for the past 11 years. This leadership transition for Cubist allows for a new perspective at the helm going forward, while at the same time continuing the effective and productive relationship Rob and I have built over many years working together. I very much look forward to my new role as for chair starting in January. But today as Cubistâs CEO I am pleased to lead our discussion of another strong quarter of performance for Cubist.
Q3 was an important quarter. We are continuing to make progress in key strategic areas that can unlock value embedded in our building blocks of growth goals. I am also very pleased with how we are tracking against financial objectives and operational milestones for 2014. This was a strong quarter for our top-line with double-digit net revenue growth across the product portfolio. We also saw improvement in the bottom-line. We are beginning to see moderation of R&D expenses related to getting ceftolozane/tazobactam to its initial filing stage.
Overall our operating expenses were down for the quarter versus last year. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income in Q3 of 99.1 million was up by almost 90% compared to the third quarter of 2013. Importantly, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.29 compared to the loss of $0.50 per share a year ago. Rob and Steve will share more about our recent operational and development accomplishments. But first I will turn it over to Mike Tomsicek for his review of the financial results for the quarter.
Mike Tomsicek

Thanks Mike. We have reported a very positive quarter with good results and revenue across the board. On the expense side Iâll point out a few important details. GAAP COGS for the quarter reflects the first full quarter of amortization of SIVEXTRO, as well as amortization of DIFICID and ENTEREG. This is also the first quarter when synergy savings from the Trius and Optimer acquisitions were fully realized. SG&A expense reflects headcount added for the first phase of our international rollout. R&D is later this quarter. This reflects the completion of the initial NDA-related clinical development and regulatory activities supporting ceftolozane/tazobactam.
In the recent months we completed NDA regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and the EU. This quarter we reversed approximately $14 million of clinical trial expense accrued in prior quarters based on updated final cost estimates received from our CRO. This reversal relates to our reconciliation of Phase III complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal trial expense for ceftolozane/tazobactam where lower third-party billings following trial conclusion led to lower trial costs than anticipated.
Finally as of June 20th we have capitalized the manufacturing materialâs expenses for ceftolozane/tazobactam. So these costs are no longer reflected in R&D expense this quarter. Operating income for the quarter shows considerable improvement versus Q3 last year, reflecting both revenue growth and the reduced expenses I just discussed. Q3 non-GAAP net income of $52 million was up 60% versus Q3 of 2013.
Now turning to guidance, starting with revenue. As we said at mid-year we continue to expect Cubist in U.S. and total net revenues for the year will come in at the low-end of the guidance range we have previously provided. Regarding costs, weâre adjusting the guidance for gross margins for the full year to a range of between 76% and 77%. Reflecting inventory write-offs associated with our previously announced recalls. Based on our latest projections through year-end we are now lowering guidance for our expected R&D spend for 2014 to a range non-GAAP of between $375 million and $400 million. There is no change to our SG&A guidance. We are now guiding to full year adjusted operating income non-GAAP in the range between $205 million and $225 million. For cash, cash equivalents and investments we now expect to be around $700 million at year-end.
Now, over to Rob.
Rob Perez

Thanks Mike. Before commenting on our strong Q3 results and operational highlights for the quarter, I want to say a few words about our upcoming transition. On behalf of the entire Cubist organization, I salute Mike Bonney for his extraordinary leadership as CEO of Cubist over the past 11 years. The important therapies weâve delivered to physicians and the patients they serve, as well as the results weâve delivered for our shareholders during Mikeâs tenure have created an enduring legacy. As important for the future though is the depth and breadth of the talented organization that we have built under Mikeâs leadership. It will be an honor for me to step into the CEO role in January.
In the next couple of months I expect to engage with many of you as I objectively review our business. In due course I look forward to sharing additional thoughts with you, but suffice it to say that I plan to build on our strong operational and financial foundation while leading our continued efforts to address unmet medical need for acutely ill patients.
As you have heard this was a strong quarter for Cubist. Iâll start with some perspective on our top-line growth. CUBICIN revenue growth reflected some modest vial growth in the quarter, as well as price increases taken this year. This is the first quarter where CUBICIN U.S. net revenue at $257 million is at an annualized run rate of greater than $1 billion. This is the first for an IV-only antibiotic. As youâve heard me say for the past couple of years, CUBICIN is well established for use with appropriate patients and provides a strong and growing foundation for our expanding product portfolio. One update to share with you regarding CUBICIN is that a third fill/finish provider is now approved and able to ship product.
This is the first quarter in which Cubist is reporting revenue for SIVEXTRO. As you would recall we launched SIVEXTRO immediately after FDA approval at the end of June with an oral formulation and followed with the IV which was available in early August. Weâre pleased that in the first quarter weâve already had a couple of dozen hospital formulary approvals, including some large academic centers on the East and West Coast. A large number of formulary reviews will get underway in the fourth quarter.
In its initial three months of availability in the U.S., SIVEXTRO has had good initial uptake primarily of the oral formulation for use outside the hospital, facilitated by our patient support program access SIVEXTRO. This outpatient use is consistent with the product positioning thesis underlying our acquisition of this asset last year. The revenues weâve reported today represent real demand as there is no wholesaler stocking of SIVEXTRO. Overall, the SIVEXTRO profile has been received favorably and the once daily short six day course is seen as a differentiator.
Iâm pleased to report that weâre making progress with DIFICID, as reflected in the U.S. net revenue of $17 million for the quarter. In Q3, the second full quarter of our re-launch of DIFICID, shipments to the wholesale channel were up by 10% versus Q2 of this year. This is good to see especially following the July 1st price increase while weâre starting to see the impact of the Cubist commercial and medical affairs teams, we have a lot of work ahead of us to realize the potential of this important therapy. Our DIFICID re-launch program begun in February has focused on three important initiatives, positioning DIFICID for use in appropriate patients, building new relationships with key opinion leaders outside of the ID space and improving patient access to DIFICID.
We have targeted use of DIFICID for patients at the highest risk of recurrence and those who are most impacted by the consequences of an extended bout of CDAD. Our discussions with key opinion leaders reassure us that this positioning is credible and provides the clarity needed in identifying DIFICID patients. As I mentioned last quarter weâve also enhanced the DIFICID patient access program so that all eligible patients prescribed DIFICID can receive the support they need to acquire the drug. Weâve learned a great deal from targeting gastroenterologists who treat patients outside of the hospitals. We see significant opportunity for growth here and are considering some steps we might take going forward to increase our reach to gastroenterologists who see a lot of CDAD cases.
We continue to see very nice momentum for ENTEREG. This is a year when weâve tried a different approach for ENTEREG as we expanded our U.S. product portfolio. Weâve been quite targeted with our direct sales activity focusing on institutionalizing the uptake of ENTEREG in more integrated healthcare systems. And we have begun to use non-personal marketing to increase awareness of ENTEREG among the broader surgeon audience and to inform the healthcare community about ENTEREGâs expanded indication approved last year and other surgeries including radical cystectomy. The success weâve seen this year with ENTEREG is quite encouraging and bodes well for the long-term potential of the product.
As we begin the fourth quarter, weâre in the final stages of preparing for the anticipated U.S. launch of ceftolozane/tazobactam assuming approval by the FDA in late December. As we announced in todayâs news release, we now have a brand name for ceftolozane/tazobactam. ZERBAXA also weâre in a very good shape with ZERBAXA supply and expect to have inventory ready for order and shipment following approval. The fall scientific meetings in the U.S. have a lot of focus attention of the infectious disease community on the unmet medical need associated with multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogen.
With that, Iâll turn it over to Steve.
Steve Gilman
Thanks, Rob. Iâll start with some highlights from the recent fall infectious disease meetings. This year Cubist had a total of 71 poster or podium presentations, 47 at ICAAC and 24 at IDWeek. This very strong showing across multiple products and programs underscores Cubistâs leadership from the search and development of antibiotics for difficult-to-treat infections caused by challenging pathogens, including those with multi-drug resistance.
Of note, global surveillance data continued to underscore the wide spread prevalence of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas, as well as ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella across the world. Subset analysis of our ZERBAXA Phase III data reiterated the in-vitro potency and high clinical response rates of ZERBAXA observed in our Phase III trials against these pathogens. Several posters were presented that provide additional insights into the safety profile of SIVEXTRO, for example in the analysis of the proved data from the SIVEXTRO Phase III skin infection trials in which SIVEXTRO was compared to linezolid, patients treated with SIVEXTRO had a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to linezolid 16% versus 23%. SIVEXTRO also had a numerically lower incidence of abnormal palette count, absolute neutrophil count and hemoglobin across all time points evaluated compared to linezolid in this combined analysis.
During Q3, we continued to make important progress on multiple pipeline programs, a particular importance of course if our Gram-negative antibiotic candidate ZERBAXA currently under review at the FDA for initial indication saw in both cUTI and cIAI. As part of the FDAâs regulatory process we have now successfully completed all preapproval inspections and are engaged in label negotiations with the agency. As you know, the PDUFA date is December 21st.
During Q3, we also filed an MAA with the European Medicines Agency or EMA seeking approval of ZERBAXA in the same indications. Generally the MAA review process with the EMA takes about 12 to 15 months, so we would anticipate action there in the second half of next year. Both the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation prophylaxis trial for DIFICID and the Phase III trial for Surotomycin are enrolling well and we continue to expect top-line data for both of these trials in the mid-2015 timeframe.
Turning to Bevenopran, our candidate in development for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, we continue to expect to underline our Phase III long-term safety trial by the end of this year and weâll then meet with the FDA to discuss a more feasible design for Phase III efficacy studies. Finally, regarding our Phase I beta lactamase inhibitor, CB-618, we are actively engaged in discussions with the regulatory authorities, so stay tuned for an update on the path forward here.
Now back to Mike Bonney.
Mike Bonney

Thanks, Steve. All at Cubist are working hard at delivering on both our financial guidance and operational milestones for the year. And as shown on this slide much has been accomplished of Q3. Itâs my job as CEO through December 31st to ensure that we remain focused on executing well against all of our 2014 goals, while moving through a smooth CEO transition. During this time it will be important for Rob to have lead responsibilities for longer term planning that will impact 2015 and beyond that aspect of the transition is well underway.
With that letâs open up the lines for your questions, operator?
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Thank you. And your first comes from the line of Terence Flynn.
Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs

Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats to both Mike and Rob on the news. First on SIVEXTRO, I was just wondering if you can give us any insight into the hospital formulary review process and just how SIVEXTRO is being positioned in those formularies in the hospital setting. Are there any restrictions relative to Zyvox? And then the second question is just on the R&D. As we think about the run rate here going into next year if we add back that 14 million reversal is 80 million a quarter kind of a good runway to think about as we go into next year? Thanks.
Rob Perez

So, Terence itâs Rob. Regarding the hospital formularies, I think itâs first of all itâs a good time for me to say that hospital formularies are obviously a focus of our activity right now. They are not the Bl indole or an IV oral antibiotic. But certainly itâs better to be on formulary than not on formulary. That being the case, the hospital formularies reviews that have been undertaken so far for SIVEXTRO have been very positive. The positioning is generally as an agent to use to transition patients outside of the hospital that really is the major advantage for SIVEXTRO. Itâs helping to get people out of the hospital. So while the formulary decisions are not specific to just that use. Thus far the positioning has been very similar to Zyvox. We havenât seen restrictions that it has to be used after Zyvox or things like that, though individually within each hospital it can been very-very different. But so far we are very pleased. We recognized that a lot of formulary reviews wonât take place until the fourth quarter. It often takes time for you to even get on the formulary process. So the fact that some major academic institutions move so quickly on SIVEXTRO suggests that the unmet need is there and people see the differentiation in the product. So, so far so good but itâs very early. And maybe I will give the R&D question over to Mike.
Mike Tomsicek

Yes Terence. The idea of adding back the 14 that you have mentioned, I think is a good idea to understand and reflect where we are from an R&D standpoint today, where we will be going forward we will shed more light on with our guidance in January. And that will involve trading off the increases in R&D that would come from ramping up half of that trials and the decreases from some other trials we have going.
Eileen McIntyre

Operator, we have another question?
Operator

Yes. And your next question comes from the line of Jason Kantor.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse

Thanks for taking the question and Mike congratulations on a great run, itâs been amazing building of the Company. I think you have done a great job. So you deserve some time away from that. And Rob congrats as well. I was hoping you could shed some light on the demand growth for CUBICIN I know that was a big issue last quarter in terms of you seeing a softening in the staff market. I am wondering if you could give us kind of an update of your thoughts there and how that played into the quarter. And just from a housekeeping perspective could you give us some info on the gross to net as well?
Rob Perez

Sure, Jason this is Rob. And the short answer to your question is that vials were up quarter-over-quarter that is Q3-over-Q3 last year by 4.4%. So we did see an increase in vials in the quarter. It does allow me the chance to remind everyone that kind of the positioning of where we see CUBICIN in our overall portfolio. I said this in quarters where vials were a little bit down and I will say it in this quarter where vials are up. And that CUBICIN is really the foundation of our growth. And we see overall revenue growth to be in the low double-digit growth annually which is something most companies would kill for to have a foundation thatâs at the $1 billion run rate level and still growing. So weâre going to see some fluctuation in vials up or down based on kind of low single-digits but overall where CUBICIN is performing as we expected so, little bit stronger this quarter than weâve seen in previous quarters, but CUBICIN continues to grow on a pretty steady pace.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse

And the gross to net?
Rob Perez

The gross to net was at 16.7% for all our products and 16.5% for CUBICIN, that gross to net in Q3 of 2014 is about 3.3% higher percentage points higher than it was last Q3. So we saw a bit of an increase.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse

But if I could just follow-up on the demand growth I know that low single-digits is kind of the bogy but last quarter you highlighted the fact that you thought that market overall might have been shrinking in that quarter unexpectedly Iâm wondering if you can give us an update on the overall market?
Rob Perez

Yes the overall market is basically flat, it continues on a quarter-over-quarter basis to be down a bit, it was down a bit in the quarter by about 3% to 5%. The data does kind of fluctuate a bit but weâre seeing essentially a flat to down overall most of the market I think what that leads to then is a bit of a tick up in CUBICIN share. We saw CUBICIN share increase to 13.5% with our most recent data, so thatâs very good news particularly in light of the new competition that is now entering the Gram-positive market. So the market overall is kind of flat to down but good share movement for CUBICIN in the quarter.
Jason Kantor - Credit Suisse

Thank you.
Operator

Thank you and your next question comes from Adnan Butt.
Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets

Hi there, congrats and best wishes to Mike and Rob as well. I have some questions, first I was wondering if there is any greater visibility into when any decision might be expected in the patent litigation? And then secondly could you talk a bit about demand going out of the quarter for SIVEXTRO? And then finally for Steve, Steve you mentioned 618 developments, should we assume that the Phase I, and Phase I/II is completed, could you expand a bit on that? Thanks.
Mike Bonney

So let me handle the litigation Rob will pick up the SIVEXTRO question, and Steve can pick up the 618. Unfortunately Adnan no one here has any influence Judge Sleetâs calendar. So we have no better insight into predicting when Judge Sleet will make this decision that we did in the last quarter.
Rob Perez

And regarding SIVEXTRO demand, early on it is really the first full quarter of sales and really with only the oral available for the entire quarter. Itâs tough to draw any conclusions from the sales number thus far itâs very-very early. Where itâs right where we expect it, we werenât expecting a massive pick up of this or any other new antibiotic for that matter. I think whatâs more indicative and provides more enthusiasm for us is just the response that we have heard in terms of how quickly hospitals are moving to review SIVEXTRO for formulary and how the formulary reviews have gone thus far and the positive outcomes weâve had. So thatâs probably the best predictor at this point Adnan itâs still very-very early and the IV was only available in the very last part of the quarter, so, so far so good but still very early.
Steve Gilman

And regarding 618, Adnan I think we talked about this last time, weâve completed the Phase I single and multiple ascending dose safety and PK trial so we know the concentrations we can achieve we think theyâre good and the safety profile seems fine. And so what weâre doing now is taking that information and talking to regulatory agencies to discuss the path forward into more of a streamline pathway frankly than through a sequential Phase II, Phase III program like weâve done in the past. So itâs something that weâre just in the stages of discussion and exploring with the agency.
Adnan Butt - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks.
Operator

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison.
Matthew Harrison - Morgan Stanley

Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations to you on the transition, I thought two things, one on OIC specifically maybe you can, I didnât hear Steve comment but given what weâve seen with the approvals and sort of the post market and your clients any thoughts on what you might do with your program now? And then separately on light maybe you can just comment on why now, why you thought this was a good time for the transition, obviously the company is in a bit of transition itself by launching new products and with the new operation. So, I thought it would be helpful if you could just comment on why you thought now is a good time?
Mike Bonney 
 
Steve, you want to take a go actually first?
Steve Gilman
Yeah, I think obviously within following the movement to other products through the agency and those have been relatively positive. What weâve said before and I just to reiterate that compo trial we, the Phase 3 FC trials we agreed to conduct with the agency under the owners of the concerns of the cardiovascular risk. It was a trial we feel that a year or so ago and really couldnât regroup efficient way against the trial because you hit a lot of bells and whistles to measure cardiovascular facts. So given this new movement, given our Phase 3 long-term safety data, we intend to then go back with the agency and discuss a more feasible trial. I am assuming that the trial, the safety program looks good and we get good conversation with the agency then we decide whatâs appropriate for us to do after that.
Mike Bonney
 
Now with respect to your question about why now, it's really a couple of key things that I sort of would call philosophical, one is I think CEOs in our space, not be true of all CEOs, but I focus mostly in our space having half-life and I think it's very important for organizations to have new CEOs. I have been either prisoner CEO of Cubist for 13 years and it just felt like thatâs been a heck of a run. The other thing that was the timing quite frankly was and for many of you this is history that you probably donât know, but when I join Cubist and became CEO, we had a very narrow hand to play. And then those early years that was a source of some frustration for me to, I guess I would say that it didnât have more asset to my disposal to try and figure out how to create value for shareholders and make a difference in patient life. So I made a commitment to myself after the bacteremia and endocarditis read out in 2005 that if I was fortunate enough to be able to choose the timing of my departure which I have been, I would do it at a time when my successor wherever he or she might be would have a strong hand to play and boy it really looks to me like I am leaving Rob with a very strong hand to play.
So those were the two key factors that drove my timing decision here. And I am just thrilled with Robâs both can see and what he will do for the firm, I am going to remain a very large shareholder for quite some time and I think my families holdings are in very good hands.
Operator

Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Eun Yang.
 
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.

Thank you. Rob, I just want to make sure that I heard you correctly. You say for Cubist why it was up 4.4% is the year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter?
Rob Perez
Q3 2014 over Q3 2013.
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.
So, when you look at sequential growth from second quarter to third quarter it's about 9%. How much of sales growth is coming from vial increase versus a price increase?
Rob Perez
Did you ask that question again the vial increase versus price increase?
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.
Yeah of course the sales growth, what contribution do you give from vial growth versus price increase?
Rob Perez
Yeah, I am afraid I donât have that information directly at my disposal. Why not we check into that or take the next question and weâll come back to you?
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.
So you know some of the Companyâs that have already reported they said that hospital utilization rate has gone up for the last couple of quarters. And they see the trend to continuing going forward. Do you see that benefitting CUBICIN uptake?
Mike Bonney 

In terms of overall hospital senses?
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.

Yes. 
Mike Bonney 

There are so many factors that influence the overall market. And therefore CUBICIN itâs hard to kind of to pick one of them. We have seen quarters where at least hospitals have reported that their senses is down and in some instances its correlated with CUBICIN volume and other instances itâs been completely the opposite. So itâs hard to say that itâs absolutely correlated. It has to have some level of correlation. I think itâs probably more true that when you have more sick patients in the hospital there is a higher correlation. I donât know how we can get at that number. But what we tend to see is patients who are in hospitals for more elective care and who are kind of in and out of hospitals thatâs probably less likely to have an impact on CUBICIN volume, because those donât tend to be CUBICIN patients. The CUBICIN patients are the patients who are more sick and were positions are likely to put them on a product for more days in the hospital. So I know thatâs not a direct answer. I donât have the numbers but thatâs probably how it correlates more or so than overall senses.
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.

Thank you. And then last question to Steve. I donât know if you made a comment on this, then I might have missed it, CXA-201. Previously you were planning to start a Phase III trial for HAP and VAP by mid of this year. Can you give us an update on that?
Mike Bonney 

Yeah. We are still doing that trial. We have talked about it; the trial is getting launched in fielded. What we did is actually combined some sites between todayâs [ph] VAP trial and the CXA-201 as we now call SIVEXTRO trial. And so that we can have more trial efficiencies so we can use less sites and have both a grand positive and grand negative trial running in the same sites so that we have sort of refigured some of our sites and we expect to actually have first patient in fairly shortly. The most important thing is we think that things we are doing now will actually complete the trial more quickly independent of when the first patient is actually dose [indiscernible] are being set up and screen is in underway so just matter of time now. 
Eun Yang - Jefferies & Co.

Okay, thank you. 
Rob Perez

And I have the answer to your question from before. About one-third of the growth is from vials and two-thirds from price. We had 9.4% growth quarter-over-quarter with 3.5% coming from vial. 
Operator

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mario Corso.
Mario Corso - Mizuho Securities

Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to echo congratulations to both Mike and Rob. The couple of things I wanted to ask about I guess number one on that CUBICIN case with Hospira. I know they are difficult questions to answer but I guess they have to be asked. Is settlement still something you should be thinking about as the possibility and I guess as presumably if there isnât a judged verdict by December 01 than there would have to be more interactions with Hospira in order to perhaps have that deadline extended? And then on business development. What are your thoughts there now with an increasingly competitive hospital antibiotic market? Are you looking more at non-antibiotic areas perhaps than you were 6 months to 12 months ago? And then finally on SIVEXTRO. I am just wondering obviously its early but the early formulary experience. Are you seeing any instances where SIVEXTRO is replacing Zyvox on a formulary? And is at the shorter course thatâs really the hook there in terms or outpatient or is it the potential safety advantages. Thanks very much. 
Mike Bonney 

Okay, so Mario let me handle the first one the CUBICIN case. This is not in any way intended to suggest legal strategy here. But if you look at the total universe of Paragraph IV challenges, they settled from very early to very late. So thatâs just sort of informational background. With respect to December 1st as we said at the last call, in order to save the cost and time associated with filing preliminary injunction we would certainly engage with Hospira as we approach December 1st to look for an opportunity to extend that date. We wonât file the preliminary injunction there will lot of risk. So stay tuned for that. 
Next up is Rob.
Robert Perez

Yes, on the BD front Mario as far as anti-infective assets we still see ourselves as the worldâs leader in anti-infective and we see ourselves frankly the preferred partner in anti-infective. So we see everything in anti-infective and feel like if there is asset that weâre interested in bringing in at any stage that we have the ability to do that. So the fact that there are other players in the anti-infective commercial market I donât think really impacts that in terms of our ability to get assets that we like. Now we are also because of our experience weâre discerning buyers.
So there are a lot of things that we look at in and decide we donât want to take but we still feel very confident that if there is something that we think it makes sense for Cubist that we can access to.
Our focus really in the BD front is on assets that would be accretive in the very near term be the anti-infective or otherwise particular in the hospital as well as things that would help to offset the investment in Europe. So those are kind of the key areas that weâre looking at right now.
And your last question was about SIVEXTRO and whatâs driving hospital formulary inclusion. It really is a combination of things. The shorter course is beneficial but not as much for the hospital because in skin patients those patients are often in the hospital for that long so the shorter course is not as bigger deal. What is a big deal are potential safety benefits of SIVEXTRO and frankly the convenience to the patient and thatâs where both the short course and the once daily administration is very helpful once daily oral that is.
So just the idea of having a product that they can feel comfortable in in terms of convenience in safety profile to right a prescription coupled with the service that we wrap the round SIVEXTRO so that eligible patients can have access to the product and the physician prescriber can feel confident that their patients going to get it and get it quickly are the reasons that I think weâre seeing the uptake and seeing hospitals at SIVEXTRO the formulary. So that will give an idea of where we are.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Skorney.
Morgan Haller - Baird

Hi good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on the -- and this is Morgan on for Brian sorry about that. I just had a quick question about the tax charges you all took in the third quarter is little bit higher than normal, can you just talk about what went into that and why itâs little bit higher? Thanks.
Mike Bonney 

Yes, the guidance that weâve given on taxes and now confirm is that our cash tax for this year is near zero because of the use NOLs and the tax rate that youâll see in the quarter will be impacted by things like continued consideration and other intricacies that lead to our reported tax rate but I have been leaning towards guiding on cash tax because again the cash tax we expect to pay this year is near zero.
Morgan Haller - Baird

Okay, great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America 

Is it reasonable to assume that ZERBAXA will be primarily used in the inpatient setting and thatâs not reimbursed separately and is the case, how do you think about the value proposition of that product to the hospital and how would you compare it to the value that CUBICIN represents to a hospital?
Robert Perez

Yes Steve its Rob. Yes, ZERBAXA and frankly all of the gram-negatives are much more inpatient driven than outpatient. So the outpatient dynamic that exist in the gram-positive market but there is some outpatient used it the mix different and itâs much more of an inpatient opportunity. As far as the value to the hospital, the value proposition remains the same from an economic standpoint in terms of if you can have fewer days in ICU and fewer days in the hospital for these sick patients then obviously that represents significant savings for the hospital into the DRG. So, there are still chances to show economic benefits and obviously the clinical and efficacy benefits to the patient are obviously most significant. So, there is the ability to treat these patients who are very, very sick and often in ICU and get them to a step down ward if you will is a big win for the hospital and a key reason why they need efficacy in these patient to the ground negative setting.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America 
 
And in order to pricing that value of either a reduced inpatient stay or a step down as you refer to, do you need that hospital base experience in pharmaco economic data in order to capture that value in your price?
Steve Gilman
 
Well, weâve been able to capture that value in our price, in our other products as well and we have developing hospital or health economic data. We wonât have all of the health economic story done at launch and ever do that will have the beginnings of the argument from the Phase 3 studies and then weâll work with our hospital customers to develop the data in their own settings to be able to show the benefit there. But it is more than just what the health economic value is that goes into the decision making and using these products. Remember when you are taking about patients with multi-drug resistant Gram-negative infections, you are talking about very sick patients, who have likely already tried and in many instances have resistance to the cephalosporins in the first line therapy. So you are staring at a patient who is very, very sick and facing the fight of their life. So, while health economics matters in that situation youâre really looking for efficacy and efficacy against the most important pathogens and that is really what ZERBAXA if the FDA agrees with us and weâre able to launch in December what weâre hoping to be able to prove.
Steve Byrne - Bank of America 
 
And if I can squeeze one more in there with you Rob. What fraction of the table form of SIVEXTRO occurred in the quarter as a result of your drop shipment overnight to patients as opposed to there being dispensed and picked up at the retail pharmacy level and how would you say that has affected the person of scripts being filled versus the historical rate for Zyvox?
Rob Perez
Yeah, it's a good question Steve. Weâre not actually given that information that we do feel like it's a little close to competitive advantage for us. Weâre very excited about access SIVEXTRO, I am very excited about the role its playing in SIVEXTRO launch, but weâre not going to go further than to give the detail.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore.
Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Company
Congratulations Mike and Rob. Rob, I was just wondering how much of your time will be spend now building out the European commercial infrastructure and can you give us a sense of your or your teams experience in launching drugs at U.S.? And then maybe frame for us on the go forward for Cubist, what the levels importance of success in Europe is to the, to the next few years for the company? Thank you.
Rob Perez
Sure. Well Ken all of that has been all of our senior management team have had involvement in our international build. I have been responsible for international in that general manager in Europe does report to me. I have had some experience previously in leading international efforts in working with in a previous company, but most importantly and frankly the most important decision that I made was bringing on Patrick Vink, who is our international General Manager, heâs a very experienced international leader who has worked at Big Pharma and led a very diverse hospital organization in Europe previously and I am looking forward to having all of you get to know Patrick a little bit more. But Patrick has done a fantastic job in building a very experienced team. So, one of the key I think variables or decision points for us is how well we would be able to recruit people into Europe given Cubist didnât have a presence in Europe itself previously and that question has been answered. Weâve been able to recruit really a top notch team of very experienced individuals who have worked in large pharmaceutical companies as well as help to build the international operations for other biotech companies. So we are in very very good shape locally with the team. And we are all spending time, and I will be continuing to spend on Europe with Patrick and building that out. 
As far as how important it is for us, it remains one of the growth drivers we think we will have for Cubist going forward. While we are very excited about the role that our international team will play in our current products and most importantly for ZERBAXA as you know the growth opportunity for ZERBAXA is significant in Europe. Frankly, as large as it is in the U.S. But my expectation is that our international business will ultimately be a growth driver in an itself we will be able attract products into that organization that maybe we couldnât attract in the U.S. because of the organization we built and because other companies are going to be going to the same process that Cubist went through frankly where they are going to want to launch themselves in the U.S. but need partners outside of the U.S. So we believe that the international business is not only going to help out with our current portfolio but will help us to attract assets in the future. So it remains an important part of our growth story.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Alan Carr.
Alan CarrâNeedham & Company
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations to Rob and Mike. Couple of them. One of them I wanted to come back to the pneumonia trials. Can you I guess give us a little more details on where those two trial stand percent of sites opening? When you expect to have data from them? And the other is can you give us a few more details around DIFICID and who is prescribing it now and how thatâs changing with your new marketing strategy earlier this year? Thanks. 
Mike Bonney 

So the SIVEXTRO trial of is up and running as you heard we have started first patient in. We donât give out metrics on patients in months and trial sites for a lot of competitive reasons Alan. But the trials often launched. These are multi-country, multi-site, hundreds of site of kind of trials. So they are large and complex. They will take a while. As I said sites are already screening in the now ZERBAXA trial. So we do expect these trials to take a couple of years. We have said before and I will just reiterate that we are going to guide people to once the trial is really up and running and we get some six months or more of enrollment metrics then we will be give an accurate production at the end of the trial. But itâs going to be measured in the 2017 or â18 range. 
Robert Perez 

And regarding DIFICID. I am very impressed and pleased with the organization and its ability to assess and learn. I think we have proven that a number of times and we are doing that with DIFICID as well. The commercial team has done a great job of mapping out the kind of buying process for DIFICID where patients are treated, where different types of patients are treated. And we are learning some new insights. In particular, we are learning kind of what role of the plays and itâs still a significant role but also what role physicians outside of the hospital play. And I mentioned in the script the GI Audience. One of the things that we have learned is that the infectious disease position whether an ID gets involved really has more to do with the severity of see that not necessarily whether itâs a recurrence or not. The GI tends to see more of the recurrent patients in many instances. So we are starting to kind of map out where these patients are being treated and putting some efforts on those physicians who have more of the types of patients who are going to be DIFICID candidates. Itâs not the entire GI audience but we are getting good data on the subset of GIâs that are involved in CDAD. So watch this space but we are starting to see the results of this effort. 
As I mentioned we saw 10% quarter-over-quarter volume growth. We are up 14% in revenue over Q3 of last year. So itâs very early and nowhere ready to declare victory with DIFICID. But I am just really impressed with the teamâs ability to kind of line this up and have the elements of whatâs needed for success in our site. So look forward to present more as months and quarters roll on.

Thank you. And your next question is come from the line of Stephen Willey.
Stephen Willey - Stifel Nicholas

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the transitions to both of you. Rob I think you had talk about the formulary for many times kind of being a bit of six month process at least for SIVEXTRO and I guess as we think about ceftolozane near going into the early part next year would you be inclined to believe that the review times there maybe a little bit faster just given the fact that there are fewer treatment options in the gram-negative space. 
Robert Perez

I would like to think so Steve but I hate to give you that expectation. There is so many of the institutions itâs just kind of formula they have a certain waiting time period and unless there is something that is really earth shattering they donât change that. We may see hospitals move sooner because we do perceive a greater kind of pent-up or unmet need for gram-negative therapy. So itâs possible that they will break their usual process but you just see that so in frequently in these hospitals, itâs hard to imagine itâs going to happen into many of them. So I think what weâre seeing with SIVEXTRO in terms of pace of formulary approval is likely to be similar to be similar to what we see with ZERBAXA. 
I will say though as I mentioned earlier it is possible for physicians to access these products without formulary and in some institutions frankly whether the products are formulary or not really isnât the major driver of utilization. So there are ways and our people right now with SIVEXTRO in hospitals are giving physicians the ability to access the product even regardless to being on formulary. 
So I think you may see more of that with ZERBAXA, but the formulary process is kind of the formulary process and itâs unlikely that weâre going to be able to significantly change that. 
Stephen Willey - Stifel Nicholas

Okay. And then I think with respect to DIFICID you made a comment about maybe even looking at targeting gastroenterologist outside of the hospital setting and just kind of thinking about the prior BD question just wondering if that something that you would do in conjunction with other BD opportunities in the GI space?
Mike Bonney 

Well, weâre looking at lots of options and ways to access those GIs that matter or DIFICID, again I donât want to give the impression that you have to call in every GI physician in the U.S. itâs a significant subset of that or significantly smaller subset. And weâre going to be open to lots of different solutions.
Stephen Willey - Stifel Nicholas
Okay. And just one housekeeping question for Mike. Could you just remind us if there is a legacy collects the milestone payment related to approval and I know on the slide deck here with respect to R&D guidance does that includes milestone payments without -- include that milestone payment if there is one?
Mike Bonney 

Yes, there is a milestone triggered by regulatory approval, we talked about it before itâs a $25 million milestone from the cash standpoint when given the PDUFA date it doesnât enter in the year from the cash standpoint and from and expense standpoint you remember there is some complexity, the increase in expenses in $25 million but itâs the probably of hitting all future milestones. So it doesnât translate to be exactly the value of the milestone that you cross, does that answer your question?
Stephen Willey - Stifel Nicholas
It does. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko.
Liisa Bayko - JMP Securities LLC

Hi congratulations to both Rob and Mike as well. And I just had one question actually most of mine have been answered, can you just again sort of harp on this, can you just review the components of R&D I know there was a milestone payment in there I believe right to for ZERBAXA and maybe you can then breakdown excluding milestones what the ongoing run rate is. Thanks.
Mike Bonney 

Yes, there is not a significant milestone payment in research and development expense as reported. We talked about the $14 million reversal of prior quarter accruals. We talked about the closeout of the trials but thereâs no milestone impacting that number.
Liisa Bayko - JMP Securities LLC

And for the fourth quarter weâre anticipating if ZERBAXA get approved there will be a 6 million milestones, thatâs include its guidance, right?
Mike Bonney 

The number that guided at $375 million to $400 million worth of R&D expense on top of the 291 already recognized or actually I am missing GAAP to non-GAAP, 375 to 400 total for the year on top of the non-GAAP reported to this year is really -- thatâs the guidance range. That guidance would not include that milestone trigger that consideration expense recognition is non-GAAP.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ram Selvaraju.
Ram Selvaraju - Aegis Capital
Thanks very much for taking my questions and congratulations once again Rob and to you Mike as well. Just with respect to future potential research direction for Cubist, I was wondering whether you could comment on two general topic areas. Firstly, the potential use of biologic such as monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of multi-drug resistance infections and whether might potentially be an area that Cubist could explore in the future particularly when evaluating antibodies that can be isolated from patients who might spontaneously are color from such infections? And then secondly, if youâve taken a look at any of the activities currently going on with respect to the microbiome and if we think that there might be some potential applicability of the research thatâs conducted there in particular in the context of for example gastrointestinal infectious organisms like C. diffs?
Unidentified Company Representative 
Sure, Iâll take that one. First of all on the microbiome absolutely it's an exciting kind of emerging area. I think it's hard to tell where it's going to go and where it's going to succeed, so we are quite active and looking at the microbiome and I would say in terms of biologics approaches we take a very holistic approach, we looked at a number of opportunities, business development opportunities in the non-traditional, if I would call you non-traditional small molecule antibiotics base whether thatâs microbiome or whether thatâs monoclonal antibodies we look quite actively at those obviously we havenât landed one of those quite yet, but thatâs something thatâs certainly in our radar. We do not have a antibody generation group in our building here, but we have a lot of people with immunological experience including myself whoâve worked with Biotherapeutics in the past, we still have a lot of interest in that and we find the right one and thatâs something that weâll target.
