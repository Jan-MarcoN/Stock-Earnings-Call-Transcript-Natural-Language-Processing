Michael Tessler
Thanks, John. Good morning and thank you for taking the time to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. I am happy that we not only delivered strong financials but we further extended our market leadership position and also achieved the strategic objectives that we had previously set forth. 
So I wanted to start by talking about some of our accomplishments from last year. On the financial side, in Q4 2014, revenue was $66 million, up 27% year over year and billings were $84 million, up 17%. This is a significant accomplishment for the entire BroadSoft team and I want to thank them all for their continued focus and performance as they make us the most nimble and innovative company in our industry. 
On the business side, we hit some important end-user adoption milestones. We ended 2014 at over 10 million hosted unified communications suites and over 5 million SIP trunks and [used them] [ph] running on the networks of our service provider partners. We believe that this is a first in the industry and that weâre operating at a scale that far surpasses any of our competitors. 
In 2014, we saw the emergence of service providers embarking on what we call strategic network transformation projects. More and more carriers across the world that made plans to or now in the planning process, are shutting down their legacy TDM networks and migrating to IP. This migration allows service providers to consolidate previously disparate purpose-built networks, reducing costs and complexity and increasing the speed of service delivery. We call this concept build once, use many. 
Our ability to deliver significant financial and operational benefits on our platform has resonated with our customer base and has underpinned many of our network transformational wins. For example, in one project weâre helping the service provider consolidate over 15 different existing products and systems on to a single BroadSoft platform. At another carrier, weâre providing a single solution that will service a diverse set of end customers from SOHO to mid-sized enterprises over both the carrierâs fixed and mobile networks.
I am very pleased to announce that we won another strategic network transformation deal in the fourth quarter. This particular win is very interesting because the underlying network transformation here is not from old legacy TDM to IP but from first generation IP equipment to a BroadSoft enabled IMS-based solution. We believe that we have meaningful competitive advantage in our ability to address this significant TDM to IP and IP to IP transformation opportunities, given our compliance with IMS architectures and our ability to scale and satisfy the diverse requirements of end-users, both big and small. 
There are two key attributes of these projects that make them such attractive wins for us. First is the magnitude of the end user base and resulting addressable market. On a combined basis, there are millions of legacy business centrics [indiscernible] at customers where weâve won these projects. When the TDM network is shut down, all these lines will migrate over to our platform. 
Second is the selected core platform, all new unified communications offerings are expected to be rolled out on our BroadSoft platform. In 2014, we also saw a continued growth of our BroadCloud offering. Weâre now operational in three countries: the US, the United Kingdom and Germany. And during 2014, we added a number of new service providers, including a tier 1 carrier to our platform. 
We ended the year at over 130,000 wholesale unified communications subscribers, up nearly 80% over last year. To us, BroadCloud is a complementary asset to our software business. Whether weâre provisioned by our cloud or software, to the end-user it makes no difference. They can take advantage of our broad unified communications capabilities either way. The service provider makes a choice on how they want these capabilities provisioned based on its own economics and specific requirements. We believe the significant benefit from BroadCloud, including faster time-to-market and lower cost to operate, will drive additional traction for this offering in the marketplace and we continue to make it a focused area of investment and attention. 
Lastly, in 2014 we introduced several solutions tailored to specific vertical industries, including government and hospitality. These vertical solutions are important as a number of industries have specific requirements that other companiesâ vanilla offerings cannot adequately address. Successfully targeting these vertical opportunities takes more than product functionality. It may also require specific product bundling, pricing, packaging and go-to-market efforts. Weâve implemented these measures and believe that by being first to market with the right solutions will create demand and pull from enterprise customers looking for unified communications that work for them. 
Again, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2014 and look forward to continuing our momentum this year. Let me now take some time to briefly discuss our 2015 goals and vision. First and foremost, we will continue our tight partnership with service providers. Our business model continues to be focused on selling to enterprise customers through service providers, by leveraging their sales teams, customer relationships, branding, networks, and complementary products. This is our preferred go-to-market strategy because we believe that carriers in the aggregate have unnatural [ph] asset in terms of global reach, distribution and customer support, and that these will be critical to support and enable the growth of hosted unified communications subscribers this year and into the future. 
To work more closely with service providers and help them succeed, we will continue to invest in our sell-through activities. We've already created several specific assets to differentiate us within our industry. We formed a vertical solutions team, a go-to-market team and a channel acceleration team. These global teams work side-by-side with service providers to create end-to-end processes and apply best in class practices to educate their broad and diverse sales team, present compelling business cases for end-to-end enterprises and address specific vertical needs. 
To achieve our goals in 2015, we are adding more senior sales resources to add addition weight to these efforts. Also, we're empowering these teams to enable our partners to create customized experiences to support their brands and the user experience in their respective local markets. We donât agree with the one-size-fits-all approach and increasing customization of the end-user experience will be an important thing for us this year. 
Our recently announced Leonid acquisition is one part of that effort. Leonid is a developer of software portals and provisioning solutions designed specifically for BroadSoft customers. Weâve had a long-standing relationship with Leonid and recognized the innovation they were able to create as a small highly focused team. These portals are critical to the solution, as they allow end users to self-service and self-administer their products. The portals are easily customizable by different service providers and also easily integrate into enterprises environment. 
We will certainly talk more about customizations as the year progresses. We believe it is a key differentiator for us versus all of our competitors. With the Mobile World Congress Trade Show right around the corner, I want to touch base on our mobile goals. Weâve long been the innovator in the hosted unified communications market when it comes to mobility. For example, we were first to market with the voice over LTE business application server. Weâre also ahead of others in having created solutions with 3G that are seamlessly upgradable to 4G voice over LTE. Going forward, we aim to continue to lead the industry in innovating solutions for all network types, on the 3G, 4G or even WiFi. We also intend to work closely with both service providers and device manufacturers so that we enable an end-to-end mobile user experience unparalleled in our industry. 
On a more strategic level, as the leader of this industry, we will continue to redefine how UC is used within the enterprise and the future of work, by inspiring teams to create, collaborate, and perform in ways never imagined. This means connecting our UC to one [ph] elements with mission-critical systems and business processes within enterprise to manage tasks better, collaborate more effectively and move silos within different parts of the organization. We will drive this new experience centered on mobility first and of course extend to the desktop. 
We believe service providers will deliver this enhanced unified communications experience as the services upsell which allow them to further differentiate their offerings, increasing their brand relevance and drive revenue. 
Finally, I wanted to note a new key addition to the companyâs board. As you may have seen from our press release from a couple weeks ago, Andy Geisse has joined our Board of Directors. Andy was most recently the CEO of AT&T business solutions where he led AT&Tâs efforts for all business customers. He is a proven world-class leader who as a former CIO himself, brings a unique perspective of being able to understand both the needs of the service provider as well as the requirements of end-users. We look forward to benefiting from his knowledge and experience going forward.
Let me close now by introducing to Taher Behbehani, our new Chief Marketing Officer, will be a key executive in driving forward many of our key marketing and customer centric initiatives. Afterwards, Jim will go through our results and guidance and then we will be happy to answer any questions. Taher?
Taher Behbehani
Thanks, Mike and good morning to all of you. I'm very excited to have recently joined BroadSoft. It is amazing what this company has accomplished in the market. In my view, BroadSoft defined and created this industry of hosted communications and it is still leading in this innovation. This is an incredible opportunity for me to leverage my experience. 
I have worked in high-tech companies, start-ups and large corporate brands, including American Express, Time Warner Cable and 3Com. Throughout my career, I have focused on understanding end user needs and addressing them through technology innovation, new business models, distribution channels and partnerships. 
At BroadSoft, I will drive our marketing and brand recognition in a bolder fashion. Expect a more pronounced market presence from us. And underlying all of our messaging and company direction will be three key elements from our new corporate branding: simplify, innovate and accelerate. 
First, simplify. We will continue to make it easier for service providers to implement our solutions and for end-users to take advantage of them. By removing friction at all points, we will grow our market and opportunity. 
Second, innovate. We will invest â we will continue to invest in people and technology to remain the most nimble and forward thinking company in the industry. 
Third, accelerate. We will assist service providers in delivering value-added services that grow their customer base and revenue and in doing so remain as the most reliable trusted partner. It is a pleasure to work with the first class team. 
Thank you, Mike, for the opportunity to talk with our shareholders today and I'll turn the call over to Jim now. Jim?
Jim Tholen
Thanks, Taher. I am very pleased that we were able to close out a strong 2014 with a very strong fourth quarter. 
In Q4, total revenue was $66 million, up 27% from the year ago quarter, and billings, which we define as revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue, were $84 million, up 17% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.64. For the year, revenue was $217 million, up 21% over 2013. Billings were $241 million, up 23% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34. 
In Q4, software license revenue was $35 million, up 27% year-over-year, and software license billings were $37 million, up 13% year-over-year. Our core hosted UC business was once again the key growth engine and sellthrough on hosted remained solid. 
While consumer and trunking were down year-over-year in Q4, we continued to see very good trunking sell-throughs, so believe that it should grow -- show growth in 2015. 
From geographic selling perspective, we saw a year-over-year growth in all regions with the US and Europe especially strong. Our subscription and maintenance support revenue was up 25% year-over-year to $25 million. Maintenance support revenue of $18 million was up 13% year-over-year. 
Cloud SaaS revenue of $7.5 million grew from $4.5 million in the year ago period and from $7 million in Q3. Within our cloud business, we had growth in our core wholesale UC business and a full quarterâs contribution from the acquired STD [ph] business, offset by some decline in our legacy direct to enterprise businesses. 
Professional services and other revenue of $6 million was up 31% year-over-year and billings were $12 million, up from $5 million in the year ago period. The growth that you're seeing here is due in large part to the network transformation projects we've been referring to. Letâs be clear: For us, professional services is not a business that we drive for its [ph] revenue contribution but instead it's a critical enabler to on-board new software customers and projects. 
As we noted before, we believe that there will be significant software orders in time associated with these projects but caution that given their size and scope, several of these are likely to be 2016 and beyond events. 
Now moving on to costs and margins. In Q4, we had gross margin of 81% versus 83% in the year ago quarter and 76% in Q3 of 2014. The sequential improvement in margins was primarily driven by leverage from greater software revenue. On a year-over-year basis, overall margins declined due to revenue mix, with the greater percentage of revenue coming from both cloud and professional services. 
Professional services margins and sales also declined given the investments made in that business to support the greater activity in billing levels. In Q1, I expect cost of sales to be about $1 million from professional services and cloud growth.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $34 million and operating margin was 30%. On a sequential basis, sales and marketing was seasonally up in Q4, driven primarily from commissions given the strong finish to the year. R&D as we previewed was up as we invested to support development, including around the number of large projects. G&A was down as one-time costs in Q3 did not reappear. 
Our expectation for Q1 2015 is that OpEx will grow to approximately $35 million to $36 million. The sequential increase versus Q4 2014 is due to several factors, including expenses associated with the Leonid acquisition and headcount additions across R&D, professional services and sales and marketing. 
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $222 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable of $82 million were up from $60 million in Q3 given the strength in the fourth quarter billings. The strong billings also drove a $19 million sequential increase in deferred revenue to $101 million. 
Net cash from operations was a reported $23 million in the quarter and $55 million for 2014. Iâd note that this number continues to be impacted by tax accounting rules that create some noise around our cash flow. If we exclude the aggregate impact of what are actually non-cash tax accounting driven items, our operating cash flow was a very strong $18 million for the quarter and $61 million for the full year. 
Now on to guidance. As you saw in our earnings release, we expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $52 million to $56 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.13 to $0.21. 
For the year, we expect revenue in the range of $260 million to $268 million and EPS in the range of $1.40 to $1.64. The midpoint of our annual guidance versus the midpoint of our last 2014 guide represents growth of 24% revenue and 20% EPS, which is in line with our commentary from our earnings conference call last November. 
There are several factors driving our expectations. We expect continued growth from our BroadCloud business with total SaaS revenue expected to grow approximately 45% in 2015. Professional services revenue driven by these large transformation projects should grow about 40% to 45%. We also expect a solid software year, driven primarily by contributions from our existing customers, inclusive of the large strategic deals we talked about. 
From a margin standpoint, I think we will end 2015 a bit lower than 2014. As BroadCloud and professional services grow above trend line, we will feel a modest level of gross margin and operating margin compression. Obviously we think the long-term leverage in our business from BroadCloud is very positive and while professional services margins are lower on a relative basis, that work is instrumental and now is [ph] delivering on these very large projects and the expected significant future software growth associated with them.
I would also note that we think we will see increasing gross margins for both BroadCloud and for professional services. So the overall margins we expect really are driven by mix. Iâd note that we also continue to make focused investments in expected [ph] number of areas given our positive view on what market demand will be over the next several years. For example, as we noted with the large strategic deals, major service providers around the world are embarking on significant transformations of their network infrastructure. We also see material long-term opportunity within several verticals, such as government, hospitality and education sectors as they start to move to more fully embrace the cloud. As a result, a number of our investments are in increasing our regionâs footprint which we expect to see a return on over the next couple of years. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. 
Michael Tessler
Thanks, Jim. Jim, Taher and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, can you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. 
George Notter 
I guess I was -- you talked about some of these significant network transformation projects a number of times over the course of the call here. And I know it was a big theme in the Q3 earnings call as well. I guess I want to just go back to â how do you see billings and revenue recognition kind of mapping out over 2015 from some of these projects? And just to be clear the new tier 1 project that you won here in Q4, thatâs incremental to the projects that you were adding during Q3? 
Jim Tholen
Hey George, itâs Jim. I will answer the second question first. Yes, thatâs incremental to the conversations. And just to give a little context, I think we first started talking about some of these larger deals Q4 of 2013 with the Sprint win. And then we've been touching on it each quarter since as we've really seen this trend emerge with some bigger. And so these are large, and Mike likes to call them, construction projects that go on for 12, 18, 24 plus months depending on the carrier in the project. So projects that started in early â14 you have seen evidence of billings certainly -- early â14 youâd see billings in â14, there is some revenue but not proportionately a lot. But you will see revenue for many of those projects in â15. Some of the projects later in â14 and you would see again some billings in â14, billings in â15 but quite possibly not revenue until â16. So they didnât all happen at once, they donât all get delivered at once. We think quite a few number will get recognized during this year and there are certainly some that we expect latter half of the year. 
So it drives guidance but Iâd note a couple things. One, Q4, the impact on Q4 of broadly these large projects with certainly on billings and on revenue comfortably in the 7-figures, particularly on the billing side, one number I would note is the difference in professional services billings versus revenue, I think you can really see the impact of some of these projects there. 
George Notter 
And then I guess I was also just trying to figure out -- can we talk about some of these deal sizes potentially? And if I just sort of play for word and think about how much of the incremental contribution would, letâs say, for example this new project that you guys added here in Q4, is that 7 figures also in terms of its billings and ultimately revenue contribution? I mean how big are some of these projects?
Jim Tholen
Yes, look, I think they're all seven-figure deals. Some are going to be - spend some time on the balance sheet and become revenue. Others where we haven't had to necessarily contractually agree to a set of featured deliverables, look more like the normal turn the crank part of our business, they are just larger but they are all seven figures. Iâd say generally for us these transformation projects -- the lifetime value or the software plus implementation value would be on, several of them, $10 million or more. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair.
Dmitry Netis 
Couple of questions. Again just to piggyback off Georgeâs question. Could you rehash sort of the number of deals, these construction deals that you're working on? I know you mentioned Sprint, and now you mentioned â I donât know if you would consider SaaS still in that category. But there were couple of converged tier 1 wins in Europe. Could you give us the total number of those wins at the moment and essentially name the ones you can?
Jim Tholen
Dmitry, I am not sure we were quite that specific. You're right, there were -- the ones that have been very publicly identified, we announced Sprint, you saw the press release in November from Verizon. There was a large international carrier that you saw the sizeable deferred in Q2. And I think you noted a second international carrier that, again unnamed but there are several â to be honest, several more beyond that.
Dmitry Netis 
And then just another question I guess on the tax implications going forward, when will you begin to pay cash taxes and what that rate might look like?
Jim Tholen
So, for the record, we pay cash taxes now just not in the United States. So I think that the non-GAAP tax rate of 2% should certainly carry us through 2016 and into 2017. So I think 2017 is a bit of a transition year and then 2018 beyond I would use a 20% tax rate on non-GAAP pretax as the tax rate. 
Dmitry Netis 
And then lastly, just sort of â as I look at your offering, I know you are talking about the business SaaS and then UC kind of the main drivers of the business. But there's many different features that make up that solution that you have in the market. Some of them in web conferencing, some of them on contact center, could you, Mike, maybe describe how many projects out there that you lead with those other features and how much of that is instrumental to your winning those deals? I am just sort of trying to gauge your competitive position, not just with UC but some of the other features that are built into the stack vis-Ã -vis some of the offerings out there from your competitors, Microsoft Lync, clearly there as well. So if you could sort of rehash that and help us understand the drivers of the product offering, that will be great.
Michael Tessler
Sure, Dmitry. I will attempt to answer that. I think generally let me start at the highest level. We always lead in the discussions with our carrier customers obviously on the full unified communications stack. The fact that we have kind of everything under one platform, from voice to video to messaging, the clientsâ call center, web conferencing, I mean itâs a very diverse and comprehensive stack. And clearly that's what differentiates us in most discussions with operators because no matter where they start with, whatever segment they would like to start with, they have aspirations of growing into the other segments. So if we start at micro, we might move up to small to medium to very large and/ or vice versa. We also have made investments and have made comments in our remarks about the strength of verticals. So weâve had places where we started with a vertical solution, opening the door, letâs say, for hospitality and then growing our business into other verticals. 
So the fact is we use the full ability to cover all these segments in a pretty comprehensive manner as a pretty strategic competitive weapon against anybody else. And itâs one of the reasons why the carriers -- back to our transformation discussions, the carriers see the opportunity of being able to basically build a single platform and deliver all those segments at a very low cost and very quick service delivery. So our ability to cover all those segments is clearly a strong advantage we have compared to any other competitors. 
Dmitry Netis 
And on the Lync, real quick, Mike, I know you are selling it side by side, your voice engine with their front-end. You see them encroaching on the voice side of the things â 
Michael Tessler
I still think that we need the Microsoft product line as being mostly deployed as adjunct to voice, whether thatâs us or legacy PBXs, it seems like most of the deployments â or a good majority of the deployments are adjunct to voice especially in the enterprise side. So we still feel pretty strong, we have a pretty strong opportunity to kind of sell side-by-side with the desktop solution.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. 
Catharine Trebnick 
Hi, nice quarter; thanks for taking my question. Mine is on BroadCloud. Could you â now weâre in three countries: US, the UK and Germany. How many customers do you now have with the BroadCloud platform and then some more color around the types of end users that are using the platform?
Michael Tessler
Hi Catharine, itâs Mike. So let me just kind of use that â make sure we use the same vocabulary. So we mentioned in the script ending the year at 130,000. I think what we also â I am not sure if youâre asking for customers you mean, end-users or do you mean channels. So let me walk through the whole value chain. What weâre doing in all three markets is weâre signing up more and more channels. Obviously the US market, which is the most experienced market, we have a number of large channels, i.e. large carriers who are using BroadCloud and we're also recruiting and on-boarding lots of smaller resellers, distributors and smaller carriers. So weâre certainly seeing in the US market an interest in BroadCloud from our channels, if you like, or strategic partners across-the-board from very small to very big in North America. Seeing similar trends in Europe where Iâd say in the UK weâre a little further ahead on on-boarding some additional channels and partners and subscriber growth is growing faster and weâre starting, if you like, the recruitment and on boarding the first few in Germany. 
So the way you look at this is, we built to note [ph], we recruit our on-board, our partners and those partners start selling through licensee. So thatâs kind of the way you kind of look at that business. The end users Iâd say primarily are in the mid â letâs say small to mid space. Typically weâre seeing 25 to 100, 150 seats deals, maybe all the way up to 200 seat deals on BroadCloud today except there are few exceptions which are very large. So there is -- but Iâd say generally to answer your question -- most people are launching a small to medium market offer using BroadCloud as the first launch on the cloud offering. 
Catharine Trebnick 
And then this might be more complicated, we can do it on a post call. But are you seeing with the BroadCloud, seems like eight by eight rings central, have a similar plan to go after these smaller partners or original partners to help them drive their cloud business. Are you running end to end, the partners that are also overlapping selling some of their solutions?
Michael Tessler
I mean, we also see. We sometimes some competitors. I think the way weâre compete with differently especially in the operator side since we obviously directly, we are not competing with the channel partners with some case, I think weâve made a comments before, we see some of the operators mixing and matching some BroadWorks deployment with some BroadCloud deployments. So weâre clearly more operator friendly than other players that are really only cloud, really kind of over to pop and really using their brand and just trying to use others for distribution. So we have quite of a different strategy than the others in the market. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt from Raymond James.
Tavis McCourt 
Jim, Iâve got a couple of financial ones and then couple for you, Mike. First on the financials, Jim, what was capital spending spend in Q4 and expectations for 2015? And then as you look at the billings growth for â15 given all the moving parts around the larger deals, what would you expect for billing growth roughly for this coming year?
Jim Tholen
So CapEx for the year was just a smidge over $10 million, if you do the math for Q4 it was about $1.4 million. Iâd expect that on an absolute dollars basis â on an annual absolute dollars basis to be somewhat comparable in â15. While we don't formally guide to billings, itâs a general statement billings and revenue over time correlate pretty tightly. So I expect â15 to be pretty a reasonable billings year as well. 
Tavis McCourt 
And then on the business itself, you put out the press release that you exceeded the 10 million hosted UC lines in the market now. I was just wondering if you could talk about a growth rate of that number -- is it growing in line with the market, better than the market roughly in line and as you compare that to the potential opportunity at the TDM Centrex deals ultimately have to be converted to IP, what is the scale of that opportunity relative to your $10 million embedded base. 
Jim Tholen
Our growth from based on hosted sellthroughs in the 25% zip code and obviously from a much larger base than anyone else in the industry. And from a market opportunity standpoint, we continue to believe that weâre right at the beginning that worldwide less than 5% penetrated and weâre seeing that. Just to net back to the themes on these big transformation deals that, one of the differences here is you're not just a platform for growth with new IP comps but youâre also the platform truly for transformation where you have large numbers of pots business lines and TDM Centrex that will as these networks transform, move on to BroadSoft based platform. So weâre right at the beginning where weâre really pre-transformation right now. 
Tavis McCourt 
Do you have any sense of the amount of TDM Centrex lines in your customer base today? And how many years that would take ultimately those have to be transferred to its IP? 
Jim Tholen
Well, so the typical market data rate has Centrex between 12% and 15% of business lines depending on the geo and certainly in developed economies and we believe most of that is still TDM. So whatâs moved to IP is incremental growth, it hasnât really been the TDM base. 
Tavis McCourt 
If you were to ballpark it, if you think of developed economy market opportunity of 200 million to 300 million lines, somewhere in there, total to 15% of that would roughly be TDM Centrex.
Jim Tholen
Correct. Now the business is a lot bigger than that right. The business opportunity is moving all the premise based PBX business lines plus business pots plus Centrex. But yes, I think the number that we have seen has true TDM Centrex in the 12% and 15% range. 
Tavis McCourt 
But the TDM Centrex has to be moved reasonably quickly I would imagine. Fair assessment?
Michael Tessler
Yes, I mean depends when â each operator is declaring kind of a PSD and shutdown period and depending on that shutdown period, it will get moved along with it. And as Jim was commenting is, itâs a range of legacy products that are â and it depends on the country. So for example, in some European markets weâve got lots of RRI, interconnects and some markets PRI, some markets, business lines, some markets TDM centric. So itâs a basket of all legacy services that we will have to move over.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company.
Rich Valera 
Mike, I was wondering if you could talk about the competitive dynamics of these large transformational deals. Who your competitors are, are they large, traditional telco OEMs, are they smaller companies like yourself? Just give us a sense of what you're competing against when you win these large deals. Thanks. 
Michael Tessler
I am insulted, I mean we are not small. Weâre in 80 plus countries, man. Wow! All right. I think the reality is that the genesis of these discussions typically take place in accounts where we have engaged for a number of years in projects on a particular, for example, particular launch or segment, and what we along with the operators have realized as the business is getting bigger and the need for transitioning or shutting down the PSTN is becoming more imminent, that these dialogue, these discussions weâve had with these operators is one of where they are saying hey, BroadSoft you are already here. You have the capability to cover all of these segments where we don't see any other partner with that dynamic range, which would mean that we have to bring in multiple partners on the application layer and so weâre typically pretty early in on these transformation opportunities. And Iâd say yes, weâre seeing a little bit of competition from the big switch guys but it is not really that that serious because I think that they really struggle, everybody struggles with the ability to cover that many applications. 
Weâre also seeing â we donât talk about it much, but weâre also seeing in smaller op-codes our ability to also cover consumer and obviously our ability to cover fixed transformation and mobile transformation which we actually didnât speak that much about. The fact that we can cover all â if you like all four of those boxes, really puts us in a very unique transformation position in lot of these operators. So I think that we typically get in early, there may be an RFP process. It seems like the ones that weâve won, we won because weâve really been there for a while, understand the operator and really have kind of an insight track on that transformation. And the interesting thing is, which is also -- because weâve already been in, we will actually be migrating some of our existing solutions onto this new purpose built kind of platform in that carrier. So we will actually -- the idea is that that operator will have a single platform that will be able to launch all of the products and services into the marketplace. 
Rich Valera 
Just one follow-up on that. It sounds like most of these deals have some level of customer deliverable in them based on the accumulation of deferred you're seeing. To that end, and I'm assuming you think you have enough resources but it sounds like there's potentially a significant amount of R&D and even op services resources you need to deliver this sort of custom functionality. How much can you leverage that across these different opportunities, is some of that, in fact, something you can move forward on to some of the subsequent transformational deals in the pipeline to sort of leverage it? 
Jim Tholen
Sure, Rich, itâs Jim. So I actually â I caution the word custom, our model is one code based, we just configured differently where they have R&D and professional services demand. On the R&D side, they are more contractual requirements for us to deliver to a set of specifications or -- to deliver features that we would expect to over time anyway but that we are committing to and getting paid for. Certainly as part of these, itâs a broad R&D effort on the specifics of telecom SDN, virtualization. Now we start with huge advantage because weâve actually built a product that way already but just to kind of go to this next generation, we've agreed to a set of deliverables and much of that in â15. 
On professional services side, again itâs less customization but itâs architecture and implementation across these networks and every network is different. And even within major international telcos each of their operating entities can be actually quite different. So that there is intensity to the professional services work there. And from a resource standpoint, absolutely I mean, that's why youâve seen a level of growth in R&D and professional services resource is these projects and I think really kind of a driver for us and even when we announced Q3 giving more color to 2015 because the cosmetics of the year to us were different than expectations, not that we wanted to give color to it, that revenue would grow more because of these projects but at the same time you would see less -- you wouldn't see margin expansion, you would see this level of investment for these really pretty major project wins for us.

Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. 
Vijay Bhagavath 
A question for you in terms of how should we look at your business, in terms of the next few years growth rate? Where I'm coming from is, I think last year you did around low 20-s in terms of topline growth. So, I'd like to understand from a modeling perspective and also from -- how to view the business for the next few years. So would it be low 20s, high teens? Give us a number and the thought process underlying it?
Jim Tholen 
Hey Vijay, itâs Jim. So we haven't â obviously are not guiding beyond â15. I think we think the market opportunity here should have us growing in that ZIP code. I think our goal is long-term to see the business grow at a 20% cliff. But itâs not official guidance for â16 and beyond. 
Vijay Bhagavath 
Thanks, Jim. A quick follow-up. How sensitive or dependent is the business to episodic deals? It's great to hear about the network transformation deals but would it be like a famine or feast scenario that if you do not win some of these episodic deals, that could mess up the next quarter's guidance? We'd like to understand how broad based is demand versus dependent on some of these episodic deals? 
Jim Tholen 
So mostly â itâs a little bit like their question, how would revenue have been without your largest deal, I think the answer is always lower -- is I mean we have over 500 carriers implemented with the software, 10 million lines deployed out there. I think we represent the bulk of the hosted industry and so breadth gives us I think real underlying power on the business. On the increment, these large deals do move the needle but none of them by themselves are so instrumental to the guide that itâs anywhere near a feast or famine. We continue to -- I mean there are years where we don't even have one 10% customer. There are years where we have one 10% customer. So again from a concentration standpoint I think weâre far far away from a feast or famine. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski 
Hi I just had a quick clarification on the guidance and then a couple of questions on BroadCloud. You had earlier thought that the year would be a little more back end loaded. Do you still expect that or do you see it is more of a typical seasonal year?
Jim Tholen 
I guess the answer is â as far as we can tell typical that Q1 looks like a pretty solid quarter from a guide standpoint. We do all our guide bottoms up customer by customer and so theyâre sort of yin and yang or the push and pull on the year is just the timing on some of these larger deals, Simona, but I mean my expectation is that Q1 does tend to be our lowest quarter, Q4 tends to be our largest quarter. And I would expect both those things to be true this year. 
Simona Jankowski 
And on BroadCloud, could you just update us on how big that legacy enterprise pieces in there? Maybe put another way, when would we expect to kind of see the growth in that SaaS business, kind of match with really the underlying growth is as opposed to being dragged down by some of the legacy piece?
Jim Tholen 
So that legacy business -- I think last time we talked about it was 16% of the overall number, it's now below 10%. So itâs becoming less meaningful. As we grow and as that number diminishes. 
Simona Jankowski 
And then just lastly on BroadCloud, some of your early customers on the platform like Verizon, I think were attracted to it partially because of the time to market. Do you see some of those kinds of early customers that have their own scale and capability moving to BroadWorks at some point or do you think that the business model has kind of evolved to a point where once they are on BroadCloud, they will just stay on BroadCloud?
Jim Tholen 
I think itâs an interesting question, Simona, and part of the attraction to carriers of going with us is â there is that kind of endgame flexibility to move to software. And I guess my comment there, and Mike, chime in, is we will see that â at some level the carriers are certainly capable of moving these in-house as software and then we get a pretty nice looking software order but of course you would see a possible impact on the cloud growth number. Current course and speed, we certainly see the focus from the carriers that are on cloud, driving that cloud business. 
Michael Tessler
No, I agree that. I think weâre certainly seeing some of the operators looking at mixing and matching, starting with cloud for a segment leaving it there, going to other segments. So I think I agree with Jim is that itâs been a little bit of a wait and see game, to see what happens. But I think that weâre likely see a good solid growth and frankly weâre still very early in marketing BroadCloud in a number of geos. So weâre still very early in the curve in, for example, Europe. Weâre early in distribution in the US. Weâre just really -- as you noted, we started with a couple of very large key customers on cloud. Weâre now expanding that distribution. So I think weâre going to see a mixture. 
Weâre also seeing, on the flip side, weâre seeing again small data points, weâre seeing some operators go from software to cloud, realizing that cost and complexity of running the platform that we can actually do it more efficiently. So I think I have made this comment at the analyst day, we had, weâre still going to be in a little bit of wait-and-see game to see how all that kind of flushes out. 
Operator
Our next question comes from [Sabu Saframin].
Unidentified Analyst
I had two questions. First is on, from a mix perspective you talked about the 40% sort of growth opportunity in BroadCloud and professional services, and you could do the back of the envelope, but if you could just talk about how youâre thinking about license revenue growth for this year and are there any large revenue recognition events that we should be aware of? The other one is on business royalty, start talking about how many of these network transformation deals are driven by business royalty or have a business royalty component and things we should look forward to at Mobile World next week from kind of an industry perspective, and your perspective, that would be helpful?
Jim Tholen
So I think if you do the math on the guide you come up with software a little bit south of 20%. The underlying assumption there is that consumer continues to diminish, we would see some growth in trunking but below trend line and then hosted would be above that overall number. And then hosted including cloud obviously is weâd be comfortable in the 20s. 
Michael Tessler
Let me â I will take the question around the voice over LTE. I think the answer is that we are clearly -- our ability to integrate our network transformation platforms on a wide variety of networks including voice over LTE, including Wi-Fi, including 3G, and IMS and NGN standards and IMS from every other vendor, that ability for us to intermediate all of those networks and offer the carriers the ability to target a very rich set of applications is the reason for the advantage. So I mean clearly VoLTE is a component of that network transformation, skill set and advantage but it really comes along with our ability to integrate with almost any network out there underlying network and for us to kind of intermediate those networks and creating single very strong application platform for the operators. So that's kind of how that voice over LTE is stuffed into that.
Unidentified Analyst
And do you expect to have any specifically VoLTE related revenues in 2015, how should we think about the revenue contribution from VoLTE? 
Jim Tholen
Yes, so broadly we will have dollar millions in transformation project in revenue in â15 and VoLTE in particular, yes, in fact Iâd say that it's definitely in millions. 
Unidentified Analyst
When you talked about consumer opportunity diminished trunking and trendline, can you just talk about what those represent as a percent of revenue, whereâs the level, or down two versus the hosted as a percent of revenue?
Jim Tholen
So consumer ended in â14 in the 5% ZIP code, I think that it'll â it sounds like more to diminish but it will diminish from there and trunking I think is going to be in the 15% or perhaps a bit lower than that overall revenues. So weâre increasingly â it was all hosted although obviously hosted is a pretty wide trunk. 
Operator
Our next question is a follow up from George Notter from Jefferies.
George Notter
Thanks for letting me squeeze one in here. I guess I wanted to ask about sort of incumbent telcos views on hosted services and I guess I am wondering just how proactively they are selling these services? If I go back itâs clear that these types of services cannibalized TDM and ISDN types of revenue streams for those guys, and historically incumbents have focused more on selling hosted into outer region situations or situations where they are going to lose an enterprise customer any way, but how do you feel about where the market is now in terms of really proactively selling these services, are we hitting a tipping point where these guys are getting after it or is it still more defensive?
Michael Tessler
Sure George. I think the reality that though, I guess the network is going to be shut down and in many cases the operators, I have made somewhat public declarations of those dates, puts a lot of pressure on the business units to move very large revenue bases from those legacy products onto new products before competitors. So I think weâre seeing the incumbents using that word, becoming a little bit more and increasingly more aggressive in the overall unified communications space. I think the experience theyâve had to date gives them confidence that they can operationalize it, run it, sell it and now they're looking at how to really migrate very large legacy revenue bases on to it and also get more aggressive on selling it. 
I think generally the reason, the other thing I would say that the interesting part of the transformation equation is that the operators and we believe this too, is that what we want to do is drive the overall cost per unit, cost per user down, the monthly cost per user down. So there's more earnings in it obviously for the operators and again make it more interesting for them to get more aggressive in selling it. So a platform approach where they are able to offer small medium large verticals, all off a very common platform leveraging fairly large obviously network builds in LTE and Wi-Fi really is why I think weâre seeing this really interesting set of network transformation projects around the business side of the operators coming to us. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein from Cowen. 
Paul Silverstein 
First, I apologize, I recognize some of this has been asked in other forums. How much of these network transformation projects are incremental to the historical flow of the business? And also putting aside quarterly volatility and the exact timing of revenue recognition, as we look out to 2016, beyond 2015 it sounds like -- am I right, that it sounds like many of these recent wins arenât going to â still weâre not going to see it [ph] in a meaningful way until 2016, and the last question along those lines is beyond the wins youâve already spoken about, how many opportunities are you currently pursuing under this roof of network transformation, how many to go? If I recall, you are in the 19 of the top 25 carriers in the world. It sounds like almost all of these are from the existing customer base, as one would expect? And then Iâve got a follow up on BroadCloud if I may. Why donât I let you respond to the questions on the current transformation opportunities?
Jim Tholen
Paul, I will try. Is that Part A? Let me try. Number one, sub-part B.2 â so one, I view these deals as not really at some level different than incremental. We've always â weâre in these networks, weâre working with these carriers. Itâs the transformation as they are moving from thinking about IP as kind of a new growth opportunity to actually moving and moving hundreds of thousands or millions of lines on the geo. So it's a hard question, Iâd sort of say how incremental to the normal business or if you didn't have these, what would the normal business be or any of those permutations, I think itâs something weâve been waiting to see happen but is part of the market evolution, weâre just I think in an enviable position to take advantage of it as the market moves from kind of -- it's smaller part of the overall market, or bigger market opportunity. 
As we said earlier, as Mike likes to say these are all construction projects. When we first started talking about it was Q3 of â14 â âQ4 of â13 and so I think some of the earlier projects you saw billings in â14 and some revenue, you'll see certainly millions of dollars in revenue and billings in â15. And then certainly that grows pretty substantively in â16. Some of the projects that we talk about later this year and a couple of larger projects we noted including the international carrier Q2 of â14 will be â16 revenue. So it depends â some of these are really pretty major operating companies in major geos. So that one we expect itâd be in 2016 and I would say that weâre very early on this, most incumbent carriers and by the way mobile carriers, converged carriers are all going to go through their versions of these business transformations as they move from TDM or old IP to IP. I mean just VoLTE in a lot of ways by its very nature is TDM to IP transformation. So Mike, I donât know if you â
Michael Tessler
Paul, I apologize but if we could take your BroadCloud question off-line, weâre already running late, So I must do end the call now. 
Paul Silverstein 
Hey John. If I may, just on the network transformation deals, on the number of opportunities that are beyond the ones weâve already won. 
John Kiang
I think itâs a healthy pipeline.
