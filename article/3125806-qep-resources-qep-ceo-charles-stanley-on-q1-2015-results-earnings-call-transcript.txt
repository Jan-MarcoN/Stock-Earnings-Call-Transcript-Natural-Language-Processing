Greetings, and welcome to the QEP Resources First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
William I. Kent
Thank you, Stacey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business. If you've not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our Earnings Release, which contains tables with our financial results and the slide presentation, which contains maps and other supporting materials. In today's conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings. In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risk factors facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard J. Doleshek
Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly give you some color about our first quarter financial results and updated guidance for 2015, and then turn the call over to Chuck. In a nutshell, it was all about lower commodity prices in the first quarter. We realized lower prices for our production, and we slowed down activity because of lower prices. As you recall, during our February conference call, we suggested that production in the first quarter would decline from the fourth quarter of 2014, and then plateau for the remainder of 2015, and that's what's happening. Oil production combines the lowest crude oil NGL prices that we have received since we became a stand-alone public company, resulted in first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $223 million compared to $366 million of adjusted EBITDA generated from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2014, and $333 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Production in the first quarter was 75.2 Bcfe or 10.7 Bcfe lower than the record 85.9 Bcfe we reported in the fourth quarter of 2014. Oil volumes were 4.5 million barrels, down 700,000 barrels levels from the fourth quarter levels, and NGL volumes were down 947,000 barrels, down 800,000 barrels from the fourth quarter. Natural gas volumes were 42.6 Bcf, down only 4% from the fourth quarter. Crude oil comprised 36% of our total production in the first quarter, which is the same as the contribution in the fourth quarter of 2014. Factors contributing to the oil decline were mainly company controlled and Chuck will elaborate on how we are managing drilling and completion activities in the current price environment.
The large decline in NGL volumes results in switching over to ethane rejection in the first quarter compared to the ethane recovery in the fourth quarter. The modest decline in natural gas production from the fourth quarter was driven by better performance from our improved completion design of Pinedale and the contribution from our horizontal Lower Mesaverde well that we talked about in the press release yesterday. Our updated oil production guidance for 2015 is a range of 17 million to 18.5 million barrels, the midpoint of which is up 0.25 million barrels from our initial guidance midpoint. Our updated guidance for NGL volumes is 4 million to 4.3 million barrels. The lower to upper end of the NGL range reflects slightly lower NGL recoveries using refrigeration processing rather than cryogenic processing. Our updated guidance for natural gas production is 165 to 175 Bcf, the midpoint of which is 5 Bcf higher than our initial guidance, reflecting better well performance at Pinedale and Uinta basin. QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price, which include the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $5.61 per Mcfe, which was $1.51 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the fourth quarter of 2014, and $1.73 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the first quarter of 2014. The weighted average fuel level equivalent price in the quarter was $4.25 per Mcfe, which was 32% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014.
The equivalent price reflects fuel level crude oil prices that were $39.89 per barrel, fuel level NGL prices that were $20.09 per barrel, and fuel level natural gas prices that were $2.87 per Mcf. Fuel level crude oil revenues account for 56% of total fuel level revenues, which was 5% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. Derivative settlements added $102 million or $1.36 per Mcfe to QEP Energy's net price realizations. QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $129 million from the quarter, down from $143 million from the fourth quarter of 2014 and up from $121 million in the first quarter of 2014.
On a per unit basis, LOE was $0.83 per Mcfe, which was up $0.09 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter, and transportation expense was $0.90 per Mcfe, which was down $0.03 from the fourth quarter. Our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses is unchanged at $1.70 to $1.85 per Mcfe for full year 2015. G&A expenses were $47.4 million, which was down $10 million from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower expenses such as the annual employee incentive plan. We did incur about $2.3 million in severance expenses associated with some restructuring that occurred in the quarter. Our guidance for G&A expenses is $170 million to $185 million for full year 2015.
In the first quarter, we generated a net loss of $55.6 million. In addition to lower production and commodity prices, 3 noncash items negatively impacted net income. We recorded losses on asset sales of about $30.5 million, primarily related to unresolved title issues on some of the properties in last summer's mid-continent sale. We also recorded impairments to proved and unproved properties of $20 million driven by lower forward natural gas prices. And finally, as a result of the forward crude oil prices strengthening at the end of the quarter, the value of the crude oil derivatives portfolio was lower than at year-end, resulting in a $23.5 million unrealized loss. Capital expenditures on an accrual basis for E&P drilling completion activities was $280 million for the quarter. As Chuck will describe in a moment, we forecast our capital expenditures to continue to decline with rig count and are forecast the midpoint for 2015 capital spending to be $975 million, which is unchanged from our initial guidance.
With regard to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $8.5 billion. Shareholder equity was about $4 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.2 billion, all of which were our senior notes, and we have $0.5 billion of cash in the bank. In March, we sent $510 million to the IRS, $480 million of which was related to the $2.5 billion sale of the midstream business and $30 million of which was related to the SCOOP sale that closed at year-end. Recall that we expect to call back as much as 30% of that tax bill from the midstream sale next year, as we generate and carry back tax losses from IDC expense.
I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles B. Stanley
Thanks. Good morning. Since Richard has already discussed our first quarter operational and financial results, I'll spend a few minutes updating you on our plans for 2015, then I'll quickly review each of our core areas to share some recent operational highlights before moving on to the Q&A.
As we described at our year-end call, we've responded to the decline in crude oil and natural gas prices by dramatically reducing activity across our asset portfolio. While our balance sheet's strong, we do not think it's prudent to consume our liquidity or our inventory to drive production growth at current commodity price levels. Instead, we remain focused on living within our means. We've cut our operated drilling fleet from a high of 21 rigs in the third quarter of last year to 11 at the end of the first quarter, and we are down to 8 operated rigs today. We're only drilling wells that meet our internal rate of return criteria using current cost and forward strip prices, and excluding the impact of our oil and gas price derivative portfolio. We've seen significant price concessions from service providers and material suppliers, but if any of them are listening in, we believe there's still room for more improvement. We also continue to work on optimizing our well completion scheduled to position ourselves to take advantage of the contango in a forward curve and for our return to production growth when prices recover. Now let me provide some color on our recent operational results by area, and as I do so, you can refer to the slide presentation that accompanied our earnings release yesterday and was posted on our website.
In the Williston Basin, we had 4 QEP-operated rigs running at the end of the first quarter, 3 in South Antelope and 1 on the Fort Berthold Reservation. Williston Basin net production averaged approximately 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, and that was 89% liquids during the first quarter and that's a 13% decrease over the fourth quarter 2014 but a 51% improvement over the first quarter of last year. This sequential quarterly decline was driven in part by a deliberate slowdown in our completion activity in response to lower prices, and in part due to a significant amount of shut-ins during the first quarter for offset completion activity. We completed and turned to sale 16 gross operated wells during the quarter, with an average working interest of 80%, 9 of those were on South Antelope and 7 were on Fort Berthold. We also participated in 22 gross outside-operated Bakken/Three Forks wells that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter, with an average working interest of about 8%.
We continue to be extremely pleased with the results from our new well completion design in Williston Basin. On our South Antelope acreage, we made the switch in the middle of last year from pumping 300 to 400 pounds of proppant per lateral foot to 750 to 900 pounds of proppant per lateral foot, while we kept the stage count constant at about 33 stages. And we saw a dramatic improvement in well performance just from the increase in proppant volumes. On more recent wells, we began pumping approximately 1,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot over 50 stages, which led to an even greater improvement in well performance. We shared the comparative cumulative production data with you on Slide 7. As you can see, the results are quite remarkable, comparing performance from the 2 families of new completion designs, increasing the profit volume but keeping the stage count constant at roughly 33 stages resulted in an average increase in cumulative production of about 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 120 days online.
Combining larger proppant volumes that is about 1,000 pounds per foot, with more stages, on average about 50, that resulted in an even -- in an average increase in cumulative production of about 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 120 days online compared to our original completion design. That's an improvement of about 85%, resulting in an average cumulative production of over 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent during the first 120 days of an average well being online.
Also note that when you study the graph, you will see that the performance of both families of enhanced completions continues to diverge positively from the performance of the original completion design in the later time periods. We expect, as that divergence would indicate, we expect an increase in estimated ultimate recovery for these new wells or the new completion design, but obviously, it won't be proportional to the large, i.e., 85% improvement that we've seen in the early life performance. We've also pumped this new completion design in wells that we've recently completed on Fort Berthold. And while early production performance has been encouraging, we just don't have enough samples and we don't have enough production history on the Fort Berthold wells to draw empirical conclusions at this time. Data analyzed to date indicate that the large profit volumes pumped over a lot of stages, 50 plus stages, will be key to the successful high-density infill well performance at both South Antelope and Fort Berthold.
We believe that these enhanced completion design results will drive a more complex fracture network that in turn should lead to a higher percentage recovery of the original oil in place. We continue to evaluate the potential for infill development at South Antelope and we've recently begun flowing back a family of pilot wells. This group of wells will evaluate both 400 and 600 foot infill well spacing, and it will also test an additional bench -- the second bench in the Three Forks. The outcome of this pilot program will not only help quantify additional development inventory associated with increased density drilling, but it also will help evaluate potential for deeper development of Three Forks' benches. While the early results are positive, it will take at least 90 days of production history to draw any meaningful conclusions from the initial high density pilot, so we should have some early results to discuss with you on our second quarter call.
Slide 8 provides additional details on the geometry of infill pilot program on South Antelope. This year, we're planning to invest about half of our capital budget in the Williston Basin, and we plan to operate 2 to 3 horizontal rigs in this play.
Now let me turn to the Permian Basin. Daily production during the first quarter averaged 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day that was about 85% liquids. As we mentioned during our year-end call, Permian Basin operations were adversely impacted by severe weather early this year. Both our production and completion operations were impacted, mostly during the first couple of weeks of January, which had a negative impact on first quarter production volumes. Permian gas and NGL volumes have also been impacted by chronic third-party gas processing plant outages that started in early -- with the earlier storms, and those outages have continued intermittently through the quarter.
During the first quarter, we completed and turned to sale 7 vertical and 4 horizontal QEP-operated wells in the Permian, 3 horizontal operated wells comprised of 1 Wolfcamp B and 2 Wolfcamp D wells at an average maximum daily production rate of 1,021 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a maximum average 30-day production rate of 200 -- of 711 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The fourth horizontal well, which was targeting a Wolfcamp B interval is still in the early stages of clean-up. We had 3 operated rigs active in the Permian Basin at the end of the quarter, 1 drilling vertical Atokaberry wells and 2 drilling horizontal targets in the Spraberry Shale and Wolfcamp D. As of today, we're operating 2 rigs in the Permian, both drilling horizontal wells. We currently plan to invest about 21% of our capital budget in the Permian Basin in 2015, and slides 10 and 11 provide more details on our Permian properties.
Moving onto Pinedale. At the end of the first quarter, we had 3 rigs operating on our acreage. During the quarter, we completed and turned to sales 20 gross wells, including 1 well in which we have only a small overriding interest. During the first quarter of 2014, Pinedale net production averaged 242 million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day, and that's roughly 13% liquids. Pinedale production, as a reminder, always declined sequentially from the fourth quarter levels due to our delivered suspension of well completion activities during the coldest months of winter.
In January, we began rejecting ethane from Pinedale production, and given the current price environment, our guidance anticipates that we will inject (sic) [ reject ] ethane for all of 2015. Just a reminder that this decision to reject ethane results in a 7% to 8% reduction in natural gas equivalent volumes compared to the volumes when we recover ethane. As we mentioned on our year-end call, we see very encouraging results from a new Pinedale completion design that we tested on 16 wells last year and we continue to apply it all on the Pinedale completions this year. The new design has resulted in an average of 115 million cubic feet a day equivalent of increased 90-day cumulative production volumes compared to our old design, and that's a 50% increase. And since the new design is simply a change in proppant size, it doesn't cost any more than the old design, so it's quite economic. You can see the actual results on Slide 13. We plan to invest about 19% of our capital budget in 2015 at Pinedale.
Turning to Uinta Basin. Uinta Basin, net production averaged 77 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. That's about 29% liquids during the first quarter, and 44 million cubic feet equivalent was comprised of about 18% liquids, came from our Lower Mesaverde play. Like Pinedale, we also began rejecting ethane in the Uinta Basin in January, and we'll anticipate and our guidance anticipates ethane rejection throughout the year. At the end of the first quarter, we had 1 operated drilling rig working in the Lower Mesaverde play.
During the quarter, we completed and turned to sales our 6 Lower Mesaverde horizontal well. This latest well incorporates the cumulative knowledge that we've gained from the first 5 horizontal wells that we drilled in this play, and the result, I have to say, are quite exciting. We've made significant progress on the well construction front with major improvements in drill times. The most recent horizontal well reached total depth in 31.4 days, and our drilling progress averaged slightly over 500 feet per day compared to an average of about 275 feet per day on the 5 earlier wells. More importantly, we've continued to improve our completion design, and in this well, we nearly tripled the proppant loading per lateral foot compared to the earlier wells. The result is a well that was drilled and completed for about $9.6 million and that has reduced almost 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent in ethane rejection mode during the first 80 days online.
We continue to believe that this Lower Mesaverde play has Pinedale-like potential, and this latest well is a major step on the path of economically developing this multi-TCF resource. We expect to operate 1 rig during part of 2015, a new innovation, and the play will attract about 3% of our total capital budget this year. Slides 14 and 15 provide additional details on the Lower Mesaverde property in the Uinta Basin. We continue to make substantial headway on improving the return from our existing assets in the current commodity price environment by enhancing completion designs and by our relentless focus on driving down cost. We've also aggressively been pursuing opportunities to boost the inventory depth of our existing asset base through high-density infill development at Williston, through continued delineation of our Permian properties, including delineation of the Spraberry potential, and we are making great progress unlocking the tremendous potential of our Uinta Basin asset, as evidenced by the performance of our most recent Mesaverde well. Tactically, we continue to believe that reigning in the capital investment and slowing growth, preserving the liquidity will allow QEP to successfully navigate through the current commodity price cycle, and for us to emerge on the other side, well positioned for the future. We work diligently to transform QEP into a more focused and balanced E&P company, with a deep-cut portfolio of high return investment opportunities, capable of delivering superior returns in a variety market conditions. We remained focused on improving the quality of our portfolio by continued innovation, superior execution and our relentless focus on driving down costs. Our success will position QEP not only to survive the current downturn but to emerge from it in a position of strength. With that, Stacey, let's open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Corales with Howard Weil.
Brian M. Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
I've got a couple on the Bakken here. The $9.5 million blended well cost, can you maybe talk about what the recent wells, with the enhanced completions or more stages, what those cost versus the original well?
Charles B. Stanley
Sure, Brian. The $9.5 million as a blended well cost, it's between South Antelope and Fort Berthold. The wells on Fort Berthold cost just a bit more. We have more road and pad construction costs. We also have additional fees we pay to the tribe for activity on the reservation, and those are really about $9.5 million. Some of them are a little more. I'm looking at Jim, slightly more than $9.5 million, with -- on average, they're about $9.5 million. The South Antelope wells are closer to $9 million, and that's using the increased proppant loading, 50 stages, sliding sleeve completions that we -- we kind of blend sliding sleeve, some plug-in per mixture, both of those, South Antelope and Fort Berthold, that's how we end up with an average of $9.5 million for our plants. If we look on a same-store basis, if we take at $9 million South Antelope well using today's design, 10 million pounds of proppant, 1,000 pounds per lateral foot, sliding sleeve technology with 50-ish stages, $9 million today, that well, with the lower proppant volume, with the same stage count, would have been -- if we subtract out the profit volume, go back to 33 stages, that would be roughly $7.5 million to $8 million completed well cost. So we go back to the original design, the old design, today, with today's well, lower service cost, that would be a $7.5 million to $8 million well. Does that make sense?
Brian M. Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Yes, that's helpful. And then, I mean, you have a big backlog now. When do you start kind of working through that. Does that, I mean, where the strip is today, I mean, does it start looking attractive?
Charles B. Stanley
It looks better than it did a few weeks ago. I mean, we're still looking at a $63, $64 2015 -- I'm sorry, 2016 crude oil price. We're seeing some strengthening in the back end of the curve. We continue to watch it, and we'll make the decision around resuming completion activity and driving production growth as we see the back end continue to strengthen.
Brian M. Corales - Scotia Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And one more on the Uinta. I mean, that's a good well. Was it just more proppant used you think contribute to this, or do you think, I mean, look at the map that this was on the eastern side, do you think the eastern is better than the western? Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that?
Charles B. Stanley
We used 3x more proppant per foot on this well than any of the previous wells. So we think, just like everywhere else that we have applied the simple technology, adding volume, it seems to impact early time well performance, and we think, ultimately, it will impact recovery. We've gone back to drilling shorter laterals. This well was about a 6,800-foot lateral. So it's -- we think we can more adequately stimulate the length of the lateral in a shorter lateral than a longer lateral, that's the second point. The third point is, we've changed that from plug and perf to sliding sleeve because we really have been concerned about the residence time of frac fluid on the formation. So by using sliding sleeves, we're able to basically stop pumping the frac job and immediately start flowing the well back. And we think the quicker that you can get the fluid off of the formation, the less imbibement of water there is into the rock, and therefore, the better the well performance. And we see that even through the early time flow back because we start making gas almost instantly compared to having to wait around for several weeks to see first gas production. As far as geology and geography is concerned, the Neslen [ph] section, which is where all our horizontal wells have been drilled today, there's a continuous interval. I guess they're a little deeper on the western side, but when we look at productivity per lateral foot, when we get good wells, we get good stimulation of the lateral interval. We don't think that there's a material difference from the western part of our acreage to the eastern part of the acreage.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
The improved performance that you highlighted here in Pinedale, perhaps, harkens back to a time a decade ago when you saw those types of improvements, maybe for slightly different reasons in the field. Can you just talk more specifically about what you're doing on a completion front. Is it kind of what you've been talking about in the Bakken with just putting more proppant volumes in, whether you see EURs and recovery rate rising, and how that impacts your thoughts on your rig count plans in the region, relative to various natural gas price environments?
Charles B. Stanley
Sure, Brian. It's not the same story, actually. We're just changing proppant size. We may be pumping a slightly larger job, but we've gone to a 100 mesh proppant, basically, very fine sand. And we believe that what we're able to do with the smaller-grain proppant has created much more complex fracture network, which is allowing us to access more of the rock and more adequately drain it. As far as estimated ultimate recovery performance, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's very similar comment to the comment that I made about the Williston. We see a 50% improvement in early time performance. We don't think that translates into a 50% improvement in EUR, but it certainly should improve EUR on the wells. We need a longer time history before we can draw meaningful conclusions. I would say, by the end of this year, we'll have some wells that will be online for 450 days, 400 days, and at that point, we'll be comfortable forecasting or more comfortable forecasting reserves on them. We're in the part of the field, Brian, which we call Steward Point[ph] , which is the home to the largest wells in the entire Pinedale Anticline. There are some 20-plus Bcf wells in the northern part of our acreage. So in general, we expect better well performance in the North, but what we're doing is comparing these new completions to immediate offset wells that were completed using the coarser-grain profit. Similar stage count, similar fluid, similar volumes of proppant per stage. So it's really primarily a fracture complexity story. We've been innovators and leaders in Pinedale since the early 2000s, driving down well cost, moving to pad development, moving to directional wells with, in some instances, 30 to 40 wells per pad, which is enhanced economics from the beginning. And we set the curve on drill times and on completion technology, including 24-hour completions, et cetera. So this is just another step in an evolution of continuous improvement at Pinedale as QEP has led the way to improve recoveries and drive down costs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. And then, my follow-up is, when you think about the Bakken and Permian, how important to QEP is additional scale in those regions? And to what degree do you need, want or see opportunities to bolster your acreage positions in one or both?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, obviously, one of our strategies, Brian, has been to build contiguous acreage positions, as we think, obviously, resource plays demand manufacturing mentality. We invented and perfected a lot of manufacturing technologies that are now being used not only across our acreage, but across the industry for pad drilling and pad development. So contiguous acreage is important. We'd look for opportunities to trade, bolt-on, increment our acreage, not only in the Williston, but in the Permian. Obviously, asset deals in this environment are tough. The sellers don't -- sellers remember valuations from the second quarter of last year. Buyers point to the current forward curve, and there's a huge bid/ask spread. But as time goes on and some deals get done, for various reasons, we think there will be opportunities. So we continue to look for opportunities to bolt-on to our existing asset base to broaden and strengthen it. In the meantime, the things that I talked about in our prepared remarks are absolutely important and have the potential to add inventory on our existing acreage. A, infill drilling in the Williston. We're very encouraged by the early flowback data. We need more time to really fully evaluate what the performance of the infill wells would be, but early time data gives us encouragement. Two, one of the wells we've drilled in this first pilot program was the second bench well. That well looks good in early performance, so it has the ability to prove up additional potential that we are carrying even in our resource potential in the Williston for the deeper benches. It's applicable to South Antelope. It may be applicable to parts of the Fort Berthold position, but we don't know that yet for sure. We're drilling our third bench well, that will be coming online later this year and adds another layer and another target within our existing leasehold that we are excited about. The Uinta Basin, Mesaverde well is huge because we think that the resource potential in the Uinta Basin is significant and is Pinedale-like, and there's resource potential. There are multiple horizontal targets. We focused on one, the lower Neslen [ph] today, but there are other intervals that called out in our slide deck, in the last slide, that show additional horizontal potential across our acreage. One of the challenges in the Uinta has been driving down well cost, and we think we've made significant progress with bid selection. Where we land the horizontal laterals, i.e., we're not trying to drill in the sands now, we're trying to actually drill in shales and silts, which have improved or nearly doubled our rate of penetration, and then, perfecting our completion design. So in the case of the Uinta Basin, bigger fracs, shorter lateral, so that we more fully stimulate the interval that we drill. Those 2 things together, along with sliding sleeve technology to get the water off fast, seem to have made a huge difference in early time well performance. These wells are conservatively 12 Bs. They may be as much as 15 or 16 Bs, we just don't know yet. They exhibit relatively flat, flattish declines compared to the old Haynesville wells that we've drilled that dropped off precipitously after IP. So we're very excited about this play. We think it has a potential to be competitive with other tight gas plays around the country, including some in the Northeast.

Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
You mentioned and gave a good detail on the rigs and kind of what you're at today. I guess, my question around that is, you mentioned kind of an IR criterion, what you would have to have. How does that change today? And obviously, with the rebound we've seen in oil, just your thoughts on the criteria going forward and kind of what would make you go back to at least that first quarter level?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, we have a decent inventory of wells that are drilled and uncompleted that we built up when we were running at a much higher rig count. Well oil has rebounded from the low that we saw in the first quarter and in the prop months. The forward curve is still pretty weak, in my opinion. I mean, if you look across, it's-- we're about $61 for the remainder of this year, and it gets up to $66.50 or so in 2019. So in our mind, we still think there's opportunities to drive down costs, and we think there's opportunities to embed those cost in our future development plans. So we're not in a big hurry to pick up additional rigs just because we see a $4 or $5 pop in the front months of the forward curve. We think that there's-- either needs to be 1 or 2 things that happen, either it needs to be continued structural change in the cost side or needs to be a structural change in the forward curve to drive robust economics in most of these plays. And I would point out that assets like our Williston Basin, South Antelope asset are some of the best in the unconventional oil space, and I think, we're seeing some of the best economics in the current pricing cost environment that are out there. And we're not anxious to drive huge growth at these prices.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
That makes sense. And if I could, you mentioned the Williston Basin. I agree with you on your acreage there. A question, when you look at the South Antelope versus the Fort Berthold there, do you anticipate getting sort of similar optimizations or similar uplift, I should say, from the optimizations that you're doing in both plays?
Charles B. Stanley
It's too early to tell, as I've said. We pump some big frac jobs, the high volume, or high profit volume frac jobs at Fort Berthold. We certainly see an increase in initial well performance. Ironically, the best rock responds the best. So on a barrels of oil equivalent cumulative production basis, you get more incremental production out of the best rock, and South Antelope, as you recall from early on when we talked about the acquisition and people scratched their heads about why we bought it, we told people that we had identified it as some of the best rock in the basin, and it is. The performance of these large fracs are -- is directly related to the amount of oil in place, so the size of the price is greatest there. And so the ability to increment recoveries there results in significant, as you've seen in the early 120-day performance, significant uplift in well performance. The size of the prize isn't quite as big on the Fort Berthold. It's still one of the better areas in the basin. But on an absolute basis, we wouldn't expect to see the same uplift because the rock's just not as good, there's not as much oil in place and therefore, the incremental results. Maybe on a percentage basis, it will be as big, but on an absolute basis, they won't be. But even on a percentage basis, because the rock is tighter, it's probably not going to be technically possible to get the same percentage improvement out of our Fort Berthold well. We don't know that yet. That's what we would anticipate based on studying the whole basin and looking at the oil in place and other factors that drive this well performance.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Sure, it makes sense. And then -- shifting to one here, over in the Perm. Just, I don't know if you hear it yet, just on, what are you seeing today on current well cost, and maybe, if I could even have that a bit more detail. We're just looking at the cost per interval when I look at the Wolfcamp B versus the D. How does that -- is that pretty similar? Or so I guess, kind of 2 questions around it, just sort of general cost overall, and then, as you're attacking some of the different formation, how are you seeing sort of the cost per interval vary?
Charles B. Stanley
There's 2 things that go on in the Permian that make it a bit different. One, depending on the geometry of our acreage, we drill different length laterals. So if I just talk about, basically, 7,500-foot laterals between the Wolfcamp B and the Wolfcamp D, there are 10.25 to -- $10.25 million completed well cost, and those are basically the supersize fracs that we're doing in 2,000 pounds per foot. So they're even double what we're pumping in the Williston. So we're doing plug and perf there. But I will tell you at the outset that I still think we're in the lower part of the learning curve on drilling and completions in the Permian. And as I think I've said in previous calls, it was an area that -- as we moved into new areas, whether it would be the Haynesville back in 2006, 2007 time frame, the Williston in '08, '09, the Permian today, the areas with the highest level of activity and the most growth in rig count over a short period of time have been the least efficient, and it takes a while to perfect and drive down our well cost, and we're still in the early innings there. The wells practically shouldn't cost as much as they do, but just based on the activity level in the Permian they do. And that's an area where we're focused on, trying to drive down cost and why we slowed down dramatically there as well.

Our next question comes from Tim Rezvan with Sterne Agee.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
First question is on the winter. I know you provided some color before on the previous question. But as far as the rest of your wells that you drilled in 2014, can you talk broadly about kind of zones you're testing and maybe kind of where you'll be drilling regarding the East or West flanks of that Red Wash unit?
Charles B. Stanley
So the next horizontal well will be on the sort of Westerly side, west and north side of the black box is strong and that is called Red Wash unit. So it will test an area that is deeper, higher pressure, but we will stay in the same interval. Our focus has been really in trying to drill in the same geologic interval, the lower Neslen [ph] for 2 reasons: one, to evaluate its potential across our acreage; two, as we've said before, we struggle to drill these wells. The rock is highly abrasive. It eats bits, so we've been working on a well design in the landing zone where we can achieve reasonable penetration rates, reasonable daily grinding rates on this rock, if you will. And we think we've done that. So rather than jumping around and drilling other horizons where we don't -- where we haven't developed that knowledge yet, we'd like to focus on getting good at and driving economics in one zone, and then, we can extrapolate it to other intervals. So our next well will be a horizontal well, will be over on the northwest corner.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then, I guess, subsequent wells, are you looking at one result and then deciding...
Charles B. Stanley
We're looking at -- we're doing it on a well-by-well basis, Tim, because we really want to understand every single well that we've done. And we've changed things. We've changed bit selection. We've changed landing zone. We use the same basic completion design on the first 5 wells, proppant loadings of about 400 or 500 pounds of foot, plug and perf, et cetera. We went to a tripling in 1,500 foot roughly of proppant. We've shortened up the lateral because we think that we can't stimulate a long lateral adequately. And we went to sliding sleeves in response to our concerns about residence time of frac fluid on the wells using plug and perf. All of those things seem to have been positive. So now we want to take all of the cumulative knowledge that we've learned about drilling and completion and apply it to the next well and have time to evaluate the results before we jump off and start drilling a program of horizontal wells.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's very helpful. And then, quickly on the Bakken. I know you have 40 wells, roughly, I guess, uncompleted right now. Are those all configured to accommodate this new completion recipe?
Charles B. Stanley
Yes.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then, can you talk broadly, if you decided you wanted to kind of bring those on, how quickly could you theoretically do that? And that's kind of a question that folks are trying to get their hands around this we look at this backlog.
Jim E. Torgerson
Right now, we're just running one frac crew. If we want to add another frac crew, which we can do now, they're available. We can probably get them all on in 2.5 months, 3 months.
Charles B. Stanley
That was Jim Torgerson by the way.

Our next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Chuck, a question for you. I guess, thinking about the Uinta, it seems like you are a lot more positive. I know you've always talked about the resource potential, but it seems like just the language has changed. Is it just what you're seeing for the new wells, or you're just being more open about it now? Or can you just talk about -- you've made some pretty bold statements about being Pinedale-like, so just want to figure out exactly where that's coming from.
Charles B. Stanley
Well, there's no doubt, David, that there's a huge resource of gas in place in the Uinta Basin on our acreage. And I think if you could have sat in on planning meetings for this company even back before the spinoff, we've talked internally about how do we get that gas out of the ground. And what we've seen is an evolution in technology that has been driven by activities in the Haynesville, the Williston, the Permian, even in the Marcellus and other areas where technology has evolved. And bit technology to drill this stuff has evolved dramatically in the past few years, and it's really the ability to assemble technologies that have been developed across a variety of plays, unconventional plays in North America that suddenly seemed to be coming together, that allow us to not only get the gas out of the ground but get it out of the ground at very economic rates. And -- it's that excitement. This last well, I think, really is sort of the -- it's the pinnacle of applying all the different technologies, and we think that we need to do it again, but we think that it's a huge step toward making this play economic and very economic compared to even Pinedale.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. Second question, the M&A commentary. You said -- has the bid/ask changed at all? I mean, are people -- I know as time goes, it'll change. But have you seen that yet, where people are starting to look at the strip and say, "okay, we're not going back to $90 tomorrow"? Has expectation started to change at all?
Charles B. Stanley
It's hard to look in seller's heads, but all you can do is look at the level of activity. And there are a few assets changing hands, but not many, and the assets that have been changing hands have been sort of, what I would call, noncore assets.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. Last question. Having been through -- I won't call you old, I will call you experienced. But having been through a few cycles, if you think about the ability -- there is some question about -- I guess, the cuts of the service companies have been so deep. There's some question of, hey, if oil is at $60 in 3Q and everybody decides to ramp back up, will the industry be able to do that? Will there be enough frac crews, enough people, et cetera? Kind of what are your views on that? If you start to see more E&Ps putting things back to work, do you think we'll see a tightness again? Or can you just talk about your expectations?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, unlike old guys like me who can't remember what they did yesterday, most of the guys on fractures are relatively young. And even though, they may be at the house right now, they could probably come back. And remember what they did last month. There's always a ramp-up period, right? I mean, when you look at either new areas that have evolved, as I was talking about, looking at the Haynesville, looking at the Williston and Permian, it takes a while to build reliable, efficient services in any area. And I think you'll see that sort of new play ramp-up in efficiency as crews and rigs come back. But there's a huge inventory of hardware and people. And I think as it comes back, it comes back with a hydrated group of people operating. So it's probably not as painful as you might imagine if you were incrementing that one last rig back in 2009, when everything that could drill was stood up and drilling before the bottom fell out of the gas markets back in '08, '09. So I don't think it will be as inefficient, but there is -- I'm not a student of service company margins as much as maybe I should be. But looking at the margins of the service companies, we squeeze them pretty hard, and so they are right at the edge of profitability. And it's just going to be tough for them to increment fleets or increment technology without a little better margin. So I think there's going to be -- the tables will turn back to the service companies trying to apply pressure to us to raise rates.

Our next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons.
Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Chuck, I wanted to touch on the M&A market for a second in kind of a different route. As far as bid/ask spread, I'm sure that it's still wide. I think you're right, there's nothing material that's really changed hands. But in regards to your attitude about what makes the most strategic sense for you guys, you always refer to contiguous acreage and that makes sense. But when you look at either the commodity prices and how the dynamics have changed over the last few months and/or what you've been able to recognize because of your new completions in various areas. Has it changed your thinking at all as to which areas will be most beneficial for you guys to add an additional acreage position?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, I think we've said before that we're a returns focused management team or returns focused company, we look for opportunities to increment acreage where we can generate good returns on invested capital. I wouldn't say we're commodity agnostic. I mean -- But I think that our view on commodity has changed some. Our drive for a shift away from gas toward a more balanced portfolio of oil and gas properties was in large part because the returns were so much better on the oil side. Now that paradigm has shifted and is not as compelling. So if we can find opportunities to increment acreage in areas where we can generate superior returns on the gas side, we're not going to shy away from looking at those opportunities. We haven't seen a lot, but that's not to say that they might not present themselves.
Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Could you potentially rank your different plays in regards to current rates of return?
Charles B. Stanley
Even at the current price, Williston still stands up quite well in our portfolio. I think it's too early to really put the Uinta into the mix, but I think the Uinta is going to come in at sort of on par with the Permian if we can sustain repeatable well performance and continue to drive down cost. And then, Pinedale behind that. Haynesville, just because it's dry gas and it's an area that we keep because we think it's a great option to dry gas exposure, but that was probably the lowest return in our portfolio.
Brian David Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. And then, probably doesn't make as much of a difference over the short term, but over the longer term in the Permian, just thinking about your -- the third-party processing issues that you've had, kind of how are you thinking about getting that rectified through both the current situation and then moving forward, what are we going to make sure that, that's not an issue?
Charles B. Stanley
We think we've adequately addressed that. I'm not going to go into details about it.

In the interest of time, our final question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
I just have a quick question on South Antelope's inventory. At year end '13, you all disclosed 250 gross locations, which reflected, I think, 4 Middle Bakken wells and 3 Three Forks wells per DSU. So if you completed about 70 wells in 2014, that would give you about 172 gross locations left. What do you think the, just the ballpark impact of these spacing tests could do to that inventory? And maybe, how many wells do you anticipate completing this year and that are factored into your budget?
Charles B. Stanley
So I'll answer the last question first. We're looking at a total of -- add it up here on a -- 68, roughly, gross operated wells that we'll complete in the Williston this year. I don't have it broken out, I'm sorry, by Pinedale -- I'm sorry, by South Antelope versus Fort Berthold. On the infill question, it's pretty simple math. If you take the 4 and 3, it's actually 3.5 roughly, 4 wells in the Middle Bakken, and 3.5 in the first bench. It depends on the success of the current infill pilot. If we can stick 2 wells in between, then you have roughly 400 additional wells. If you can stick 2, it's a couple of hundred additional wells at South Antelope. And that ignores any potential for the second and third benches. Now what we may do, with respect to the second and third benches, is stagger second and third bench completions and eliminate some of the infill on the first bench. But that's -- it's still early days. But that's the magnitude, 200 to 400-plus, depending on the success of the infill pilot, just on South Antelope.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. And then, I think you made a comment to that. The change in your completion design is actually impacting how you think about well density, given what happens to the fracture network. So can you just maybe expand upon that a little bit and just talk about how this change in completion design actually enhances your views on down-facing potential on that property?
Charles B. Stanley
Sure. Unfortunately, we can't go down into the Earth and view the fracture network and what's going on. But we can infer from well performance and from watching the offset wells as we frac, that by increasing the proppant loading, we're getting shorter, more complex fractures. And as a result, if you think about a body of rock that may have been 3 feet by 3 feet a cube, 3 feet by 3 feet, with fractures on all sides of it, now, maybe, we're subdividing that body into 9 cubes, so that we're effectively reducing the size of the fracture network. And we're contacting the matrix with prop fractures, so the oil doesn't have as far to go. So we're breaking the rock up, we're making the fracture network more complex, and we're draining more of the oil in place. We also are likely to have less impact on offset wells because the fractures just aren't traveling as far. They're becoming more complex. They're staying closer to the well bore and they're breaking the rock up closer to the well bore. But I think it is important to point out that we do anticipate a degradation in well performance with these infill wells. There's ultimately only so much oil in the rock that you can recover. And when we add additional fake points in the reservoir at closer spacing, inherently, they're going to compete with each other for production or for recovery of oil from the reservoir. And we're running our economics. We're modeling these infill wells at about 60% of the original parent, 60% to 65% of the original parent. And I think that's conservative. I think it'll turn out to be a pessimistic view, but that's the economics that we're using to evaluate infill development. So if you have a 1 million barrel parent well, 600 to 650 MBoe of incremental recovery from the infill well is the way to think about it. And obviously, as we gather more data and have more well performance data, we can fine-tune that. But that's what I would suggest that you use as a starting point.
