Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results of the first half year of 2015. Before we start with the call, I would like to use the opportunity to invite you personally to our sell side analyst dinner on 7th September in London. You should have received an invitation recently. Todayâs call will be hosted by Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO.
I will now hand over to Georg Denoke.
Georg Denoke
Thank you, Dominik and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and a warm welcome also from my side. As always, I will start with a high level summary of the development in the first half of 2015 on slide three.
We realized an increase of revenues by 10% to EUR9 billion, operating profit increased by 11% to EUR2.1 billion. On a currency adjusted basis revenue was on last yearâs level, operating profit was 0.4% higher than last year. The positive effect from the weakening of the Euro against many currencies further increased in the second quarter. Healthcare also delivered stronger growth. Nevertheless, the overall macroeconomic environment remained challenging.
Please be informed that non-recurring items of EUR138 million are related to restructuring measures. Later, I will give you some more background on this topic. With 23.3%, the Group margin was slightly up. The operating cash flow development was very strong and increased by 54.9%. EPS before non-recurring items was up by 8.6%. I would like to move on to the development of revenue and operating profit by division on the next slide.
The revenue development of the gases division benefited from the strong tailwind from exchange rates and a slight improvement in comparable growth. Including the bolt-on acquisition of the Australian LPG business growth was 2.7% in the second quarter. 
Engineering revenues developed in line with project progress. Revenues were 4.7% below the level of last year. On the right side of the slide, youâll see that the gases division generated an operating profit of EUR2.1 billion. The margin improved by 40 basis points.
The engineering division realized an operating profit of EUR114 million as expected due to a change in the project mix, the margin came in at 8.4% in line with our guidance of around 8%. I will now move on to a more detailed review of the performance in the gases division on slide number five. 
The positive currency contribution from the weaker Euro of 10.4% was moderated by headwinds from natural gas prices of 1.8% and the capital of other sectors to which I will come shortly.
On the first half basis comparable growth was 1.9%. This development was also supported by the acquisition of the LPG business in Australia which is included since March. Please be aware that comparable growth was negatively affected by a couple of factors, including the expected end of contracts in the onsite business, lower LPG prices, and the repeal of the carbon tax in Australia, in the merchant part of our business. Adjusted for these additional effects, comparable growth would have been 1.4% six points higher and in total 3.3% gross.
Please note that this figure is not adjusted for the lower pass-through of electrical energy costs. I would like to go through comparable growth and adjustments for additional effects on the next slide, where we will see the development of the product areas. 
Healthcare recorded strong comparable growth of 7.4%, driven most significantly by a volume growth at Lincare. Volumes in healthcare also developed nicely in all other geographies.
Continuing to onsite, comparable growth in this product area increased by 1%. The development was restrained by the end of contracts, excluding this effect onsite would have recorded comparable growth of plus 3.5%. Pipe revenues increased by 1.1% on a comparable basis as economic conditions in the southern hemisphere, specifically Australia, South Africa and Brazil remain challenging. Growth was affected by lower LPG prices without this effect comparable growth in pipe would have amounted to 2.8%.
In cylinder, comparable growth amounted to minus 1.2%. The development was negatively affected by lower LPG prices and the repeal of the Australian carbon tax. Excluding these two effects, cylinder would have grown by 0.2%.
I would now like to continue with revenues by operating segments on slide seven. Revenue in EMEA declined by 1.5% on a comparable basis. Primarily due to the end of the contract in Italy, as well as persistently challenging economic environment in Africa. On the other hand we continue to experience positive growth momentum in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. By product area, the highest contribution to growth continued to be from Healthcare. 
In Asia Pac comparable growth was 1.4%. Given all the discussions on the development in China, I would like to mention that we had a solid compatible growth development in China in the first half of this year. The South Pacific region continues to be impacted by negative economic trends. From a product area perspective in Asia Pacific we saw strongest growth in onside. In the Americas, revenue grew by 21.8% compatible growth further accelerated to 7%, the development was supported by the strong performance of the North American industry gases business and the strong performance of Lincare. Meanwhile the economic climate in South America continue to weak.
Proceeding now to the operating profits by operating segments, I'll move on to the next slide. Operating profit in EMEA increase by 2.9%. The operating margin was 30.4% primarily due to higher contributions from Middle East and Eastern Europe. In Asia Pac, operating profit increased by 13%, the operating profit development in Asia Pac was supported by trends from the exchange rates. As for the Americas OP increased by 28.1% with a margin of 25%. The improvement in the margins was mainly driven by our North American business.
Let's now take a look at the Engineering division on slide nine. I have already outlined the revenue and margin development in the beginning. Due to the low oil price many customer's has postponed their investment decisions. In particular in the petrochemical industry. This is reflected in a 32% lower order intake in the first half of this year. This lower order intake and shifts of parts of the bigger project into the next year will impact the revenue development in the second half of the year. Therefore we have lowered the 2015 revenue outlook range for engineering to EUR 2.5 to EUR 2.7 billion. The order backlog of EUR 4.2 billion remained solid.
I will now move on to a brief update on our restructuring measures. The refinement of our organizational model has been introduced at the beginning of the year and the corresponding measures are now in implementation. The restructuring measures in the Southern hemisphere mainly Australia, South Africa and South America are presently in implementation. Further potential savings have also been identified. Therefore, the cost of the restructuring measures have increased to EUR138 million in the first half of this year. Additionally, we expect to incur cost of around EUR50 million in the second half of this year. With these measures the expected savings from restructuring have increased to around EUR130 million over the years. The financial position is outlined on the next slide, which is in slide 11. 
The cash flow from operating activities kept its growth across in the second quarter. In the first half of 2015 the operating cash flow improved by 55% to EUR1.6 billion. This positive trend was supported by the strong development of the reported operating profit as well as efficient working capital management. Accordingly, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved from 2.1 times at the end of 2014 to 2 times at the end of the reporting period. This development was achieved despite currency headwinds on financial debt denominated in foreign currency. 
During the reporting period, we successfully extended the maturity of the EUR2.5 billion committed syndicated credit facility which all 33 participating banks until 2020. This guarantees our liquidity will remain very solid. The credit ratings were confirmed at A plus with S&P and A2 with Moody's. The outlook of both ratings is stable.
I conclude with the outlook on the next slide. As a result of the reduced expectations for the engineering division, we have lowered the outlook for the group revenues for this year. This means that depending on economic trends and exchange rate developments, we now anticipate that revenues will be in the range from EUR17.9 billion to EUR18.5 billion versus the previous range of EUR18.2 billion to EUR19 billion. 
However, I would like to point out that we are reconfirming the 2015 outlook for the group operating profit are of between EUR4.1 billion to EUR4.3 billion. Our 2015 return on capital employee target also remains unchanged at 9% to 10%. We are now halfway through the year, which allows us to update also the outlook for the gases division. So far, the tailwind from the exchange rates has been a bit stronger than expected. 
Despite the negative impact from lower pass-through effects, we have increased the target range for the gases division. Depending on the economic trends and exchange rate developments we now target to achieve revenues of EUR15.1 billion to EUR15.5 billion versus previously EUR14.9 billion to EUR15.4 billion and regarding operating profit between EUR4.1 billion and EUR4.3 billion versus EUR4.05 billion to EUR4.25 billion previously.
As mentioned earlier, we have adjusted outlook for the engineering division. We now planned to generate revenues between EUR2.5 billion and EUR2.7 billion. The assumption for the operating margin of around 8% remains unchanged. We confirmed our medium term target for 2017 of group operating profit between EUR4.5 billion to EUR4.7 billion and the return on capital employed of 11% to 12%. 
Please note that these targets are based on exchange rates prevailing from when the targets were communicated at the end of October 2014. I also reconfirmed our HBO targets of gross cost savings of EUR750 million to EUR900 million in the four years from 2013 to 2016. Additionally the restructuring measures shall deliver around EUR180 million savings.
Thank you for your attention. We are happy to take your questions now. Operator, please you may now call for questions from the audience. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Dear ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Marcos Maia [ph]. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey good morning gentlemen. Two questions if I may. Firstly on the underlying growth which was then around 4.2% for Q2. So adjusted for this is one offs, is this a good to run-rate for the second half or do you expect next year due to the base effect acceleration of this year via gross rate. 
And then secondly when you also trust and the spike in â in particular the back business for this LPG issue here in the second quarter are stronger than the first quarter are there any reason for this any kind of market or end markets which the demand has accelerated? Thanks for the questions for â these questions.
Georg Denoke
Yes thank you Marcos for your questions. Before I answer these I only want to correct myself a gesture from my team here that I mentioned on the savings effect on page 10 of the refinement of the organization a model I chat EUR130 million and of course on the slide you see EUR180 million which is the right number. So I want to correct this at the beginning immediately. To your questions Marcos I think on the LPG side as you know the LPG business is seasonal and is more pronounced to the winter period and as we have the majority of our LPG business in the southern hemisphere which is South Africa and South Pacific you see here the acceleration of that impact in Q2 compared to Q1 and also of course that business is growing at in these months faster with the impact of the lower temperatures in the southern hemisphere that will continue also in Q3 of course depending on the weather specially for heating purposes. 
From an underlying perspective as we said I think we assume when we look into the development of the different product areas and healthcare business which remains this level or is even slightly bigger from the perspective of the market development in home care specially Lincare so there is a little bit of upside compared to the 7% which you saw here in the numbers 7.4% in on-site I think you will see this impact of the end of contract throughout the year that the top-line is not coming through really stronger but can keep the level on the adjusted basis I think this is what we have here as an around 3% to 3.5%, that will be different the next year when that is behind us.
And in bulk and cylinder depending of course on the economic development we can assume a little bit of an acceleration in bulk and cylinder for the second half normally also second half has an slightly stronger pronunciation specially in the month September-October-November that is I think what we have therefore I think I donât want to carry you away but with this I think you can underpin the underlying you were referring to Marcos.
Unidentified Analyst
Yeah just a short add on question on this LPG effect I saw that but she would be mainly booked in your cylinder business not so much in bulk?
Georg Denoke
Itâs both its bulk and cylinder. LPG bulk also in specially Australia.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Clark, Societe Generale. Your line is now open please go ahead.
Peter Clark
Good afternoon. Thank you. A couple of questions please, on the restructuring the additional EUR100 million I know you try to give them some specially where itâs coming I am just wondering I am under the impression that something might be going on more in Europe a bit more in engineering rather than just the troubled southern hemisphere? That was the first question. 
And then on the backlog all the gases negotiations proposals opportunities et cetera just wondering if there anything that you feel is close to signature or not coming up? And then just finally just a clarification I think youâre trying to answer this in terms of the cylinder growth in the second quarter when you strip out the LPG pricing effect and the mining effect sorry in the government tax effect it looks like it was up 0.8% just to clarify that really is the clean acquisition that does about without that it wouldnât be much different from the Q1 number? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yeah, starting with the last question directly Peter yes thatâs the case I think cylinder still was weak but supported by the small acquisition with a little bit of acceleration in some of the end markets I think that is true on the backlog of gases I think weâre not talking about contracts but definitely the opportunity pipeline has not changed therefore we havenât put it into the pack year and thatâs based itâs on the same outlook as we communicated on the beginning of the year. There maybe one or other projects which we could report but I think we wait here for the next quarter to update you on that development.
Restructuring I think youâre right from the perspective of acceleration of measures is more in the Southern hemisphere, of course when we talk about the refinement of the organization and model that also is impacting Europe here from the set up and therefore you will also see Europe thatâs included in the refinement of the organization model. Thank you.
Peter Clark
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Tyler, Redburn. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Neil Tyler
Thank you good afternoon and just one on healthcare please, the acceleration that youâre referring to in the home care business particularly Lincare, can you talk a little bit around whatâs behind that? And then also if you can help me understand what amount of revenues in absolute terms are likely to be impacted next year who are covered by rebids next year? And any expectations you have around timeframe and the timeframe of which you would expect to recover the lost revenue to the pricing? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yeah I think the acceleration we see is really against this pattern which we communicated when we did the acquisition at the bulk the consolidation in the different sums is about the growing patient base from the perspective of having more patients being impacted by CUPD on a quarter by quarter basis and that is as you know itâs mighty year, mighty decades trend based on the perspective of the ageing population and that Baby Boomers are coming on screen as potential patients which is of â probably for each patient but as they now turn 65 DCH where this disease is further developed. That is what you see and we see in consolidation based on the competitive bidding of last year in some of the competitive bidding areas because there are less participants in the market area.
Related to the competitive biddings I think it would be a little bit really too early here now to get in confirmation on something which is under discussion so there is an assumption that thereâs an impact for CB3 for the full year of next year rising up through the quarters and through the half year. I think this is what we expect and therefore the next year definitely hasnât proportion and a bigger impact of that competitive bidding. We will do here 30 cost works as you know that from the last competitive bidding exercise where we have shut down around 100 centers compared to 1,100 centers we had at the beginning and that will then impact this time probably the full year base of the revenues compared to competitive bidding to where the second half was introduced. The bulk the size really I want to be a little bit cautious at that stage because it has to be reconfirmed and we have to do the math here and we will update you when we have confirmed.
Neil Tyler
Okay. Thank you. So just a follow up on the first part of that question thereâs nothing in the volume growth regionally that youâre seeing that relates to sort of share gains in regions with the subject to competitive bidding 3 itâs much more to do with whatâs already happened?
Georg Denoke
Yeah, this is the point. The cost of three it would be too earlier right againâ¦
Neil Tyler
So this one is preemptive move?
Georg Denoke
Exactly no, but no people donât move from that one because you know that you can keep your patient base and you can still hunt patients and those who are in afterwards they will continue to hunt patients and therefore the impact of competitive bidding 3 will really come into the next year so itâs better to point related to your question.
Neil Tyler
Okay. Thank you. Thatâs helpful.
Operator
Thank you the next question comes from Thomas Gilbert, UBS. Your line is now open please go ahead.
Thomas Gilbert
Thank you very much. Two questions from my side. Can you rationalize the strong receivable performance price as we collecting those against the backdrop of the strong growth in healthcare? I would have exactly expected the opposite in the cash flow statement. So where did you collect -- as we impacting engineering or which you can put a bit of quality around the receivables performance.
And then second one is a bit of more generic one, we I mean I actually thought that restructuring in the gases industry would be sort of one two quarter. I think we now seeing an extension of the restructuring program and then there is obviously -- coming which will require maybe some cost restructuring above. Do we have to put in 12 models sort of 0.5% of revenue for exception why this restructuring going forward or do you think is this really, really specific to just reorganizing the setup. Or is there is a something more structural there.
Georg Denoke
So thank you for your question Thomas. I think I start really also with the last question to give an answer. I think we keep the non-recurring items for this year. I think it's related to the refinement of the organizational model and it's related to the restructuring mainly of the Southern Hemisphere. And I think that remains the case, that we do and that we did cost optimization at the efficiency work against HPO and against a competitive bidding that something which is our continuous business. I think as we have to answer that but I wouldn't let say or I don't want to give the indication that we continue then next year with something which is non-recurring item. The pronunciation which we have seen here is exactly related to the topics mentioned on that slide. And that's where then the end of the year the period where this ends.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay, clear. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
On the accounts receivables I think across we are passionate about accounts receivables because it's a stronger performance in gases on the broader context and also engineering hatch from the mix effects of project and relatively good performance. So it's behind these two things and gases has a slight improvement and a continuous improvement program, engineering is always a little bit more difficult to forecast based on the project mix as you know best.
Thomas Gilbert
There was nothing like an end of quarter balance sheet impact or one big customer.
Georg Denoke
No I think what we have seen last year as you know but I donât know if this refers really to this quarter. I think it was last year against the first quarter more that you had on in Sunday, the months end or on a weekend. And then you see some certain shifts which are not coming in because of the end of the quarter on a weekend. But overall it's a normal performance itâs a normal pattern.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Klein, Berenberg. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Klein
Gentlemen, hi there and good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I've only got one left, in terms of the engineering revenue, how much of this could be related to -- for that you seeing invoicing slipping into 2016. Can you give us a bit of a flavor between how you're see in Q4 invoicing and then Q1 invoicing in engineering thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yeah I think this is PUC as you know. We are doing percentage of completion is according to the progress of the individual projects which we see therefore. When I said that it's an impact this year of a bigger project shifted into the next year which means they as a slower contribution visible this year. But that does not mean that we top here and continue next year. So that is a continuous effort and it's about the project mix of the percentage of completion mainly related to cost where we have multi-year projects. 
Therefore there is nothing which we can communicate about and slippage into the year as we communicated only the change in our expectations of revenues for the full year in engineering.
John Klein
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Benson, Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Benson
Yeah. Thanks very much. Just a few some minors ones. My questions really the efficiency of 750 to 900 wasn't quite clear. Does that include the restructuring or is that excludes it? And what do you think might be the sort of the net benefits? 
My guess is change in expectation is that entirely affects or the other mixes and the change in the outlook on the delay in engineering business. Is that all third party business so this causing that short fall or is it because you got delays in the tonnage contracts whether being supplied internally as it were and that is also adversely effecting profit. So just wanted understand whether the delays that you are seeing also have relevance for the outlook for the tonnage business and lastly if I may some of that list and if you can just try and indicate where pricing and volumes have gone in the gases business? Well that would be great.
Georg Denoke
Okay. So on the efficiency to be very clear. I think the numbers I reconfirmation of growth cost savings of our program which once since several of the years as you know the HP all programs. So that's not including the savings out of the restructuring measures. I think that's the separate thing. Therefore in HP all we talk about gross cost savings as we always answer these questions. It depends on the also macroeconomic environment when you have happen ask the growing and wire-man, then you normally can keep a little bit more whereas where you have a soft economically and wire-man then that is significantly less. 
So and these fortune 500 studies you know these I know these. This is an significantly below 50% or sometimes a little bit more than 50% from an gross cost savings perspective and I think we are rather on the soft end when we see the macroeconomic and wire-man. On the 180 of course the restructuring measures that is a different patent because that is related to these individual matters. You can say of course some of that is because of a weak economic environment in the Southern Hemisphere. 
So it's a compensation which is not all coming bottom line because they haven't been or hasn't been an acceleration in most of these end markets. But if this would come then we would come stronger so that and here the tag rate is definitely higher I think. When we then talk about the correction of the mix effect you were mentioning. This is really mainly true FX. 
When we talk about price volume I think that is an important question because it's difficult really to read that out of the slides on page type because here you have the price volume of course on the 3.3% you have the LPG adjusted. I think that is the right way to look into that because LPG contract prices when they are down and carbon tax repeal is also something which you have to consider.
So when you only look into merchant business which is the direct MP PGP business which is impacted by these. We say that it's roughly one-third is pricing and two-third is volume in that business which is closer effected through price initiative. So you have roughly two-thirds volume one-third pricing in that mix for the industry business. I think on side is related to contract P, you have the negative cost re-effects on natural gas as you know you have the negative pass-through effects. 
Also on electrical energy which we have not adjusted here and therefore you would see that development not visible and also with the end of contract of course here. Some of the roads which was coming through new contracts is less visible because of these end of contracts. I think I explained that. So from this perspective industrial merchant is as I said. On the delay of the engineering, it's really a shift of the execution of progress. It's an slow down that's a sure -- project and all what I mentioned and the reason why we have a lower debt is related to order intake related to oil and gas market development and therefore its third party.
Andrew Benson
As you see like â you talked about picture chemical delays come with --
Georg Denoke
Yeah. I said nothing specific therefore your question was valid to ask in which area is this and you are not wrong in anticipation of a petrochemical side.
Andrew Benson
But all the delays are saying relate to third party business. Your tonnage programs remain on track, is that correct?
Georg Denoke
Yeah. Itâs here with what you know, what we introduced already in October last year that we see a shift from emerging contribution through the lower growth environment in some of the emerging markets. But you are right the contribution is coming through from a project perspective. Overall we need to make that point roughly 10% of the order backlog is related to the in term gases business at that stage.
Andrew Benson
Thank you very much.
Georg Denoke
Thanks Andrew.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Walsh
Yeah. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon Wolfgang. I had a few questions if I can. Just in terms of the healthcare business within Lincare. Sorry just trying to a better sphere on the repeating next year. To understand if the Medicare was about half of that business from a revenue perspective. Could you just give an idea as to what prior â process is of in terms of driving pricing down? And you will sort of magnitude a reset? 
Secondly, some more generic question around M&A, we're seeing in increasing number of deals being announced around the sector both within Europe and overseas as well traffic land take? How you're feeling about M&A is there scope for big deals in the world of gases still? Or is it still very much the case that a both on more likely? And just final question how are you feeling about that the potential to get terms off this year or do you think that's more 2016 business? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yeah. These are three broader questions within kind of repetition of what I already answered. I think itâs specially related to the Lincare part. On M&A I think yes itâs true that we are focusing both on acquisition as we always point out and you have seen some of that through smaller expense this year and of course we are working continuously on opportunities when we believe that this is possible and that would fit into business strategy.
Paul Walsh
And have you been prepared to get ready so that I mean sizing around that those kind of opportunities?
Georg Denoke
I think it would be the wrong guidance but as I always said and I don't refer now to 2015 only I refer to my general answer. We are definitely good for acquisitions between letâs say 50 million to 200 million of impact if opportunities are there. Then that would be possible.
Paul Walsh
Understand and I'll -- just once more Wolfgang. Are you able to give any sense as to what previous bidding process have driven in terms of pricing or is that â too sensitive for you to give out?
Georg Denoke
I have to correct you Paul. Sorry but my name is Georg and I am not Wolfgang-
Paul Walsh
Sorry.
Georg Denoke
If you know but I have to address you now because you are saying at the second time. So I think it is really premature to discuss these things we have all bolt-on acquisition. There are opportunities you know and lower interest environment there are small businesses which are owned by families. Normally families let's say not willing to sell in very low interest environment because they don't know where they want to put the money which they get afterwards. So they rather run the business on their own but there are opportunities and we have to update when we go through that on a quarter basis.
Paul Walsh
Yeah. That's not problem, apologies for the name, I jumped on the call late so I was coming into it call. Sorry about that.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander
Good morning. Could you flash out your comments about Asia macroeconomic trends into a little bit more of a two to three year kind of outlook? You are seeing any shifts in order bidding that might give you a feel for how demand is are evolving over the next couple of years for your project.
Georg Denoke
Yeah of course it's a quarterly call and I can try and everyone is keen to understand what the development is. I think we made a point on China which had solid development really in our numbers. I think you have and that is what we already pointed out we have been softening on the merchant market development on many of these emerging markets in Asia. We were pointing out in the last call that there were Thailand softened, Malaysia softer than we expected. We have seen and we are little bit stronger as you know and nevertheless the equity markets are running faster than the industrial production which is impacting our growth of course.
But overall I would say the as longer as we go into the future as better for us because that means loading and consolidation of that market which sometimes is effected by spot markets through collective structures which are failing into these markets. So from this perspective, I'm on a mid-term to effect rather hopeful that we are we improving especially our return on capital employed improvement. And that is I think here the point and we assume a certain recovery over the quarters but definitely '15 is relatively soft at that point in time when we cut out the least effect. -- Time when we look into APAC overall, I think you have to see that across Australia is eating into this visibility of growth in some of the Asian markets which is definitely than more pronounced.
Laurence Alexander
Like I guess as part from an efficient part are you seeing actual CapEx projects or new projects that you're bidding on getting pushbacks 6 or 12 months or is the bidding pipeline in the region still be relatively consistent?
Georg Denoke
I think definitely we see I think and development as we pointed out already in the past which is a little bit softer when we look into the guidance from opportunities. We have lowered that guidance and that also includes some of the Asian markets. Nevertheless, there are certain projects where we bid for that is also true. But it's softer than when you go back two three years ago definitely.
Laurence Alexander
Yeah, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Martin RÃ¶diger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin RÃ¶diger
Thank you also three questions from my side. First on engineering, you mentioned the reason for the lower -- take was oil and gas or petrochemicals. But what was the region which of course the big steps for you in terms of order intake it was a North America or Middle East or other regions. Second question is of more clarification question about the growth prospects in the gas. You mentioned that the opportunity expanding as far as I remember engineering is go open it for industrial gases. 
Now order intake poor if you want and it can too. Does that have no impact on the growth opportunities in the industrial gases going forward? And third question on the EBITDA guidance in 2015, you mentioned in the press release that your outlook is that there is continued weak demand that will remain challenge for the at the end of the second half. We want to convey that your EBITDA target which today was -- is now bit more challenging than it was in March or in May.
Georg Denoke
I start definitely with your last question. The answer is simply no, it's not more challenging I think at that stage. Because we also see as I pointed out when you're listening to the one of the first questions to and kind of acceleration on the industrial merchant side. Which is coming through hopefully a little bit stronger so that is not the case. And that's a confirmation for the full year. When you were asking about the split of the order intake, I think as I always say and I remain with the -- across in your mind as you know. Don't compare engineering on a quarterly basis, itâs a lumpy business. 
Nevertheless I can point out so second quarter was a little bit stronger than the first one. You can say yes the second quarter of last year was especially weak, but overall we have seen against the third quarter which was in 60% reduction we have seen now in the half year, we are 30% below for last year. So from this perspective it's on geographical perspective. It's for all geographies and the order intake is related to all geographies in a way with one-third. We have projects on Europe, America and Asia. Well that is no specific thing I can point out. 
But engineering is they are having gases from an overall perspective of opportunity business definitely the case that is also mend from an mid-term and long-term perspective where have open gates as you know especially in the middle East through strong support of engineering and foundation of joint ventures with important customer's. So I think there is no change in that pattern and therefore it's very difficult now to really talk about an expectation of order intake at the current stage in the petrochemical industry. I think that is understood from your side also.

Thank you. The next question comes from Van [ph].Your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. The momentum in the cylinder business remain weakest regions and end markets. Are you seeing weaker demand and what are you doing to again revise growth of this attractive for cylinder business? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
The initiatives of course are related to customer retention are related to applications which means you are proposing also really on the small end of the business where you have handy corrector, with only a few cylinders. So from an overall perspective that is the focus. The pattern which is affecting most of the cylinder visibility is really still Australia. We have seen different development with a slightly better pattern in continental Europe, difficulties more in the Northern part of Europe at that point in time. So with a mix picture. But the big impact at that stage is Australia. Middle East, Eastern Europe relatively better with something which is really a little bit ahead of the development in Q1.

Okay, thank you Georg.

Thank you. The next question comes from Sebastian Satz, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Sebastian Satz
Thank you very much. Two questions, short ones. Sorry if you give the answer earlier and I've missed it. Do you see any contribution the first half already or is it coming in the second half of the year? The second question again is slightly broader one on regional margins and the potential there, do you see any of the region is much more profitable than Asia and the Americas? How much of that do you think is cyclical? Let's say pricing pressure and Chinese merchant and how much of that do you see a structural let's say a lack of some of the business in the U.S.? Thanks very much.
Georg Denoke
From a first question point of view I think the Dara [ph], I think we began receiving really customer payments according to contractual agreement at the end of that quarter and of course the bigger impact is therefore in the second half of the year. I think this is what I can tell you. Then on the margin development in...
Sebastian Satz
Do we see that in the EBITDA line or it's in the growth as well?
Georg Denoke
It's both.
Sebastian Satz
Okay. Just to clarify. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Okay. So then on the EMEA margin development I think EMEA is of course and strong put hold from an overall perspective and as you see one comp of the margin development is of course also related to the lower pass-through. I think there is one part which is the calculation impact and then you do have, then you overall look and little bit further acceleration especially in central Europe and Eastern Europe from a perspective. I think that is something where you can say that we have a consolidated base in Europe and when acceleration comes then that acceleration comes within kind of additional contribution to the margin. And then you were asking Americas. So can you repeat that Sebastian?
Sebastian Satz
Yeah, just to look at the difference between the margins that you have the 25% EBITDA margin versus 30% in Europe is that a question of density or just do you like cylinder business to get the same kind of margin level.
Georg Denoke
No. I think the cylinder business in North America would be â as you look into pure cylinder and pure cylinder played and you don't have that margin normally. I think itâs a mix effect of also the patent then this we move into for example on-site business as you know the â of the US is not ours in the full dimension of when we look into the competition. Therefore that is one part which is holding back the margins here but it has no impact from the density with CPGP business. I would say that is the reason and then across as we pointed out Lincare is contributing to that business of course also in sizable part but that is below the European margin when you look from OP perspective but it's contributing to North America.
Sebastian Satz
And sorry the last one just on Asia so as you mentioned that earlier but â margin came back quite a bit I guess a lot of that is due to Australia. But how much would also be would Australia might be a structural issue, but how of that might simply be a cyclical one so low utilization in some of your emerging plant in China?
Georg Denoke
Yeah. I think this really to point out here again it is about Australia and itâs also about these acquisition impact which is at that stage of pre-synergy impact itâs a smaller LPG acquisition where the synergies haven't been yet achieved and I think that makes the biggest part of difference.
Sebastian Satz
Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Macros Maia [ph]. Your line now open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Just a more broader question is this fair to assume that now when the all â of this current level that the kind of growth rates you have deposits of we are on 16 sometimes up to 8% are history and then there are more in the magnitude of 4% at the same time then also the cash flow the significantly different to this kind of growth is then the overall investment story for Linde for all industrial gases are these investments or is it the changing or have changed?
Georg Denoke
I think from cash flow perspective I think that quarter two was a very, very strong quarter therefore I wouldn't link that only to the growth pattern of certain parts of the business. I think definitely we lift as we told you in a challenging macroeconomic environment at that stage. Do we collect now all of growth pattern we have experienced I think I wouldn't support that. I think definitely there are certain capacities in the market when we look from an end customer perspective but it is not one dimensional, right? 
I think we have moved into other parts of the business like in the home care, healthcare arena, where we see some substitution for a lower parts in lower growth parts, in parts of the industrial business therefore I think definitely the macroeconomical environment is at that stage a little bit softer and that is what you see in the numbers. I think that's clear. On the oil price perspective when we talk about the installed base customers, off course that can support some customers who haven't installed based on lower there are other opportunities but for new opportunities probably you are right that this is a little bit softer at that stage.
