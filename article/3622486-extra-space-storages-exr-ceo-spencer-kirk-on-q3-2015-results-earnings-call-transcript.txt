Spencer Kirk
Hello, everyone. For 2015, the top two priorities at Extra Space are operational excellence and seamless integration of new stores on to our operating platform. Year-to-date, our focus on these priorities is paying off.
Operationally, we had a record breaking quarter. We excelled in producing same-store revenue growth of 9.9%, NOI growth of 12.6% and a peak occupancy of 94.9%. This enabled us to achieve FFO as adjusted growth of 12.5% on top of last yearâs growth of 26.3%. This marks 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit increases. Perform at this level while simultaneously preparing to close a large and complex transaction showcases the depth of our operationâs team and our ability to execute.
In the first three quarters, we added 82 wholly-owned stores to our platform. On October 1st, we closed our acquisition of SmartStop and integrated an additional 165 properties. This brings our store count to 1,335, all branded Extra Space. Preparations to have these stores began months earlier. Thanks to the work of our team and a cooperation of SmartStop, we were able to review financial systems, train employees, plan technology conversions, and evaluate CapEx needs well ahead of closing. There is still work to be done but we hit the ground running. This is the right acquisition at the right time for our shareholders.
And Iâd now like to turn the time over to Scott.
Scott Stubbs
Thanks, Spencer. Last night we reported FFO of $0.81 per share for the quarter. Excluding costs associated with acquisitions and non-cash interest, FFO as adjusted was $0.81 per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.02. The beat was primarily the result of better than expected property performance. This was partially offset by higher than forecasted income tax as well as an increase in interest expense as we accumulated the funds for the SmartStop acquisition.
Our same-store revenue growth was driven by higher rates to new and existing customers, increased occupancy and lower discount. Our top performing market year-to-date include Atlanta, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Tampa/St. Pete, all with double-digit revenue growth. Our platform continues to maximize results in this favorable operating environment.
During the quarter, we acquired one store in Maryland for $6.1 million and we acquired a certificate of occupancy store with a JV partner for $5.4 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired 124 stores for just over $1.3 billion. All but two of these stores were part of the SmartStop portfolio. We currently have 9 operating stores under contract for $82 million. Six of these acquisitions totaling $53 million are scheduled to close before the end of the year. In addition, we have another 17 certificate of occupancy stores under contract. The total purchase price of these stores is $177 million of which $26 million is expected to close in 2015.
We were active in the capital markets in the quarter. We filed a $400 million ATM under which we sold 31 million. We also issued 575 million in exchangeable senior notes and used a portion of the note proceeds to repurchase 164 million of an existing tranche of exchangeable notes. The October 1st, SmartStop acquisition as well as our strong year-to-date results require revisions to our guidance. Our full year FFO guidance is $2.69 to $2.72 per share. Our guidance includes dilution from a certificate of occupancy deals, acquisitions that operate below our portfolio average and $45 million in transactional and debt elimination costs related to the SmartStop acquisition they will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our FFOs adjusted increased to $3.10 to $3.13 per share which removes the non-cash interest and non-recurring transactional cost.
I will now turn the time back over to Spencer.
Spencer Kirk
Thanks, Scott. Fundamentals for the sector continue to be strong. New supply which is still muted will not be a factor in the next couple of years. We expect occupancy to remain at all time highs which should allow us to further increase rates for new and existing customers. Only time will tell if pricing power will remain as strong as it is today, but the fundamentals support the positive outlook. The acquisitions environment will continue to be extremely competitive and Extra Space will remain a disciplined buyer. Weâre focused on accretive acquisitions and maximizing shareholder value. Iâm pleased with the outstanding performance of our team. We have executed at a high level across the entire organization.
Now letâs turn the time back to Jeff to start the Q&A session.
Jeff Norman
Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyoneâs questions, I would ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limit it to two. If time allows, we will address follow-on questions once everyone has had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.
With that, we will turn it over to Melory to start a Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Becker with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Jeff Becker
My first question is on the integration of SmartStop. I know itâs only been a month but any lessons learned you could share with us on the underwriting of the deal, positive or negative and maybe specifically on some of the new markets youâve entered?
Scott Stubbs
Yes, in terms of underwriting and performance, I would tell you itâs probably too early to really comment on that. What I would say is the properties are performing right where we were expecting them to perform when we put this under contract several months ago. So, the occupancy and the revenue performance when we took them over, was right where we expected.
Spencer Kirk
With regards to the markets, one of the really nice things about this transaction is in many markets, we picked up even greater footprint which is going to give us greater presence digitally on the internet and allow us to further drive occupancy and rate at those stores. So, itâs coming together very well. We are pleased.
Jeff Becker
So too soon to tell if the underwriting was too conservative; it seems like the integration has gone very well, as you said, and then acquired properties performing better than expected within the first letâs say once and other deal.
Scott Stubbs
Everything is right on course; itâs too early to tell what the trend is but we are very satisfied with how we started.
Jeff Becker
And then I had just have one other question on the 17 certificate of occupancy under contract, I guess can you provide a little bit more details on that; where those came from, existing markets, some of these markets?
Scott Stubbs
So, I would tell you that they are similar markets to where we have been in the past. I mean theyâre all markets where we currently have properties, they range from Boston to Phoenix; so theyâre across the U.S. These are local developers, most of them we have relationships with. The majority of them, we feel like are going to be very good acquisitions and are -- as weâve underwritten them -- we have underwritten them with we would say certainly prudent, lease-up assumptions, meaning weâve kind of gone to our historical average. We recognize that the market wonât always be what is today. Some of these C of O deals are out into 2017, even out into 2018. And so we have been prudent in our underwriting assumptions and we expect them to perform well.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vikram Malhotra
I just had a kind of bigger picture question. You referenced that supply should not be an issue for the next couple of years. I think we were sourcing maybe 16, now maybe 17. You started off same-store NOI kind of in this 8% range and now clearly youâre 10% to 11%. Looking forward what are you sort of -- what metric would you say can continue at a very strong pace, if you were to sort of pick one and what are you most worried about?
Scott Stubbs
Vikram, itâs Scott. So, obviously we are not ready to give 2016 guidance, maybe just kind of commenting on where we are today and where we can kind of see things going. I would tell you weâve had a very good year. I think that we have had outstanding performance. If I look into the next year, I think itâs going to be very good. I think that our occupancy canât continue to have a 200 basis-point delta year-over-year; our discounts, we canât continue to push them lower year after year but I do think we will have some pricing power going into next year and it will be a very good year still.
Vikram Malhotra
And just one clarification, so, on that pricing power, you had very solid growth. Can you just sort of give us a bit more color what was the price increase in terms of street rates, how much they grew, and then the price increase to existing customers?
Scott Stubbs
Yes. So, our existing customers, we continue to increase them in the high single digit. In terms of the pricing, our prices to -- and Street rate, it depends on the time of the year. During the summer months we saw 8% growth. So, we continue to push on those. If you look at waterfall and where our growth came from, our growth came about just over 200 basis points in occupancy, about 50 basis points from discounts, and the rest came from rate, primarily from new customers coming in the door.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open
Todd Thomas
Just first question following up on rents and then price increases, if I think about your portfolio overall generating rental income growth of 10% in the quarter, some markets obviously well above that. Just given the churn you see in your portfolio and the time it takes to re-tenant space when customers move out, that suggests to me that you are increasing rents well above 10% across the portfolio. You just mentioned that you are increasing rents to existing customers in the high single digits and even in the peak season street rents were only up 8%. So, Iâm just sort of curious, what am I missing that the blended overall portfolio rental income growth in the quarter was 10%.
Scott Stubbs
One of the things that happened is we actually have some negative churn that takes place. So depending on the time of year, our negative churn is typically mid-single-digits but it could go higher than that, depending on what weâre doing with rates. So if someone moves in, in the summer where there are peak rates and then we drop the prices in the fall, if someone moves out, you have a negative churn. So thatâs one of the things that I would tell you, just in doing the simple math youâre missing. The other one is raising our existing customers high single digits but we did that last year. So year-over-year, itâs really not generating a lot of lift to our income.
Todd Thomas
I guess both of those actually sound like they be headwinds to rental income growth; is that right? Is that what youâre trying to say with that? So, if someone moves in, in the summer at a higher rent during the summer, then they move out and you replace that with someone in the fall or in the winter at a lower rent and same thing with sort of the net increase to existing customers, youâre saying that the churn causes that to be lower. But Iâm wondering how the blended overall rental income growth in the quarter was 10% when -- it doesnât seem like youâre increasing rents to anybody 10% or more. Street rates were up during the peak 8% and existing customer rent increases are less than 10%.
Scott Stubbs
So 200 basis points to 250 basis points on occupancy, you get a 0.5% of discount, so thatâs 3%. You then get the rest from rate. So, if youâre pushing your existing customerâs high single digits and you did that last year, maybe slightly more this year, you get a little bit from that. And then we pushed street rates this year 7% to 8%.
Todd Thomas
And then my second question just regarding the C of O deals, curious how big that pipeline will get. During the last cycle you had about $300 million development pipeline, obviously the size of the Company was much smaller and itâs much larger today, but just curious where you see that pipeline growing? Do you think youâll get back to $300 million or even higher?
Spencer Kirk
As you think about a C of O pipeline, the governor for us is dilution, and weâve set a target of about 3% of FFO as what weâre willing to tolerate. And depending on whether we do those C of O deals just by ourselves or with the JV partner can affect that calculation. So obviously, we would like to do nice new properties in as many core markets as we can. Itâs a competitive market and we have a dilution threshold that we want to be very disciplined, so that we donât go backwards.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Todd Stender
Can you provide some fundamental data points for the operating properties, or the one you acquired in Q3, you also have some under contract that youâre expecting to acquire in Q4, just seeing that these are stabilized and any details you can provide?
Spencer Kirk
Most of the properties weâre looking at stabilized cap rate in the mid-6s, your year one cap rate is usually going to be slightly below that. Some of these properties have a little bit of upside but not that significant.
Todd Stender
But occupancy or rental rates, anything, any context you can provide with those. 
Scott Stubbs
Itâs both. And it will depend a little bit on the properties. So for instance that one we bought in the quarter had more rate growth potential as well as a little bit of occupancy, going forward, some of the other properties weâre looking at buying have a combination of rate and occupancy and then others just have rate growth for opportunities.
Todd Stender
Thatâs helpful, Scott. And then -- go ahead, sorry. 
Scott Stubbs
I said it really depends on the property and the market.
Todd Stender
And just switching gears to the third party management. We used to talk about it a lot more often, it seems like itâs been overshadowed by your good fundamentals, definitely youâre entering into C of O deals. Just wanted to get a sense of how much the third-party management pipeline that provides you guys with acquisition opportunities; how much of that is still in place?
Spencer Kirk
It still is the prime reason weâre in the business, Todd, to create off market acquisition pipeline. We havenât made a lot of noise about it, but we added 43 managed assets on the SmartStop acquisition, and by the end of the year, weâll have grown that pool by more than a 100 assets. So for us, the strategic opportunity that it presents and we continue to buy from that portfolio that we manage. We also get economies of scale and the tenant insurance, and the power of spending more on the internet in those respective markets. So, it continues to be a very important part of our business.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. 
George Hoglund
I just had one question on the outperformance relative to the peers on a same-store NOI basis. I mean itâs been pretty substantial this year. Iâm just wondering what do you guys think the driver of that is. I know a part of it can be just how you guys determine the same-store pool relative to the peers, but what also you attribute your outperformance to?
Scott Stubbs
Itâs tough to comment on their results. I would tell you weâve put information in our supplementals, breaking out our current pool versus our last yearâs pool. But I would tell you, both pools have performed. I think that weâd like to think that we have the best mousetrap out there that we have -- weâre most aggressive on the internet, we have the best revenue management systems. But itâs tough to comment on how we compare to them.
Spencer Kirk
George, itâs Spencer, if I could just make a comment, because this continues to come up. We have not changed our same-store definition in over a decade. Weâve been consistent. And I can tell you in Q3, the same-store properties that have been added in which were not primarily lease-up, but rather just properties that we acquired, provided an uplift of 80 basis points on revenue and 110 basis points on the NOI. So, if you subtract that out weâre still very pleased with what our properties are producing, our platform enables us to do, and probably most importantly what our team is executing on. I think itâs a combination of people, platform and properties that have allowed us to produce the results that weâve produced.
Todd Stender
And then just one more, in terms of markets where you may be seeing -- or are you seeing in any markets somewhat of a pushback on the rates where you may be seeing a little bit more of occupancy decline or are you really seeing that anywhere?
Scott Stubbs
So, even our worst markets weâre still seeing 5% growth. So, I think that itâs healthy across the U.S. Markets are somewhat cyclical, some are better than others. I would tell you, our worst markets are probably Chicago and maybe Washington D.C. but theyâve been very strong in past years and theyâre still experiencing 5% growth.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open. 
Ki Bin Kim
So, maybe looking forward, not asking for guidance but we look at the same-store revenue composition this quarter is around 10% and you said 250 came from occupancy and lower promotions. If we assume that doesnât happen again, just on a go forward basis, what are the couple of factors that you look at to fee -- can you just go to 7.5 or is that pretty much how we hit the feeling in terms of growth rate and maybe what has to happen in the economy or population or own prices or things like that that can change that, move that needle positive or negative on that number?
Spencer Kirk
First of all, we will push rate on both existing and new customers as hard as we can. We donât want to get ahead of ourselves. There might be another 100 basis points on occupancy. The overall health of the economy obviously will be a big determinant. But as we look at 2016, as Scott said, our expectation is our results are going to go from phenomenal to maybe just really good. And weâll have to see how the year transpires. But I donât see any disruptive element on the horizon with regards to new supply for the next couple of years which I already commented on. And I only see us getting more powerful and potent in the digital world, particularly with our mobile strategy. And weâre going to continue to invest wisely and weâre going to do everything we can to drive optimal performance from these assets.
Ki Bin Kim
Have you seen any notable change in customer move out activity based on the rental rates that youâre pushing through from previous cycle?
Spencer Kirk
No, sir.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Steve Rowe [ph] with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
I wanted to ask you -- I know youâve mentioned a couple of times that you donât see new supply as a big issue over the next couple of years. But when you look at -- just sort of basing this on some commentary from some brokers weâve spoken to that itâs actually harder to get lending for new supply in smaller markets than it is for bigger markets. I was just wondering if you see that at all and maybe just the tenure of lending in general of the space as people try to. I would think there got to be a fair amount of capital but looking to get into this industry and for some reason itâs not able to be put to work and just wondering if you can maybe talk about what youâre seeing on the ground level?
Scott Stubbs
From what weâre seeing, itâs hard to comment a lot on financing just because weâre not out there looking for it. I think well capitalized developers are going to be able to get loans, obviously better markets, itâs going to be better but it also probably affects your returns. Your returns in New York City are going to be less than your returns in Dallas you would expect. The other thing thatâs happening is land prices, I think our pricing some people out of certain markets we have not seen anything substantial out of Southern California, out of San Francisco, out of Seattle, some of these markets where itâs difficult, everybody is competing for the same piece of land. So from our perspective, we are seeing some new construction. Itâs more in the markets like Denver, Dallas, Atlanta, South Florida, even some in New York City, but from our perspective, we donât see it across the whole U.S., we see certain pockets with some. And we do expect it to come with the returns of the properties. But Iâm not sure itâs going to be a tighter wave of new construction.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then can you just talk about the average length of stay; is that continuing to lengthen out?
Spencer Kirk
Itâs about the same, there might be a very, very slight uptick on the length of stay, but itâs in very stable suite.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Mehta with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
Gaurav Mehta
Yes, thank you good afternoon. Just a quick one on the lease-up period. You have a few stores that are in their operations now. I was hoping if you can comment on the impact of technology that youâre seeing on the time itâs taking to lease-up those stores?
Scott Stubbs
So, we are seeing quicker lease-ups at our C of O stores. Itâs probably a combination of technology as well as no new supply. In our supplemental package, page 23, we show the details and kind of where the occupancy is for those stores. We are doing tests on our store to see if you can move the needle in terms of marketing spend, in terms of rates, but overall typically, weâre going to go into the market with lower prices and try to be as aggressive as we can to fill them up as quickly as possible.
Gaurav Mehta
Okay. And following up on the construction financing, is that the only reason you are seeing an increased interest from merchant builders and other developers to bring C of O deals to you guys, the lack of constructing financing or something else going as well?
Scott Stubbs
So with them bringing C of O deals to us, clearly they are getting some type of financing in the interim. Iâm guessing most of them have some type of construction loan and then potentially this helps as far as the takeout. The other thing thatâs changed in todayâs cycle for a lot of these developers is it used to be that they would build the property, theyâd open it up, theyâd take out a yellow page, theyâd operate it themselves. I think with the sophistication now of the larger players, thatâs becoming more and more difficult. Itâs difficult to compete on the internet for a small operator. Many of them are coming to the big players to have them manage those properties or at least sell them at C of O.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.
John Pawlowski
Thank you. The 19 Harrison Street properties saw outsized acceleration of revenue and NOI growth this quarter, could you provide some color on what drove this and whether anything has changed operationally now that these are wholly-owned?
Scott Stubbs
Nothing is changed operationally; I would tell you itâs just timing on those properties. There is nothing significant thatâs changed if I recall right. I think those properties revenue wise are operating very similar to many of our existing properties.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Jonathan Hughes
Looking at 61 [ph] stores that are added to same-store, you may well increase NOI there by pretty impressive amount this year, I something well ahead of 20% the first nine months. Could you just talk about the contribution from those assets versus the 50 basis points guidance at the beginning of the year, and then maybe looking ahead could we expect the similar boost from those properties that get added next year?
Scott Stubbs
So, if you look at page 18 of our supplemental that actually compares the last yearâs 442 pool to this yearâs 503. And in the third quarter, they had it 80 basis points to change in pool and then 100 basis points year-to-date. I would tell you that that is a little bit of anomaly. I think that we would expect a small bump from next yearâs changing pool but nothing like weâve seen this year.
Jonathan Hughes
And then lastly kind of a broader question, I am anxious to hear your thoughts about [indiscernible] on-demand storage services in some urban markets like New York, Boston and D.C., do you see these as competitors to your business, or do you see them as complementary where they may actually in rent units facilities you currently own the store there been?
Spencer Kirk
Lots of questions in there Jonathan, [indiscernible] service, itâs obviously something weâre looking at. Right now Iâm aware of several dozen players that are all buying to prove this product concept. One of the things that I do know is with over 1300 stores scattered across the U.S., weâre in a really good position to be part of the solution. And this is one where we are keeping our options open, seeing how things kind of shake out. Weâve had numerous discussions and itâs something that is being incubated. Now whether it turns out to be a significant part of -- what happens when people looking for a solution for storage, only time will tell. But I can tell you, itâs not something that we are ignoring, we are very keenly interested in the urban markets, where you have small units in these major markets. And we think that it could have a place, but the piece of this is much like the pick-up and delivery service of years gone by. There is a huge logistical component to it. Real estate is part of the solution but itâs not the entire solution. And weâre going to have to be very thoughtful. And as I said, keep our options open but yes weâve been exploring it and trying to understand what the implications might mean for our core market. Today, it is de minimis, it is insignificant and it is not impacting our business as our results would indicate it.
Jonathan Hughes
Have any of them approached to you maybe try and team up and come up with a solution orâ¦?
Spencer Kirk
Weâre just keeping all options open Jonathan.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Paul Adornato
Most of my questions have been answered, but I was wondering if you could share with us perhaps whatâs on your plate in terms of R&D; whatâs kind of net out there? And while weâre on the topic, can you talk about your new mobile app and some of the features there?
Spencer Kirk
So, in terms of R&D, Paul, Iâm not at liberty to talk about what weâre cooking in the kitchen, weâll bring that when weâre prepared. Mobile, itâs really interesting. I think on April 21st of this year where Google changed the algorithm, itâs called Mobilegeddon. I think our team perhaps as much as a year in advance started working on mobile strategy. And the mobile strategy definitely favors those that actually own the real estate, especially when you look at the maps. The Mobilegeddon piece was the algorithmic change at Google, favorite sites that were mobile friendly. And what I can tell is you mobile has become the leading search device that eclipsed desktop and laptop and itâs a core strategic advantage of this Company. I donât believe that the smaller operators have the resources to throw at the mobile platform what we and the other national storage operators have been able to do. And I think this is once again the internet creating a landscape of the haves and haves not. And that chasm is widening and the rate at which that chasm is widening is accelerating. And I think weâre in the great position with the other storage REITs, a great time to be a large national operator. 
Paul Adornato
And while weâre on the topic what is the cut off or did you consider those four or maybe five public operators as large enough or are some of those $1 billion portfolios large enough to enjoy some of these benefits?
Spencer Kirk
It depends on the company and their commitment to technology. Theyâre regional players that are very sophisticated and doing a great job, but once again it ultimately comes down to how many dollars you have to spend on your mobile strategy. And size and scale are decided advantage in the allocation.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Todd Thomas
With regard to the exclusive you have in managing new acquisitions for strategic, is that an option like a ROFO where you say yes, weâll manage the property or is it something that as they acquire, youâre required to manage those properties regardless of where it is and how close it might be to your existing properties or whether or not itâs in markets where youâre concentrated?
Spencer Kirk
Weâre going to take them all Todd. And quite frankly the more properties we have in the market, the more power we have in that market. And I would much rather have an asset in close proximity to one of our assets that we control pricing and promotion than having it be in the hands of someone that may not be rational in their behavior.
Todd Thomas
And then just one quick follow-up on the mobile technology. How much of your rental demand is sourced from mobile today and where was that last year?
Spencer Kirk
More than 50% last year was probably 30%. So, the rate of growth is tremendous. And the impact on our business is significant. And weâre really pleased that weâre ahead of the path.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. 
Wes Golladay
Sticking with topics such as the structural barriers and Mobilegeddon, are you seeing developers just growing the talent out and what is the development pool like versus the last cycle?
Spencer Kirk
First of all last cycle on average through to mid-2,000s, Wes, it was more than 2,600 properties per year being put into the marketplace. Today depending on whose number you want to use, weâre 20% 30% of that number. And for us, I think that there is a growing awareness, the smaller operators and would be developers that they have the advantage in the local markets when it comes to connections and maybe getting a deal done but they cannot compete because we are not in the world of yellow pages anymore. Weâre in the land of digital real estate. And they are recognizing that donât have a sophistication over the dollars to even attempt to compete against the REITs. So yes, I think many, many folks out there are throwing into tail and that that is going to continue to accelerate.

And then you mentioned Denver, Dallas have been markets for supply on the horizon but all of these markets are economically full. Would you expect the initial round of supply to be absorbed by the pent up demand or is there any markets that concern you with the first round of supply?
Spencer Kirk
I think there was quite a dearth of supply, Wes, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and I think that the supply thatâs been put into those markets is largely fixing the pent up problem. So we feel comfortable with the supply issue for the next couple of years, as Iâve said a couple of times today.

And then lastly, you guys have a lot good consumer data, the economy appears to be softening a little bit at the margin. Are you seeing anything in your dataset that is at least the yellow flag for you the moment?
Spencer Kirk
Not sir.
