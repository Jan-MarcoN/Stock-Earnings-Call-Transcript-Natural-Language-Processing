Good morning and welcome to Starwood Hotels & Resorts' Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
I would now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen Pettibone
Thank you Sylvia and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Frits van Paasschen, our CEO and President, Tom Mangas, our CFO and Executive Vice President and Matt Avril who following the completion of the spinoff of our timeshare business is expected to become CEO of the new company. With both fourth quarter earnings and the SPO spin to cover, we're going to extend the call to about for 45 minutes of Q&A following our prepared remarks.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.
The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Starwood's Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com.
With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Frits for his comments.
Frits van Paasschen
Thank you, Stephen. We're delighted to have all of you join us. For today's Q4 earnings call, we'll follow the usual format with both Tom and my prepared remarks. This will include a look back on 2014 as well as our outlook for 2015. On top of that, we'll provide some further color on our plan to spin-off our vacation ownership business. 
So let's get started with a look at the 2014 performance. If you go back to our Q4 call from a year ago, we said that the global economy has seen a string of four similar years in a row. And from a macro standpoint easier to re-characterize by a slow but continuing recovery with its fair share of regional fits and starts. Our outlook for 2014 was for more of same and that's more or less how it's played out. The long-term drivers demand growth for global travel and for high end lodging brands remained firmly in place. At our hotels occupancies continue to rise even as we expand our footprint. Our major corporate clients continue to tell us that they'll be traveling more. Airports around the world are reporting record numbers of passenger traffic from LA to Frankfurt to Beijing to Singapore. In 2014, Dubai's airport became the world's busiest. You might recall that Dubai is the city with the most Starwood hotels outside of New York and the home of our partner Emirates Airlines.
International air traffic to and from the U.S. in 2014 was up 7% reaching all time record levels, behind that growth there were encouraging indicators of demand from healthy U.S. GDP figures to low end employment. We saw bright spots in other markets as well such as Mexico and Indonesia where our hotels had strong RevPAR growth. In India, Prime Minister Modi's administration has brought a fresh focus on business generally and on tourism in particular making this a great time to relocate our global headquarters to the subcontinent for the month of March and even as China's growth slowed to 7% its total incremental GDP will be about the same as U.S. incremental GDP.
Of course 2014 was not without its challenges, a stronger U.S. dollar highlights not only global uncertainty but it also creates a headwind for our own P&L. Most of that uncertainty is centered on two regions, the Middle-East given recent conflicts and Europe with Russia, Ukraine and Greece not to mention euro zone deflation.
So 2015 started with a backdrop of volatility in currencies and commodities as well as the collapse of the Russian economy. But most indicators suggest that even if this year's different from the past the global recovery will continue for a few more years. Our performance in 2014 neared the macro environment and it turned out to be a very solid year for Starwood. RevPAR was up nearly 6% for 2014 right in the middle of the guidance range that we set out a year ago. As we expected North America was our strongest region with RevPAR up 7% and Q4 marked our seventh straight quarter of record high occupancy.
Group business continue to strengthen and the year saw an uptick in the volumes of near term smaller meetings building on the trend that we've seen for a while. The supply picture remains relatively benign, that is, not enough new supply to bring occupancies down. We're seeing more construction activity in the Select Serve segment but almost no industry supply growth in the upper upscale and luxury segment. Against the backdrop of low oil prices and low interest rates, we see potential for the North America recovery cycle to continue to for some time.
In China 2014 RevPAR was up over 8% excluding Macau a little over 4%. Occupancy was up 480 basis points to 61%, RevPAR index was up once again as well. China now accounts for 14% of our fees more than 15% of our footprint and about a third of our pipeline. And even as China's GDP numbers moderate, we're seeing rising demand for our brand. Our active SPG member base is now nearly four times what it was four years ago and outbound travel from China to our hotels was up nearly 20% in 2014.
Looking back, China's economy is more than two times as big in 2014 as when I joined in 2007 and by 2018 its economy is projected to be another 40% larger, which is why we maintained a view that despite any near term challenges, there is more risk in staying on the sidelines in China than in pursuing that to grow. 
Turning to Latin America, RevPAR was up over 3%. Mexico led the region with RevPAR growth of about 20%. Brazil and Argentina continue to struggle, so despite a lift from the World Cup our results in back half of 2014 reflect the ill of the South American economy. 
For 2015, one can hope that the post-election government in Brazil will take steps to restart the economic growth, with Argentina looks to be more of the same. Despite these macro issues in both countries, our business is held up relatively well. Our hotels have significantly outperformed their competitors, which speaks to the strength of our brands and our distribution.
In Europe despite the uncertainty the performance at our hotels improved in the second half of 2014. Full year RevPAR was up over 3%. Spain and Greece bounced back in the year. Business in Germany picked up through the year. Looking ahead, Europe situation is still unclear but most forecasts call for modest growth. Bank lending standards are easing and the ECB quantitative easing might help at least from so far as a weaker euro will bring more U.S. tourists to Europe, but to be sure we're not factoring in a robust recovery for the European business in 2015.
RevPAR in the Middle-East and Africa grew 2.4% and our Asia-Pacific markets outside of China grew almost 3% in both regions geopolitical events were a drag on business and these regions are likely to be a mixed bag in 2015 as well. Some markets, Thailand for example are showing a pickup in both transient and group business. Other areas like the resource rich economies in Africa are being held back by commodity prices. 
Driving our RevPAR growth in 2014 was another year of rise in RevPAR index in other words our hotels in aggregate around the world outperformed their competitors' stat. We're driving revenues through our efforts to connect better with guests and customers. We built up our ability to help our associates on property at customer contact centers and in our sales organization. As a result, they can deliver better experiences and better target our customers. Along these lines for example, we have better systems in revenue management, big data offer engines, web channels and account information.
Driven by RevPAR, our core fees grew nearly 7%. SG&A for the year came in just under 5% at the high-end of our initial guidance range, but lower than we expected at the time of our Q3 call. Based on these results along with the strong performance at our owned hotels and SPO, we delivered adjusted-EBITDA of 1.24 billion above the high-end of expectations laid out at the beginning of the year. 
In 2014, we opened 15,000 rooms around the world, this includes our 200 Westin which was a milestone for the brand and all over 60% of the rooms that entered our system in 2014 were high end property either luxury or upper upscale and more than 85% were located outside of the U.S. This means on a per room basis, that they'll generate higher fees. 
As of the start of 2015, our hotels outside the U.S. account for 56% of our global footprint up another 2% from last year. In 2014, we signed deals for 175 new hotels representing about 35,000 rooms and about 10% of our current footprint. Nonetheless our net rooms growth during the year was only 2% which is below our target of 4% to 5%. 
As we mentioned on recent calls, this was driven by three factors. Longer development times and important growth markets like China, fewer in the year for the year conversions and a higher proportion of Select Serve hotels with lower average room count. To be sure, we're taking action to get ourselves back on our growth trajectory. Already in 2014, we had our second best signing year ever, in fact we signed a 100 more hotels and we opened which bodes well for future growth. 
We've also put in place resources to support even more deals in the years ahead. In the vein of getting feet on the street, we've added local deal executives to support growth markets and in the U.S. to support growth segments. We streamline our process for converting hotels to our brand and we're selectively using our balance sheet to catalyze development as well as finding new ways to bring hotels into our system. 
Along those lines and building on the 20 years of experience for luxury collection as well as the systems improvements that we've made in recent years, we're now planning to launch a collection brand that will fit the wide space that lies between luxury collection and design hotels. This new offering will allow us to plug-in unbranded properties that meet the quality expectations of our core SPG travelers and broaden our ability to grow and reaching even broader segment of travelers. 
Right now the U.S. is certainly the strongest lodging market for branded growth, particularly in the Select Serve segment. We've been working hard to ensure that our brands resonate with U.S. consumers and developers.
Take Aloft, its footprint is up over 15% over last year and we plan to open our 100th property in 2015. Aloft, along with W and Element, will be the first hotel brand to have keyless check-in installed every property around the world. Aloft appeals to young tech savvy travelers and these travelers are increasingly drawn to SPG which accounts for half of its occupants. Aloft's rise in RevPAR is a testament to that loyalty as well with the Aloft rates already on par with major select brands.
We've recently seen transactions of Aloft selling at prices well above their construction costs. All of this explains why last year our Aloft signings in North America were the highest since before the crisis another growth accelerator for us is Element this past year in fact we signed more deals for Element that we have open properties. We also signed a record number of Four Points by Sheraton in 2014 Four Points is our second largest brand by rooms in our development pipeline and we're on track to open our 200 Four Points by Sheraton this year.
So this is how we intend to accelerate our growth in North America but at the same time we view our global geographic mix as a long-term strength the trend lines tell us that we're well positioned as the leader in markets where another billion people will move to cities in the coming 20 years.
So let me turn now to capital allocation. In 2014 we returned $2.4 billion in cash to shareholders and reduced our share count by over 10%. These returns were funded through a combination of operating cash flow increasing our leverage to target levels and though asset sales. 
Specifically on that last point we sold eight hotels for total proceeds of about 800 million. Tom will show you more details on our plans for capital allocation in 2015 and for our return of cash but I wanted to mention a few points. We expect to stay at or near our target debt levels which is where we find ourselves now.
You've also seen that we have declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.375 a share our board has also approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization by 750 million. This brings me to a discussion of our plans to spin off our vacation ownership business. Through this transaction we expect to create a pure play vacation ownership company with a seasoned management team, a strong balance sheet that set to pursue growth at the same time the transaction will accelerate Starwood's asset light transformation.
One question you might ask is whether we're turning away from the timeshare business the reality is that we continue to believe in this business and in the value of our brands to lead the industry put simply through this spin off we are no more exiting the timeshare business than we are exiting the hotel business when we sell hotels with long term contracts and just like selling hotels we're converting Starwood's participation in vacation ownership to an asset light fee based business model. The strength of our brands and the SPG platform will fuel growth and shareholder value for both companies.
You may also ask about the timing of the spin off, why now? First of all capital markets currently provide great valuations for spin offs in general and timeshare in particular. Second, this has been a strong business for Starwood in terms of cash generation to the tune of over $1 billion over the past six years. As we look ahead in our core markets Hawaii, Mexico and Orlando, we see that this business can do more than replenish inventory it can drive significant growth.
In Mexico for example demand for our vacation ownership properties has led these sales beyond our expectations the Westin St. John has sown that we can successfully convert hotels to timeshare and demand for our inventory now points to a great opportunity in Hawaii for their next phase in Ka'anapali.
These investments make perfect sense for the timeshare business but they don't naturally fit with the capital return profile of a global fee based business at the center of Starwood's strategy. All of this tells us that this is the right time to let our vacation ownership business to pursue that growth on its own. As a standalone entity the new company is positioned to have direct access to dedicated capital it comes in market with a great business leading brands, a best in class team, a platform with scale and a long history of success.
In the past 30 years it's sold some $6 billion in units at some of the highest unit prices. Looking ahead the new company will have a clear plan for growth so splitting Starwood and SVO will enable shareholders to invest in two pure play propositions. And look at the shareholder basis for existing timeshare companies suggests the new company will attract a different shareholder base than that of Starwood shareholders with a greater appetite to invest in this kind of growth and as a foundation for that growth we expect to place five hotels with the new company. These properties are in key timeshare locations and will provide a ready source for new inventory.
And from Starwood's perspective we reduced our owned hotel count moving us further towards our asset light goals while at the same time putting these five properties in the hands of a long term partner and we intend for that partnership to take the form of an arm's-length agreement with Starwood including an SPG affiliation and licensing agreements for the timeshare business. The company as well as its owners with timeshare intervals will retain an affiliation with the Westin and Sheraton brand and through SPG access to our global network of high end hotels.
Our goal is to create a long term relationship that ensures no disruption or change for timeshare owners and also ensures long term protection of Starwood's brand. Leading the company will be Matt Avril. We're delighted to have a leader for this business who knows us and knows our brands that brings energy, experience and expertise in the timeshare business. You may recognize Matt as the former senior member of Starwood's leadership team who until the 2012 was President of our hotel group overseeing all of our hotel operations worldwide. He spent over 25 years in the timeshare business. Now Matt will return as Chief Executive Officer of the new Company joining Steve Williams SVO's Chief Operating Officer to lead this terrific team of associates. 
And this leads me to a point it doesn't stand-out on SVO's balance sheet, but in my opinion is arguably its greatest asset. SVO has a great culture, year in year out the associate engagement stores are among the highest in Starwood. This culture and the talent that goes along with it have made great results in both sales with industry leading margins and in guest service with guest satisfaction scores to prove it. It's also why our 60% of our buyers are existing owners of our timeshare intervals. These 220,000 owners are SVO's biggest fans.
In summary, I'm very proud of our vacation ownership team and how it succeeded through the year. There's a lot of work to do between now and the planned spinoff but from a position of strength we're confident that this is the right step at the right time for both Starwood and the new company.
Before closing my prepared remarks, I want to comment on our progress towards asset light. We expect that following the spinoff we will end 2015 with about 75% of EBITDA before SG&A from fees even without the additional asset sales that we expect in 2014 -- I mean that we would expect to be at 2014 level. Tom will give you more details on our outlook for asset sales in 2015, but as we approach our goal of the $3 billion in asset sales by the end of 2016 as we laid out at our Dubai Investor Day, we expect to be well above our 80% asset light target.
And with that, I'm pleased to hand the call over to Tom.
Tom Mangas
Thank you Frits. Good morning and thanks for joining us on the call. Given that Frits gave a thorough review of the year, I'll focus my remarks on the final quarter of 2014. I will then share our guidance for 2015 and the first quarter and will give specifics on our return of capital plans and the vacation ownership spend.
In the quarter, worldwide system-wide RevPAR for same-store sales grew 4.4% in constant dollars and 2.3% when accounting for foreign exchange impacts. This was consistent with our expectations going into the quarter. This allowed us to deliver fee growth from management, franchise and other fee income of 10.9% and core fee growth of 3.7% compared to last year. These fee growth rates were reduced by roughly 200 basis points due to the impact of foreign exchange.
Our fee growth and good SG&A cost control allowed us to deliver adjusted-EBITDA of $335 million ahead of our guidance range of $310 million to $320 million an almost 7% increase over the prior year. These results combined with our share repurchase activity and favorable effective tax rate powered our adjusted earnings per share to $0.97 a 33% increase over the prior year.
Not surprisingly, North America led the growth with RevPAR growth of 5.8% in constant dollars. RevPAR in the South and West regions were strong up 8% and 9% respectively. However, our heavier mix of business in the North region and New York in particular with its large supply increase muted our performance. Hawaii continued to be a challenge for us in the phase of lower demand from Japan due to the weaker yen. We are remixing the business there by increasing our focus on inbound travel from mainland U.S. We saw good results in Hawaii in December, so we are hopeful that we will see more growth there in 2015.
Overall for North America our average daily rate was up 3.4% and our occupancy was up 160 basis points. Group business continues to get better and we had an incredibly strong bookings in the quarter with group revenue up over 9% for business into all future years. We had a double-digit increase in the revenue we booked in the quarter for the quarter and December was the largest group booking month in our company's history.
Our pace numbers are growing strongly reflecting that trend and currently have got over 7% of our 2015 expected business on the books. On the transient front, we're making progress in the corporate rate negotiation process and with nearly 60% of the bids in we expect rates will be up in the mid-single digits on average.
Latin America RevPAR was up 2.8%. Mexico continues to drive the region in both in Mexico City and in our coastal resorts. Importantly, we grew share in South America despite some volatile markets. Greater China and Europe both saw RevPAR growth at or above 4% in constant dollars despite slowing conditions there. While FX was only a slight headwind to greater China, Europe saw actual RevPAR decline 3.3%. 
In Europe we saw average daily rate up 1% and occupancy was up 200 basis points. The recent Greece and southern Europe saw good recoveries of a weak 2014 base. Germany powered along with RevPAR growth of 5% and the UK enjoyed 3% RevPAR growth. France was essentially flat.
The decline in Russia inbound travel to the Africa and Middle-East regions, especially Dubai, due to the weak ruble contribute to RevPAR declines of 30 basis points in our Africa, Middle-East region. For the Africa, Middle-East region, average daily rate was down 1.5% but occupancy increased 70 basis points.
Greater China saw average daily rate declines of 1% offset by occupancy up 320 basis points, largely driven by the continued ramp up of the Sheraton Macau. RevPAR in mainland China was up 2.8%. Performance continued to be impacted by the government austerity program and supply growth put pressure on rate and occupancy in some markets. Performance in the north of China remained weak but the east especially Shanghai continued their strong performance with RevPAR up over 7%. 
In Asia Pacific outside of greater China RevPAR grew 1.2%, with strong gains in Australia, Fiji, India and Japan offset by continued weakness in Malaysia, Indonesia which had a sizable APEC event in the prior year and lower inbound Russian travel and key resort markets in Indonesia, Thailand and Maldives. 
Worldwide all our brands grew RevPAR in the quarter in constant dollar terms, Aloft RevPAR grew 8.7% as this brand continues to build momentum domestically and internationally growing occupancy 300 basis points. Both the Westin and St. Regis brands delivered RevPAR growth above 5%, Le MÃ©ridien have the weakest RevPAR growth across our brands driven largely by geographic mix as this brand has a heavy footprint in Africa, Middle East and Asia. 
Turning to our owned and leased portfolio, after busy year of asset disposals we currently own or lease 36 hotels and resorts. 13 are in North America, 12 are in Europe, 8 are in Latin America and remaining 3 are in Asia Pacific. These numbers include the five properties we plan to contribute on a vacation ownership spend. I will cover that in more detail later. 
For the quarter RevPAR for the same store owned hotels increased 4.7% and revenue for these hotels was $370 million, a decline from the same period in 2013 driven by our aggressive asset sale program and impact of foreign exchange. 
The vacation ownership business saw revenues increase 15% to $167 million driven largely by recognition of previously deferred revenues from the sales at Westin St. John. Originated contract sales of vacation ownership intervals declined 2% due to lower average prices partially offset by higher contract signings. SG&A for the quarter increased just under 3% versus the prior year to $109 million. Total year SG&A growth was at the low-end of our revised range at just under 5% as we delivered strong cost control in the final quarter. 
In this quarter we closed on six hotel dispositions including our Sheraton on the park property, this St. Regis Rome, the Sheraton Ambassador and the Philadelphia Triplex. Total asset sales yielded gross proceeds of $585 million in the quarter. For the year we enjoyed gross proceeds of $817 million so a big quarter towards our asset light strategy.
Looking back at the hotels we sold over the past two years our total tax cost has been less than 10%, although there maybe transactions where we have a larger tax impact in the future we believe that on the aggregate basis we will be able to continue to sell our hotels at this level of tax efficiency going forward. Turning to return of capital on the balance sheet as Frits mentioned we continue to be active buying back stock in the fourth quarter. In total we purchased 7.8 million shares or $609 million; we also paid total dividends of $173 million including the last of the four special dividends from the Bal Harbour sale.
With these actions and the cash generated by asset sales and the operations we took net-debt-to-EBITDA to 1.4 times on a straight basis or 2.9 times based on how SMP calculated which again excludes our foreign cash and includes adjustments they make for operating leases and other smaller items. 
Net we reached the high-end of our leverage target by the end of the quarter. Gross debt on the books is $2.7 billion; net debt was $1.7 billion excluding the debt and restricted cash associated with the securitized vacation ownership receivables. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion thanks a large parts of the proceeds on the asset sales we completed in the fourth quarter, of that amount approximately $950 million was located offshore. In February we paid down our commercial paper balance by roughly $400 million using cash on hand. 
Now let me turn to guidance for the year and for the first quarter. First, we expect system wide RevPAR to grow 5.7% in 2015 in local currency. This is different from the company operated guidance range we gave last quarter for two reasons. First it now includes our expectations for franchise properties and second reflects an improved outlook for the U.S. and in parts of Asia Pacific. If current FX rates this will reduce U.S. dollar RevPAR by roughly 300 basis points for the year. 
Similarly core fees should grow 8% to 10% again in constant dollars. The U.S. dollar fee growth will see a similar 300 basis points reduction. Our reported fee growth is expected to grow 2% to 4% driven by both FX headwind and roughly $35 million of above normal termination and other one-time fees in 2014 most of which we highlighted last quarter. 
We expect to grow SG&A 2% to 4% following last year's 5% growth rate. We expect our owned hotel margins to increase 25 basis points to 75 basis points. As we continue to shrink our own portfolio improvement in margins becomes very property driven in 2015 our owned properties in Argentina are suppressing companywide owned margin growth given the different rate of change in local inflation versus the official exchange rate of Argentinian peso. Owned EBITDA will be lower by approximately $42 million due to hotels we sold in 2014. We project our vacation ownership in residential segment generate $140 million to $150 million of EBITDA. As we said in the past, we've managed business for good internal rates return not to grow earnings.
In 2015, the lower EBITDA versus 2014 is largely due to our lack in the sellout of Bal Harbour and the impact to deferred revenue on the percentage of completion accounting as we ramp up the investment in new inventory. All together, these results will enable us to deliver total adjusted EBITDA of $1.175 billion to $1.200 billion. This range reflects current foreign exchange rates which are reducing EBITDA by roughly $35 million compared to 2014. We also expect cash taxes to be $110 million and our full year normalized effective tax rate to be 32%.
We expect interest expense to be $135 million. We expect this to yield adjusted full-year earnings per share of $2.87 to $2.97 before incremental share repurchases. As a result, we are projecting cash flow from operations of $700 million to $800 million, or $860 million to $960 million before investment -- additional investment in timeshare inventory.
In total we expect to invest approximately $560 million in capital in the year behind net rooms growth on IT infrastructure and innovation on owned hotel maintenance capital and on timeshare inventory including projects like the KOR 3 project at Ka'anapali that Frits mentioned. 
This level is about 25% higher than the average in past three years mostly driven by the big KOR 3 investment. For the quarter, we're projecting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $250 million to $260 million driven by 4% to 6% constant dollar RevPAR growth, reflecting the current FX environment, the RevPAR range be more like 1% to 3% in actual dollars. This will result in core fee growth of 3% to 5%. Total management fees, franchise fees and other income will be flat due to large onetime fee in the prior year. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be $0.53 to $0.57.
Now turning back to the spinoff announcement. I would like to cover some details in the expected transaction. The transaction, which is expected to be tax-free to shareholders and will be affected through a pro rata distribution of the new entity's stock to existing Starwood's shareholders will create a premier upper scale timeshare company uniquely positioned for growth with a clear inventory strategy. Under this strategy, we expect that the new company will continue to focus on adding inventory at existing properties and with land available for development at many of the 22 resorts that currently operates, is well positioned to grow from that existing base.
To allow the new company to increase the scale, fuel sales, distribution add additional inventory, Starwood expects to contribute five of its own properties, Westin Los Cabos, Westin Cancun, Westin Puerta Vallarta, Sheraton Kauai and Sheraton Steamboat to the new company with the intention that the hotels will be sources of future timeshare inventory. We carefully analyzed the best uses for all our properties and believe these properties are best positioned for timeshare conversions. In addition SVO currently plans to begin construction of a new timeshare resort complex adjacent towards existing Westin Ka'anapali Ocean Resort in Maui.
This is a tremendous opportunity to add high quality Ocean front inventory when rate time share markets and it's one where we've already done the rate returns on a first two Ka'anapali projects. We're including capital related to this project in 2015 of approximately $80 million in our development capital guidance. As Frits mentioned, we intend for the new company to enter into long term agreements with Starwood related to the ongoing relationship between the two companies.
Once we've finalized those agreements, we can share the key terms with you but at a high level our expectation is that a license agreement will provide an annual fee to Starwood consisting of meaningful fixed base fee and a variable fee based on overall vacation ownership interest sales. We also expect that the agreements will provide that existing and future owners of Starwood branded vacation intervals receive similar services and benefits as they do today, including access to SPG.
At this time we believe the pro-forma impact of Starwood will include removing $140 million to $150 million of vacation ownership EBITDA and approximately $20 million of EBITDA from the 5 hotels we intend to contribute to the new company offset by the new annual license fee which we expect to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. SVO's G&A already captured in its direct expenses so we're not guiding any specific change to Starwood's G&A expense as a result of the transaction but we continue to look for ways to remove stranded costs and drive a competitive cost structure.
We would expect some incremental public company cost -- public company at the new company but it is too early to give you an estimate of what those would be. We expect to incur transaction related expenses during the year but we're not including them in our adjusted EBITDA guidance. We expect to give you more color on these later in the year. From a balance sheet perspective, we're still working to determine what the appropriate level of leverage to the new company will be although we assume at a minimum any receivables associated with the vacation ownership and corresponding debt would be part of the new company.
We'll disclose additional financial information regarding the transaction upon the filing of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC, which we expect to be in the position to file sometime in the second quarter. Until then, it won't be appropriate to provide specific details, including how we're thinking about the capital structure for the company along with other items such as the name of the of new timeshare company and further information regarding the board of directors and full management team.
I want to address a few more related items our progress towards asset light and how this transaction fits with our strategy, our view on asset sales and reaching our $3 billion goal by the end of 2016 and last what you can expect from a return of capital from Starwood in 2015.
While we've talked about our 80-20 asset light goal for many years in early 2013 we set out a target of reaching that goal by the end of 2016, completion of our vacation ownership spin off will mean that we will reach our 80-20 asset light goals slightly earlier than we had anticipated. But we also said in 2013 that reaching our goal would mean that we could generate approximately $3 billion in gross proceeds from hotel sales through the year at the halfway mark we reached approximately 40% of that $3 billion target, including the value of five hotels that we intend to contribution to our vacation ownership spin off and which we expect will also be converting to new vacation ownership inventory.
Reaching our asset light goal early does not mean we're backing off our intention to sell our remaining owned assets and reach the $3 billion goal and the spin off does not change the way we are approaching hotels -- selling hotels. Our success in selling both trophy and non-trophy hotels in 2014 demonstrates our focus to reach our goal. As we look into the rest of 2015 the asset sale market continues to look strong and demand for our hotels remains high with a record number of hotels on the market our expectation is to close transactions in 2015 that will generate gross proceeds in line with our 2014 level.
It is hard give an exact dollar amount at this point because of the timing of real estate transactions is hard to predict however our real estate team is actively pursuing transactions that make sense for Starwood and our shareholders. This leads me to the topic of return of cash and you should expect from Starwood in 2015. Investing in our business on projects that exceed our cost of capital remains our first priority. In the absence of a strategic asset to buy we expect to return approximately $550 million to $600 million in cash to stockholders in the form of regular dividends which we announced will be a 7% increase over the regular reporting dividend of last year and share repurchases. This amount assumes we complete our spin off of vacation ownership and is after our anticipated investment in existing business for growth as outlined in our guidance.
At this level return we would expect to remain at the high end of our guidance leverage range for the year which is 2.5 to 3 times gross adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. If we do find an attractive acquisition target we would reduce our repurchases to stay within or near our target level range. The $550 million to $600 million takes into account additional borrowing capacity from the growth of our hotel business EBITDA and gross proceeds from asset sales in line with 2014 results offset by decline in debt capacity related primarily to the lower EBITDA due to the spin off transaction. To the extent asset sales coming higher than last year we will look to increase the amount of repurchase to be complete in 2015.
Cash located outside of the U.S. which could be subject to tax should we repatriate it, is not included in our anticipated return of capital in 2015. Our approach to dividends remains consistent with what we previously communicated with a target payout ratio in the 30% to 50% range and a best in class yield. Our approach to repurchases in 2015 will be a combination of mostly programmatic buying with an ability to buy more of the stock price declines. While the volumes in any given quarter may fluctuate we will be focused on being price sensitive where we can but we will also adjust our approach as year goes on to meet the full year expectations we're laying out today.
Before moving to Q&A I'll turn over to Matt Avril the future CEO of the new timeshare company here with us today to talk to you a bit more about the business from his perspective. For those of you don't know Matt he began his career with Starwood in 1989 through Vistana and served both as Chief Financial Officer and subsequently Co-President and Managing Director of Operations during his tenure. He became President of Starwood's hotel group in 2008 with oversight responsibilities for the company's global hotel operations for all nine of Starwood brands and as global sales organization. Throughout his tenure Matt contributed greatly to Starwood success as a global enterprise driving key initiatives and best practices across all geographies given Matt's extensive experience with Starwood overall and 25 years of experience with SVO and the timeshare industry it was a natural fit. Matt?
Matt Avril
Thank you, Tom. I am Grateful to be here today to talk to you about the new company I have the opportunity to join as CEO following completion of the spin off and for the chance to be partnering with Steve Williams and the talented SVO team on what will be an exciting next chapter for our guests, associates and investors.
As a reminder SVO was founded in 1980 as Vistana went public in 1997 and was acquired by Starwood in 1999 through this more than 30 year history SVO's build maintained a terrific reputation with its guests and for its operating performance. At our core we intend to remain true to our company mission of being the premier provider of outstanding vacation experiences. SVO's commitment for a value based culture and to providing memorable guest experiences remain cornerstones of what we do.
Over the last 15 years SVO was able to bring its expertise in the timeshare market together with the world class brands of Starwood delivering outstanding financial results in a variety of environments. Through this transaction, we expect that the new company will be the leading developer and operator of high-quality, branded, upper upscale timeshare resorts in the most desirable destinations. We expect to continue to operate and develop new resorts under the Sheraton and Westin brands as we pursue our business plan. Guests and timeshare owners will continue to enjoy extraordinary experiences at SVO's resorts along with access to Starwood's worldwide portfolio of properties and award winning SPG programs.
We also expect that new investors will be able to benefit from our significant growth opportunities as we built on a long track record of success. Our business strategy will be backed by an attractive combination of premier brand, SPG loyalty program, high-quality product, strong business economics, talented associates and our experienced leadership group. We are currently in the process of developing our new name and logo which we believe will continue to deliver on the brand that we've established in the marketplace while emphasizing our identity and culture.
As you would expect, we are hard at work on our growth plan given the opportunities that will exist post spin, particularly with the newly contributed assets. It is worth noting that SVO operated at two-times the current level of originated sales in the 2006-2007 timeframe. We believe we have the infrastructure and resort destinations to return the company to that level of performance. We anticipate holding investor and analyst meetings related to the spinoff in the third and fourth quarter of 2015 with a plan to complete the spinoff by year-end. 
Additionally, many logistical details will be determined over the course of the next few months as we prepare for the spinoff and finalize the related documents. Importantly the new company's headquarters will be located in Orlando, Florida this will allow us to maintain our current business locations in order to continue to offer uninterrupted services to our customers and take advantage of our talented in-place leadership team. We have a phenomenal group in Orlando and across all of our locations and we expect expanding opportunities with these associates as they drive our success day-in and day-out. This is a unique high growth opportunity in the hospitality industry and we hope you will share our enthusiasm about the exciting new prospects for the vacation ownership business as a standalone company.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Stephen.
Stephen Pettibone
Thank you. We would now like to open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourself to one question at a time and then we'll take any follow-up questions you might have as time permits. Sylvia, can we have the first question please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.
Harry Curtis
Quick question on the balance of the hotels that you may sell since most of them are international given the strength of the dollar, in 2015 does it change your appetite at all to sell these hotels and can you talk a little bit about repatriation of the capital? Thanks.
Frits van Paasschen
Harry this is Frits, I'll start with an answer and then Tom may want to add some more color commentary as well. The net answer to your question is independent of fluctuations and the value of the dollar, we're committed to our asset-light program and to selling about $800 million worth of hotels in 2015 that of course is subject to individual negotiations and some of these transactions can take a little bit more or less time as we've been through that. 
The reality is I think too that the stronger dollar happens in the context of a number of other things that are happening in the global marketplace, so by itself a stronger dollar means some quantitative easing in some other markets which is lowering interest rates and potentially raising cap rates in those markets. Depending on the individual hotels a stronger dollar for example may mean actually more tourism and better performance in some of our Italian owned assets, so in the whole I think it's tough to comment on whether it will even affect the economics of sales to any significant degree. You heard Tom mention in his prepared remarks that we intend to continue our streak of being able to return capital from those sales with pretty efficient tax leakage so that would be something we'll look to continue to try to do.
With that, I'm going to hand to Tom and see if you want to add anything to that.
Tom Mangas
I think you covered it. Our expectations is we're going to continue to drive an efficient repatriation of asset sale proceeds. About 13 of the hotels we still own are in North America, 8 in Latin America, 12 are in Europe, so I think we'll have strong opportunity to return the foreign sales back to U.S. through the next couple of years.
Frits van Paasschen
Next question please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.
Felicia Hendrix
Kind of a combo for Tom and Frits here. With 2014 behind us, you guys definitely made a lot of positive strides which you talked about, you increased capital return to shareholders, we have seen a pickup of asset sales, despite FX your results in the fourth quarter were better. You sold your timeshare business, yet when we look at your peers you do lag them in unit growth and RevPAR growth and much of that is due to the chain scales in which you operate. Tom you've touched on this before but again now that you've several quarters under your belts are there any thoughts or plans to either expand into or access higher growth segments? And Frits you talked about the new collection brands so I don't know if that's part of it, but you have hotels and also with that do you have hotels in the pipeline for conversion to that brand?
Frits van Paasschen
Yes. This is Frits, I'll start to address your questions first Felicia and then as you directed some of this to Tom, I'll give him a chance as well. First of all in terms of RevPAR growth the mix of our properties both by geography and brands explains almost entirely whatever that difference might be, in fact it's one of the reasons I was careful to point out that on a RevPAR index basis we once again this year actually gained share for our individual hotels. And as we look across markets and brands we see that we're are holding up well in like geographies against like brands which is consistent with that.
In terms of unit growth as I pointed out again in my prepared remarks there were a few factors in the year that affected that and we are working hard to ensure that while we've had a comparative advantage in markets outside of the U.S. we're not going to wait for those markets to bounce back relative to the U.S. We have we believe aggressive and realistic plans to make sure that we can generate more unit growth in the U.S. and in North America at the same time.
And then finally with respect to the Collection brand, this is something that we began in discussions with owners in the latter half of 2014. We don't have any specific announcements today, but there are a number of properties that were well along in terms of our conversations. I will although however add the qualification as I do with asset sales, negotiations are sometimes hard to predict in terms of their actual point of conclusion, and so until we have something more specific to say I am not going to comment on those.
So, and I know you had a comment for Tom on his impressions I believe overall as well as other segments particularly in the budget area. And I'll hand off to Tom to deal with those, although I will say that largely speaking we see the midmarket in below is a different business model from the one we are in, but Tom you may want some more to that as well.
Tom Mangas
I would say that our acquisition focus is not targeted at the low-end at this point. We feel like our efforts at this Select Serve are gaining significant traction. We have about 40% of our overall pipeline between Aloft and Four Points by Sheraton, we're excited about the growth we're seeing there and at Alice in Los Angeles couple of weeks ago, I mean there is tremendous momentum and excitement behind the Aloft brand and the kind of returns developers can see in that business here domestically.
So I think we are going to stick with our netting on the brand we have developed. Obviously we're looking for acquisition but probably in the spaces that we're currently competing in today throughout we think we bring scale and differentiated capability.
Operator
Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.
Steven Kent
Couple of questions on the timeshare spin. We have EBIT for timeshare essentially; I don't think we have EBITDA. I am just wondering if you're going to give that depreciation number sooner rather than later and maybe in front Form-10. The reason I asked that is because we are all trying to do some other parts and analysis on that. The second thing is on timeshare just to stay within that is should we be adding the five hotels earnings into this new entity, so we're going to have to put that in and the historic timeshare EBIT is not what the forward will be.
And then one final thing for Matt from your days at Vistana and also involve with timeshare you said that timeshare sales were very strong in 2006, 2007 almost 2x. What were you doing back then that you are not doing now and does it really come down to that you may need more inventory in order to achieve those kinds of momentum, that kind of sales momentum?
Tom Mangas
So let me start off with, so we are contributing five hotels, they are operating as hotels today they will be operating as hotels most likely when this entity spins, and over time the business team will be developing its transition plans for those to move from hotels to be timeshare inventory. And it won't be all or nothing, it will phase and over time this will take pieces of the assets and move them to timeshare and as they still convert wings of the property. So yes, they should be taking that EBITDA and modeling into the new business. Then on your point on EBITDA versus EBIT and giving you the pieces, Steven do you want to help on that?
Stephen Pettibone
So the P&L numbers that we have there Steve the vacation ownership the expenses exclude depreciation and amortization, our D&A is all in consolidated D&A line. So effectively you do have the number you're looking for. I would like to turn that to Matt.
Matt Avril
I think there are sort of two or three things that you would look at. Clearly coming out of '07 and into the '08 and '09 environment there was a conscious decision to scale back the level of activity of the business generally. When you look at what was going on in the securitizations market which was the backend part of this story in all situations. And so there was a conscious desire to scale back that shows up in scaling back guest flow and everything that goes with that. And those were conscious choices at that time and those were subsequently maintained in place relative to the inventory decisions that the company has made over the last five years or six years.
But when you go back and look at the operating level at that time, it's really in the core markets that we are today, Hawaii, Orlando and Mexico we have the physical facilities in place to scale back up our guest flow over time and sort of an orderly way, and that we've got access to securitization markets that will allow us to continue to do that in a capital efficient way. So I think those are couple of the highlights.
Operator
Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley
Just two questions. The first one would be, I was just wondering if you guys could outline a little bit better, how you kind of strategically decided between choosing the path of the spin-offs for the timeshare business, and possibly evaluating sale alternatives for that business? And my follow up question would be and this is possibly just a clarification but the very end of the prepared remarks, as it relates to cash returns. Tom, I think you said that the $550 million to $600 million did that include $800 million or something similar to 2014 in proceeds? Because still I'm having trouble getting the cash breaks to work on that. That would be helpful.
Frits van Paasschen
Yes, Shaun, this is Frits I'll talk to this spin versus sale piece first and then I know Tom will clarify the cash question you had as well. We believe first of all that SVO is a standalone company with access to a shareholder base is a great model for that business, and our ability to partner with the team that is in place is something we're very excited about. And just as when we sell hotels our goal is to make sure that we have across the table an entity and a group of people and a team not to mention a working relationship and structure that positions us for the long-term to create value.
So for us right now that would be in the form of a spin, as we also said though in the course of our remarks there is quite a bit of work to do between now and the spin and as you would imagine in the interest of our shareholder but also in the interest of the future business, we'll entertain discussions as we said.
So with that, Shaun I'm going to hand to Tom to talk about the cash return for 2015.
Tom Mangas
I'm glad you asked Shaun, because I want just to be really clear and so let me just walk you through. So, we described in my script cash from operations than expectation of $700 million to $800 million that includes the capital going into SVO because in the way we treat our balance sheet and our cash flows we do put the CapEx associated with SVO specifically in the cash from operations. If you exclude it would start with more like an $860 million to $960 million number. So, 700 to 800, we're spending 400 million in the balance of the business on growth activities and net rooms development pipeline that we described an IT innovation.
Now the key piece that you may be missing is, because of the spin we're losing leverage capacity, we're taking those hotel EBITDA that we're putting in the five hotels of EBITDA plus the SVO EBITDA out of the core company. And that's driving about $400 million reduction in our leverage capacity by year-end. And then we'll pay the regular dividends which ballpark to $250 million, the share repurchase that we guided about 300 to 350. And then yes, you need in the asset sales roughly at last year's levels coming back at the same sort of gross-to-net yield to get you back to that bridge equalizing.
Operator
Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli
Most of my questions have been answered. But Thomas, you won't mind providing a little bit of color around that the growth strategy and clearly you guys have discussed making, just spending a little bit more on that business or at least redirecting efforts in that business. But could you talk about how -- maybe strategy with respect to unit growth has evolved here over the last few months and quarters?
Tom Mangas
Sure, and I'll let Frits come in after you give me the opportunity. I'd say that, look we were disappointed with our net rooms growth in 2014 and we're taking several actions to drive to our longer term target of 4% to 5% net rooms growth. I'd say the first thing we're doing is we're putting an incremental feet on the street and resource across functions including finance, my function and legal to support higher levels of deal activity and frankly more complicated deal activity. I think we have -- low end of the market as we've been wanting to go out there and do pretty straight forward key money deals, and I think the development community is looking for us to bring additional tools to help them get deals off the ground in forms of debt guarantees or operating guarantees and different forms of balance sheet participation that we generally have not done before, but we're tackling now, and the resource support it.
The second thing I would say that we're doing is we've been a company that's been built on acquisitions, and we really haven't done an acquisition since the Le MÃ©ridien deal back in 2005, 2006 other than the design hotels acquisition couple of years ago. And I think you'll see us being a bit more intentional here adding that as a lever to drive net rooms growth, so inorganic lever to drive that.
The third thing is I think we've been more open in our business model and things like the Collection brand that Frits announced today is a way we're evolving our business model to meet some of the key opportunities that we've not been able to access with our nine core brands.
So I think we've taken several actions to be more aggressive on the growth front, things that are in our control adapting some of our business model. And I'm very confident that with this mix of actions that you'll see us make significant progress here. Frits, you want to add anything?
Frits van Paasschen
Yes, Carlo, I'm going to jump into and mostly reemphasize and attempt to clarify some of the things that both Tom and I said in our prepared remarks. Our system largely in terms of developing hotel footprint over the last few years has been built to directly where we'd seen our strength and where the growth has been, and that's largely been in upper upscale and Luxury in markets outside of the U.S. And as the market has shifted very significantly from a development standpoint in terms of new hotels to North America and Select Serve we need to redirect and have already our efforts towards that segment.
The good news as I summarized in my prepared remarks is that the three brands that we have there are in great shape, they complement each other and they have strong momentum. And as Tom spoke to it and as I witnessed myself in conversations that we had with North American owners and analysts there is a renewed enthusiasm and interest in particularly the Aloft brand. But I would say for both Element and Four Points by Sheraton as well. That all having been said, we're certainly not by any stretch giving up on our growth markets and again when I emphasize that beyond even my prepared remarks earlier, we continue to see the fundamentals driving underlying growth in markets around the world which is why even if North America at this exact moment is the flavor of the month from a lodging perspective when you look over time and the potential in a market like India that's an enormous opportunity for us and one that we think given the new Modi administration is really exciting.
I would just also point out that in China this year we will reach a point where we have 300 hotels between those open and those in the pipeline and while some of the timeframes on those pipeline properties may take longer to deliver China is one of the highest yield markets in terms of when a hotel gets signed that they are eventually and ultimately open.
Tom alluded to some of the support across the process, I mentioned some of the streamlining and work that we're doing to make sure that when we have a deal and opportunity we can respond crisply and quickly but we can also if necessary on a temporary basis tie up a hotel which then leads me to the Collection based strategy. And I would just say this we have almost 90 Luxury Collection hotels, we have 20 years of experience with the Collection brand there. We were very excited to bring design hotels into our systems and it's only thanks to the fact that these are process for acquiring a company in Germany is as arcane and time consuming as it is that it's taken a while to bring that into our system. As we got closer to the design hotels team it became very clear to us that among those nearly 300 hotels they have a strong Collection brand with a distinct positioning.
And so we made the strategic decision at that point to say that there was right space between Luxury Collection and design hotels. And with the system support that we've invested in the last few years, we believe our systems can drive real incremental value to properties but we also of course believe that in the right markets our brands will continue to drive value above that but it gives us another tool in our arsenal to try to grow. We haven't talked much about exits, but we've been through a process in the last several years both with Le MÃ©ridien and Sheraton to clean up those brands and we think that will begin to tail down and our exits will be lower accordingly.
And then finally on M&A, we continue to be active looking at the market. We think it's as important to do a good deal as it is to avoid doing a deal that may give us a great headline in terms of unit growth, but ends up with a grand bag of hotels that take a long time to manage through. And so we'll maintain both our financial as well as our system discipline there, but rest assured especially with the continued generation of cash of our business we're going to look at M&A as well.

Your next question comes from Nikhil Bhalla from FBR.
Nikhil Bhalla
Quick questions. One, after your timeshare spin-off and I think you've said previously that by the end of 2016 you want 80% of your business to be international. And so the question here is after the timeshare spin-off how much of your business would be international at that point in time?
Tom Mangas
This is Tom; I don't think we've ever made a statement that we want 80% of our business to beâ¦
Frits van Paasschen
Yes, I think that 2016 timeframe was for fee based versus owned. We have said that we believe given the trajectory of our pipeline that we would trend towards an 80% international fee base as well, we haven't put a timeframe on that but if you just look at the continued acceleration of growth around the world that's something that we see likely happening, I don't think it would surprise anybody to wake up in many years' time and find that our China business is at least as big as North America just by virtue of its absolute size. But especially given the exchange rate environment is one example, that's not a target that we would put a specific timeframe again.
Operator
Your next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.
Joe Greff
With regard to the four hotels that are going to the spin-off timeshare company, you described them as being contributed or placed with the timeshare company. Are you receiving any cash proceeds or what consideration are you receiving or are you thinking about that? And then back to an earlier question with evaluating spin or sell. Did you actually actively try to sell the business in any kind of soft way? And then I've a follow up balance sheet question for Tom?
Frits van Paasschen
Joe this is Frits, I'm going to begin addressing some of your questions hand off to Matt and then we'll give you a chance to ask Tom here your second set of question. So first of all, it's actually five hotels that we're putting into the spin-off; that's three in Mexico; one in Steamboat in Colorado and one in Hawaii. And we carefully selected those as places where we have a proven track record of selling properties we see demand and good economics for being able to give SVO a great pipeline of new inventory. And our point of view is that we would put that into the new entity that the EBITDA would be transferred along with it that we would as part of the fee structure that we will lay out in the Form-10 be compensated as Starwood for those brands, but create a system by which it's easy enough for the new company to make the right decision to grow its own business. So I hope clarifies your questions around the brand. Tom you want to add something to that?
Tom Mangas
Yes some of other considerations. So the short answer is we haven't work through -- this is fundamentally what the balance sheet of the new company is going to look like and do we take cash from the new company before the spin. So we're not prepared to comment on that at this point right now, we're just expecting to contribute to hotels and we'll kind of reveal where we think the starting balance sheet position is for the new company which will reflect any form of distribution that might come back to the parent prior to spin.
Frits van Paasschen
And then Joe I think you asked whether we had looked quietly to sell this or not. Our point of view is and I have alluded to this earlier in an answer to a question. We see the tremendous value and we think sufficient scale for this business to be on its own. I don't think it would surprise any of us if there would be some people who might express an interest in the business as some other owners have structure. And as I said earlier as well we'll look at that but we'll make the consideration base here on as we do sell our hotels the economics, the partner of the growth prospect, the ability to protect our brands and all the things that is either a hard shareholder or a timeshare shareholder you would want us to make. I'm going to hand to Matt, because I think if he wants -- going to ask you Matt is there anything you want to comment on those five properties and how you view those markets for timeshare looking ahead.
Matt Avril
When you look at specifically as Frits alluded to in Mexico where we have the Westin Lagunamar property in the Cancun market that has been a terrific success for the company. This gives us additional opportunity in that marketplace and it also gives us two beachheads on the West Coast of Mexico in Cabo and Puerto Vallarta that we think will be well positioned to continue in that marketplace. In Hawaii with the success we've had on Maui, the Sheraton property in Kauai gives us there's another opportunity to provide a new experience for our guests but also add distribution capability, which I think is one of the important things in considering when you think about these hotels yes the EBITDA from the hotels will move over but so will all of the guest flow opportunities that come from people staying in those hotels to be what are the opportunity to own timeshare. And so we think we're going to have expanded distribution as we go forward and obviously that all cycles back eventually in terms of the fee opportunity to start with on an ongoing basis from originated sales.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker from MLV.
Ryan Meliker
I just wanted to talk a little about asset sales; I think everybody is answering all the questions on timeshare and the spin-off. But you guys obviously -- asset sales accelerated in the fourth quarter we've seen some big numbers come in New York with regards to Chinese insurance companies opening up their wallets for U.S. investments. I'm just wondering, do you expect asset sales to continue to accelerate throughout 2015? Are you seeing with the changes in the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, I guess red-tape and processes allowing more Chinese investors to invest outside of the country. Are you seeing more traction for your European assets or rather Asian assets, just any color on what we might be able to expect going forward and how things are trending would be helpful?
Frits van Paasschen
Yes Ryan so we've been careful to say that we'll continue with the pace to get to the 3 billion by the end of '16 recognizing as you saw on the fourth quarter relative to the few that proceeded it, asset sales are lumpy things especially when you look at some of the bigger transactions that we're talking about. Among the lines though and the nature of your question, we have seen more capital from different areas in the asset buying activity including U.S. REITs but also some Chinese financial institutions you would have noticed for example that the buyer of the Sheraton On The Park in Sydney was a Chinese insurance company.
So we'll continue to look at selling each of our properties where we can. I mean while we pace our sales it certainly has been probably more of a good thing than a bad thing that we've been doing this carefully, because I think '15 is a year where we'll see more interest in higher value and some recent transactions that certainly point in that direction. That said we don't want to wait until it's too late either, so this is a matter of continuing on an asset-by-asset basis with the target set of owners to identify and set up the best prices for that. With that I am going to hand to Tom 
Tom Mangas
And I think to your core question there Ryan, I do think that many of the Chinese insurance companies, individuals are looking for diversification, they are looking for a place to be able to put money for 50 years, 100 years, that they know is going to be there, with an appropriate return also with our Middle East buyers. So I think the buyer community is going to continue to be strong and support the guidance we provided on that.
Operator
Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen
Two questions. First of on just on leverage to your answer to an earlier question. You highlight that the spin would create about $400 million of headwinds on your leverage capabilities, but once the spin is consummated shouldn't that be an opportunity to put on some incremental leverage given you will no longer have the non-recourse timeshare debt on the parent level. And then the second just -- of your assumption RevPAR guidance for 2015. Can you just help us think about North America versus international RevPAR outlook? And how you are factoring in any transactional or fundamental impact of the stronger U.S. dollar?
Tom Mangas
So this is Tom. So, you are right 400 million is the headwind that does presume we're operating in the 2.5 times to 2.3 times that EBITDA leverage range for the year. I will say that I think it's logical to assume that over time as we shut assets through our asset-light strategy and certainly the spin is a big component of that, that we're to be able to move up our leverage level, we are not guiding on that now and frankly that's something that we are going to continue to dialogue with our ratings agencies and to preserve our ratings we have today.
Certainly I think Marriot demonstrated a capability there and a couple of years after their spin to do that. I also think that their predominant business being North America's supports that kind of less risk view relative to our more geographically diverse may or may not. But that's certainly something we're dialoguing with our rating agencies and think could be a benefit upside down the road. Certainly not something we are going to be exercising in the current year.
Relative to RevPAR, we are seeing positive signs out there on RevPAR both in North America, our own expectation, we have added in our franchise hotels but relative to our own expectation that we would have laid out in October were up almost a 100 basis points on our RevPAR expectations for the year, inclusive of that the franchise piece. But we're also seeing a little bit better Europe, we're seeing little bit better Africa and Middle East and rest of Asia, all are stronger than what we thought going into the third quarter and probably into the fourth quarter that as we gave our initial guidance of 4% to 6% and it's what's encouraging us to take our guidance range up for the year.
And we did indicate, that is on a local currency basis and FX is impacting our ranges by about 300 basis points and knocking those down. So it is a significant headwind across the markets.
Frits van Paasschen
Yes this is Frits; I would just add couple of other points to emphasize even more what Tom has said. First of all of course the local currency number in the 300 basis points reflects today's exchange rates and you as well as anybody can model in but you expect otherwise if not today. And then just in terms of our increasing the outlook for 2015 since we last talked some of that's related to continue momentum in RevPAR index and some of the systems investments that we have made to improve the individual performance of our hotels. I would say as a generalization and again this is very much consistent with what you just heard from Tom an incremental, modest improvement generally in trend lines around the world with some puts and takes but slightly better outlook than before. And then a part of this is driven although I wouldn't overstate this by having our franchise properties and therefore the whole system put together.
So those I think are some of the building blocks to the outlook that we have it right now.

Your next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James and Associates.
Bill Crow
Tom first for you, I know going back to Joe's question about compensation for the five assets contributed. Could you at least talk about how you are thinking about the value of those assets? And the second part of that question is how do you come up to the $30 million to $40 million base fees that the SVO would pay to Starwood? And then Frits for you, I've covered Starwood for 15 years and you have always been known as owners [brave] company and the great relationship with the owners. Are we starting to hear about growing frustration of communications between the owners and Starwood, some frustration with the Westin brand in particular we have seen some REITs pull the flag off property. Is that impeding unit growth and how do you -- maybe this is normal reaction but I just want to get your sense for how the relationship is with the owners.
Tom Mangas
So let me start, this is Tom. So as we outlined we think we have got about $20 million of net EBITDA boost with the hotels to the SVO. And so putting -- there are interesting properties and that they already have some of sort of kind of connectivity with other vacation ownership structures around them in many places. As we did our evaluation on what's the highest and best use for them. We concluded the SVO is the highest and best use versus a straight sale that has a little complex with it. So I think we're valuing these hotels probably in the $200 million to $250 million asset sale value, that's how we get to the 40% of our $3 billion target inclusive of the sales we previously done. So, that's how we're thinking about their value and the transfer that comes with that.
I will say on the 30 million to 40 million of base fees, we're expecting that the business relationship with the spin company will be at arm's length. So we're engineering license fee stream that we think will stand the test of an arm's length test, we've been booking certainly at our competition, we've done this in other companies who have similar forms of relationship and feel like this base fee with a growth component in it is pretty standard, it's one that we think would stand at test of time and also deliver a fair going incentive for the vacation ownership business to grow the business and not be burdened by an onerous fee on growth but also ensure a steady fee in return for our terrific brand the business will receive. Got to give it to Frits.
Frits van Paasschen
Yes, Bill thanks for the question because I think there are few things here that I can address that may clarify the situation. The first is, while we don't publish the numbers we do on a regular basis track our owner feedback on a quantitative level. And we continue to see that trend go in the right direction in aggregate in North America. And for the reason you alluded to at the beginning of that part of your question, we do see ourselves in the business of creating great returns for owners, having relationships to those owners lies at the heart of our business model and something we take really seriously.
The second point, with respect to Westin, it's quite interesting. We've seen RevPAR index for Westin continue to rise. It's performing well in North America in fact its RevPAR index today is as high or close to as high as it's been in the history of the brand. In terms of pipeline worldwide it's almost as strong as -- well it's actually in terms of a rooms basis in the top half among our brands overall and has a stronger pipeline as we've seen.
You heard my mention that we opened our 200th Westin around the world just recently. And so again if you look at the overall upper-upscale business model in North America, which broadly speaking has been under pressure for the last six or seven years, we actually have two brands between Westin and Le MÃ©ridien that continue to buck that trend and have growth. In terms of the flag, I think what you're referring to are one or two isolated instances not something that we see by any means is being systemic for the Westin brand.
So, overall we feel good about where Westin is in terms of its positioning focusing on wellness and the economic model that lies behind it.

Your next question comes from David Loeb from Robert W. Baird.
David Loeb
I kind of have one and a half on asset sales. Frits, just briefly you talked about the benefits of waiting and the asset sales in terms of pricing, but isn't there also a trade-off and buying back stock at much higher prices and if you'd used fewer proceeds a few years ago to buy more stock. And then as a follow up to both Harry and Ryan's question, you'd listed that brokers well more than $800 million in assets, let's just say over the last year. Have you pulled some of the larger or higher value assets that have been listed with brokers from the market or do you just plan to be more selective or opportunistic with the sale of those assets?
Frits van Paasschen
Yes, so David, first of all, you're absolutely right, there is always of trade-off between where the stock is in asset sales and if it's a pure trade-off between selling assets and stock price, that point would be correct. The picture is a little bit more complicated than that because it depends on how we'll be allocating capital in the future although clearly, share repurchase as you heard from Tom today remains an important priority for us. I think the point there was that, we've certainly seen an incremental increase in the value of assets around the world and so that trade-off is something that we've felt too badly about.
And we don't keep a list of hotels that are on the market today and there is no way that ought to be tracked in the marketplace. I can tell you that we're in active discussion with our properties with different owners around the world, some of those are more widely known, some of those are more discrete which is why as a general case we try to be clear about what we think the volume will be for a year, which in this case we said is about par with last year's $800 million, the actual number will depend on some of those individual conversations.
But I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is, last year we did explore as I think many people talked about a multiple property sale and we determined in discussions around that we were much better off doing these transactions on a one-off basis because of the types of owners that were interested in different assets.

Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin Farley
Two clarifications. One is, on your RevPAR guidance, I know you said you have better franchise expectations than you did last quarter. I wonder if you could comment just on -- I think company operated with how you gave guidance, a quarter ago you talked about company operated being up 4% to 6%. So wondering if you could kind of give us some insight to what your RevPAR expectations are for that same set?
And then also just looking at the 3 billion asset sales that you had targeted by 2016. Am I doing the math right that that leaves kind of over 1 billion in asset sales for next year in order to meet that goal assuming that you do 800 million this year. So just wanted to confirm that.
Tom Mangas
All right, so Robin this is Tom. The difference between system wide and owned and managed is only about 30 basis points total on a worldwide basis. So it's not a big driver of our increase, so we're getting a much bigger lift from performance in the markets as I outlined. And I think we're seeing stronger performance in certainly North America than we thought at the beginning of the quarter Europe as I indicated, the Africa Middle East is up meaningfully versus what we thought couple months ago, and again rest of Asia is performing strongly, China is flat. We expect China to have a good RevPAR in the middle of the zone that we've outlined the total for the worldwide performance but it's unchanged versus our guidance.

Your next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.
Rich Hightower
Most of them have been answered. But a quick question on timeshare going forward. So, it seems like you guys are still committed to keeping that a capital intensive business in terms of development on the balance sheet and so forth rather than using external capital when I think that many of your competitors in that business have sort of gravitated towards a capital like model. And just wondering what the thinking is behind that and where you see the business going forward?
Frits van Paasschen
Rick this is Frits, I'll make a couple of comments and then I am sure Matt will want to add some as well. From the standpoint of Starwood assuming the planned spin goes forward as we've outlined from a Starwood perspective that would put us in an asset like model with respect to the timeshare business which is consistent with what we've been doing with our hotel assets as well. In terms of how the new company intends to finance and manage growth, that's the structure and a series of decisions that that management team will be making as they seize it. And on that I am going to give Matt an opportunity to add any color if he'd like to at this point.
Matt Avril
I'll pick a couple of comments, one I think in certain key markets having a certain amount of exposure to that inventory that we have reasonable pace of sales expectations, I think will serve us and our customers well. Having said that how we ultimately secure the capital to do expansions in some of these markets or convert some of the properties, we'll make those decisions as we go forward based on the choices that are available to us.
As you're alluding to I think you see inventory levels out amongst the competitive set today from anywhere to somewhere between one and two years to as much as six years in sort of on balance sheet inventory, and I think we'll look at all of those things taking into consideration the pace of sales, the consumer take for, the products in those markets and the sources of capital and structures that would make the most sense.
The company has today and will continue to have sort of inventory recovery programs, I think in the manner that you're alluding to on some of the competitive sets and that's been part of the recurring operation today and will be so going forward. So we'll look to blend all those things for a cost of product and a capital management dynamic.

Your final question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research.
Vince Ciepiel
Could you comment on the trajectory of North America versus international fee growth, I think you mentioned 5 to 7 kind of on a core basis, and when you adjust for FX to kind of get into those numbers. What do you think about core growth North America versus international for 2015?
Tom Mangas
So this is Tom. I would say that we are enjoying good fee growth in North America but it's stronger internationally right now and our base fees and also our incentive fees largely because we have incentive fees from day one in our international contracts and generally in North America we have to hit certain thresholds we haven't quite hit them in North America yet given we're a relatively new company with newer contracts. So I would say relative to total fees it is faster growing total fee growth also reflecting our footprint growth in the international markets relative North America.
Frits van Paasschen
And just to emphasize what Tom said we are not yet seeing as the acceleration in North America of our fee base based on incentive fees kicking in. We're still a few years away from that and in a number of our contracts, and so that's something that's held back our near-term outlook for fee growth in North America of course every time we do expect to be able to get there and the longer this cycle continues it narrows I guess.
