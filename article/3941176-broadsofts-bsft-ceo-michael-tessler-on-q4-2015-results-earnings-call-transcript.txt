Michael Tessler
Thanks, Chris. Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the time to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. I am speaking with you having just returned from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where we met a large number of our customers and prospects. There were sections where our mobile-first UC vision was enthusiastic. A little later I will go into more details about the show. I wanted to start off by recapping the past year. I am proud that we delivered a strong 2015. As usual, Jim will provide the financial details later. I wanted to highlight some of our key accomplishments from the year. We surpassed 13 million host of UC lines, with an order of magnitude larger than any of our competitors. We created our go forward product vision around project Tempo, to address the rapidly changing face of business communication.
We won a number of large complex metal transformation deals and remained on track implementing those and other previously won transformation projects. We established BroadSoft design to create customized, superior user experiences that further differentiate our UC solutions. We launched BroadCloud into Japan, an attractive market for adoption of hosted UC solutions. It's early but expected to accelerate. BroadCloud is now available in four countries; United States, U.K., Germany and Japan. These accomplishments would not have been possible except for the unwavering dedication of the entire BroadSoft team. I want to thank all of them for their efforts and I also want to thank our customers and partners for their continued support.
Now, on to 2016. We are looking forward to having another strong year. We have a leadership position and a great market opportunity. What most of you see, is a secular growth trend, just the beginning of an adoption curve.
In order to maintain and extend that leadership, we are focused on four strategic priorities. The first is to continue to be an innovation leader. The second is to expand our BroadCloud footprint. The third is to improve the yield of our existing market or channel. And finally the last objective is to grow our business by adding new market channels and also increasing the breadth of our solutions available through that. My goal is to update you each quarter on our progress against each of these strategic priorities.
Let's talk about our Q1 activities in that context. First, our continued innovation. Our global market leadership and growth will continue to be derived from our commitment to innovation. The Unified Communications market landscape is changing along with demographics of people in the workplace and the flexibility they have in how, when and where they work. To address this we created Project Tempo, our vision for the future of work. Its goal is to significantly improve team productivity through better collaboration and eliminating the time wasted in group communication searching for relevant shared documents, email and attached files. We are close to launching the beta program for our UC-One Hub solutions. As you may recall UC-One Hub is our first product deliverable as part of Tempo and the level of interest in our customers around the globe has been incredible.
The pipeline for our beta program continues to grow and we are in the process of formalizing agreements with a handful of service providers and expect to be in market trialing the product within a couple of months. Second, on the BroadCloud footprint expansion, as we have said before there are significant advantages for service providers to move to BroadCloud. It accelerates their market with minimal upfront investment. It allows companies to be more responsive to their market needs and gives them a real competitive advantage. For us, it's an attractive business model with a recurring revenue stream.
In 2015, we expanded BroadCloud in Japan and in 2016 we plan on selectively adding additional geographies in response to customer demand. Our expansion goals are not just limited to new countries though. We are moving to address civic verticals as well. Hospitality was our first vertical expansion and we are currently in process of getting our BroadCloud offering in the U.S. FedRAMP certified. FedRAMP is the mandated overarching security and process control benchmark for cloud service providers serving federal civilian agencies. We see the federal government as a large opportunity with over 2 million total seats and a large percentage of them on legacy PDM Centric services. The timing is right for us to address this market space and we expect to become FedRAMP certified later this year with revenue contribution in 2017.
Third, on our self-strategic priority, we're starting a new initiative to extend the BroadCloud brand to the end user. To date, we have always been a white label solution but the market dynamics are changing. Larger enterprises in particular, once they carefully evaluate their solutions vendors, as they look to migrate from their ongoing solutions. Our approach will be to work in concert with our third party partners in co-branding exercises. We got a good reception from a number of customers to this idea which is a testament to the trust and faith they have in us to tie their brand equity to ours. We believe that over time this co-branding approach will be an important tool to driving hosted UC options in large enterprises. We expect to see some good points of initiatives coming from customers this year.
Lastly, on our strategy in growing our markets. A great example of the acquisition of Transera which we announced earlier this month. As background, Transera addresses the hosted, contact center market. Traditionally call centers like PBX's have been on premise based solution. During the compelling advantage of the hosted solutions, the market is migrating. According to an industry report, the market for hosted contact center is estimated to be $15 billion by 2020 and we believe the current penetration levels vs legacy premise based solutions are about the same as that of the hosted UC market at low to mid-single digits.
Our two markets are extremely complimentary. In fact an integrated contact center offering is the number one offering that our third party customers were asking for as it creates soft selling opportunities. Hosted contact center deals can drag along hosted UC deals and vice versa. Second, it is important to winning large enterprises opportunities as contact center capabilities are becoming required. From the product perspective Transera has a full contact center solution supporting multiple channels including voice, chat and email.
Like BroadSoft, the product is highly scalable and excels from sales environments working fully integrated with salesforce.com as the largest most demanding contact center environments in the world. For example, one customer today has over 4000 agents across 30 call centers on 4 continents using the platform. This is truly an enterprise class solution. What really differentiates Transera and made them a visionary in the Gardner hosted call center space are its advanced analytics which provide insights to improve efficiency and profitability of the contact center. The solution uses data mined by the system to dynamically make recommendations in real-time on how, who to route calls. Using this approach, customers have dramatically improved their contact center KPI around sales conversion, customer satisfaction and abandoned calls.
As you know, BroadSoft currently has an existing software based call center product, will continue to sell those offering as software and we don't see much kind of relation from our new cloud based contact center offering. We are very excited to have the Transera team join us. They bring a tremendous amount of contact center DNA into BroadSoft and will form the core of our new BroadCloud contact center group which will be headed by Prem Uppaluru, the former CEO of Transera.
I wanted to close my remarks today by providing commentary about the Mobile World Congress show last week. It's an extremely busy cause for us with a fully packed schedule of meetings. We showed solution based on project Tempo aligned with a truly Mobile-First approach. Mobile-First means that it will be available anywhere and user experience has to have a same richness no matter what device is being used. This is especially critical for the millennia of generation.
I take away from customer actions with the mobile carriers now realize the importance of B2B services for them as a driver of revenue and customer stickiness. As a result Unified Communications will become an attractive business opportunity. Many search providers have already made the most of the core network centric investments in IMS and LTE required to provide these types of services to customers and this year we will see a number of our customers launching both converged fixed-mobile and mobile only offerings into the marketplace.
With that I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim
Jim Tholen
Thanks, Mike. We view our Q4 results as a great finish to a very strong 2015. Q4 represented our sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth. We also think it shows significant momentum in our business going into 2016. Total revenue was $19 million, up 36% from year-ago quarter and billings were $91 million up 8% year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.04 up 60% from a year-ago period. For the full year 2015, revenue was $279 million, up 29% with billings of $288 million were up 20%. For year 2015, non-GAAP EPS was $1.96. Professional services was a big revenue headline for Q4.
For services another revenue was up more than 300% year-over-year to $24 million. Billing for $12 million essentially flat from the year ago period. The P.S. clearly drove our revenue stream and exceeded our own expectations. I did want to give you some color on the magnitude of these numbers. We knew we were going to have a large P.S. quarter, the likelihood that we would hit certain revenue recognition milestones from some big projects. The outperformance really came from achieving revenue milestones on one additional large project that we had expected would hit in 2016. This one project contributed about $7 million to our overall number.
The good news beyond our results is that we continue to track well on these major deals and expect significant professional services and software revenue contributions from them over the next few years. I know that these projects truly are transformational in nature and there is as a resolve a very large and complex endeavors. We are both humbled and excited that we have been selected as a go for partner for so many service providers as they migrate to an all IP future.
Drilling down on our other revenue line items, software license revenue was $35 million, up 2% year-over-year while software license billing was $36 million, down a bit year-over-year. Just a note, software revenue and billings were up solidly for the year and the Q4 comparison was a tough one relative to a very strong Q4 of last year. To give a little more background on our software business, we had a strong North American performance both for the quarter and year. We saw software performance internationally. This is driven by both some overall softness and really very little year-end budget buying there. And a tough comparison from a larger APAC deal from 2014. I will say that our European and APAC books of business look strong for 2016 and several of our transformation projects for which we expect to see revenue this year in Europe.
In addition, sell-through by our carrier customers is strong in 2015 with 30% year-over-year growth both globally and in Europe. And I think we should see a nice international rebound this year. Our subscription and maintenance support revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $30 million. Maintenance support revenue of $22 million was up 24% year-over-year. SaaS Revenue of $8.7 million grew from $7.5 million in the year ago period, although we did see a slight decline sequentially. It is important to understand that this decline was not due to any change in the fundamentals underlying our BroadCloud business.
In fact, we grew our sub base to over 250,000 subscribers from 200,000 at the end of Q2. Rather with the results of now amicably resolved contract issue we had with one of our large customers. That resulted in us not taking SaaS revenue from that customer in the fourth quarter. We anticipate we will return back to growth trajectory in Q1, expect SaaS revenue of greater than $12 million in the quarter. For the full year basis we expect total SaaS revenue to grow in the range of about 60%.
Now moving on to costs and margins. For Q4, we had gross margin of 82% vs 81% in the year ago period and 24% last quarter. The big driver in the gross margin improvements was the big professional services revenue performance this quarter. We call that for professional services we expense our cost in the quarter in which they are incurred so there is a high flow-through of revenue outperform it down to the bottom line. Software and support margins were up this relative to prior period and SaaS margins declined a bit into the mid-30s due to a combination of sequential decline in the SaaS revenue and our ongoing investments into the business.
For Q1 we expect overall cost of sales to be up about a $1 million to $1.5 million due to additional expenses from our recent acquisitions as well as investments primarily in our SaaS business. Operating margin was 36% as compared to 30% in the prior year period and 17% last quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $41 million, up $7 million year-over-year with the primary driver being increased headcount across sales & marketing and R&D.
On a sequential basis OpEx was up $2 million largely due to typically end of year increases in sales expense and cost related to our connections user event. Again you can see the disproportionate impact on our overall margins of revenue outperformance. Our expectation for Q1 2016 is that OpEx will grow approximately $4 million from Q4 2015 with the biggest drivers being additional expenses from our recent acquisition as well as targeted investments and growth. On the balance sheet cash equivalents and investments total $351 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable of $108 million were up from a $102 million in Q3. DSOs declined sequentially to a 109 days. Deferred revenue increased sequentially by $1 million to $111 million with normal Q4 strength in maintenance billing offset by PS revenue coming of the balance sheet.
Net cash from operations is a very strong $27 million in the quarter and $45 million in 2015. For those you who may model us on a GAAP basis, we have changed our accounting policy for recognizing stock comp expense from the graded method to the much more typical straight line method. We believe this enables comparable to be more meaningful relative to our peers. The change is both retrospective and go forth and we show its impact on our historical note in the footnote to the financial statements of our 10-K which are available today.
Now on to guidance, as you saw on our earnings press release, we expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $74 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.32. For the year we expect revenue to be in the range $332 million to $340 million inclusive of the $7 million to $8 million contributions from the acquisition of Transera. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.90 - $2.10 which includes $0.05 of dilution related to our recent acquisitions.
A couple of notes about our guidance. First on seasonality, we are pleased with the forecasted strength implicit in our Q1 revenue guide with the view to our annual guide of $332 million $340 million I expect our year to be Q4 weighted as we expect it to be another strong quarter driven by couple of large transformation deals for which we expect it to hit the milestone during that time. We expect the solid software year with additional contributions from network transformational deals. We also expect to see a rebound in our European business led by several of these transformation projects.
As I noted before, we expect our BroadCloud, SaaS revenue to grow by approximately 60%. We see continued organic growth, positive impact from our continued footprint expansion as well as the contributions from our recent acquisitions. Professional services should grow modestly in 2016 off a very strong 2015 and will be driven by transformation deals and a full year of brought up designs. From a gross margin and operating margin standpoint I think we will end 2016 at about the same level as we had previously expected for 2015 but down somewhat from our 2015 actuals given the impact of our strong Q4.
For gross margin, there are a few things to consider. I think the gross margin for subscription and support will be flat as the strong margins for maintenance business are offset by our faster growing lower margin SaaS business. For SaaS, the margin improvements in our more mature markets will be all set to some degree by some of the investment Mike talked about in geographic expansion and investments in BroadCloud for US federal government opportunity. I expect our PS margins to return to a more normal mid to high 30s range and on the operating side we will see some impact from our acquisition so I expect that OpEx will grow slightly faster than our overall revenue growth rate.
On our tax rate we now expect that our non-GAAP cash tax rate will be 5% for 2016. We believe it will remain at about that level through 2020. Finally on EPS, I'm cognizant that our EPS guidance doesn't look particularly ambitious relative to our 2015 performance. We built our plan assuming that 2015 would come in consistent with the guided rate we gave in Q3. As we saw last year, just the bit of revenue outperformance really falls to the bottom line. On relative basis that makes 2015 a tough call. On an absolute basis though the mid-point of 2016 guide suggests that's growing 20% top-line with about 20% margins while we invest, expand our competitive, differentiation and position to what we believe very attractive secular market opportunity. We think this plan is a very solid balance growth plan for the year.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler
Thanks, Jim. Jim & I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator would you please open the call.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Dmitry Netis
Thank you very much. Nice quarter gentlemen. Okay, quick couple of questions. On the visibility of that pooling of $7 million of the service revenue Jim, can you walk us through little bit more detail regarding to that project? Seems like it is a North American focus deal but give us a little bit of detail of the source of the project and was it with that customer you announced last quarter?
Jim Tholen
So -- yes couple of comments on that and Q4. It was a large transformation project for us. We didn't identify the geography but I guess looking at North America vs rest of the world for our Q4, one could surmise that. We had a fair amount of overall PS number, fair amount of revenue recognition from network transformation projects. And these deals are big, they are highly complex and revenue recognition around them could be complex and the timing from getting customer acceptance which is a revenue recognition requirement for us could be certain and often not driven by us and driven by things more broadly in the project.
And so when we look at guidance for Q4 we looked at all these projects and to be honest, clearly, we suggested that PS number would be high but not nearly this high and that was a reflection on some of the uncertainty on the project. This one in particular we viewed as possible but really quite unlikely to come in to 2015 and we thought it was much more, much, much more likely in 2016, in fact it was part of our 2016 plan. And basically at the start of the line, we were ahead on the project, our team really and the customer, I would say quite delightfully, gave us acceptance very near the end of the year.
Dmitry Netis
Great. And so this customer, I would surmise that this is the first time you get recognized revenue from this network conservation project with that customer? There were no prior arrangements or rembrax [ph] from that customer in the past? So this is kind of a first occurrence, that fair?
Jim Tholen
Yes, but just to be clear. Yes, like I said on many projects, it is far from a won and done. For this project, for this PS, this is the first time we have taken revenue from this customer. There's a lot more of PS in software to go on the project.
Dmitry Netis
Right, which leads me to the next question on the license billing side of things. It seems or I would surmise that the professional services optic this quarter would be a leading indicator into the license growth or license billings growth going forward. It did come a little bit light this quarter, the license billings number. I see that didn't stop you from offering a very strong full year revenue guidance. In just getting a sense of whether I think you did say this was a timing issue but if you could just walk us through if this is a timing and the professional services optic in the quarter was more of a leading indicator into the future of license billings growth.
Jim Tholen
Sure, Dmitry. Couple of things, one is, the projects are all different but as a general statement we do a lot of professional services on these projects before we have an opportunity to take revenue. We may or may not get software billings, software order while we are in that pre-revenue process. If we do it's generally not that large and then, once we have hit a revenue milestone for PS, we will continue to do, we may well continue to do PS unless always we will be. But we are now in a revenue recognition mode and then the software starts getting ordered on a capacity need basis by the customer so yes I think it is absolutely a leading indicator of software in the long term, yes I think it will help drive software revenue growth in 2016, but it is really a driver for software in 2016, 2017 & 2018. These are again long term multi-million projects.
Dmitry Netis
Okay, very good and my last question follows the first two and that is, despite that $7 million pulled forward, you still provided a very nice revenue guide on organic basis even excluding that $7 million to $8 million contribution from Transera, so that begs the question, what have you seen elsewhere and clearly, that project will then, you had strength across other verticals of businesses, what is it that you saw, you did mention that Europe was going to be strong coming to 2016, what are some of the strengths you saw through the quarter that gave you confidence to guide up for the year?
Jim Tholen
Sure, let me give you some thoughts Dmitry and I will have Mike kick in as well, is one, just to be clear, we didn't pull the $7 million deal, we achieved a revenue milestone that had us recognizing the revenue. Actually in some way it would have helped the 2016 vs 2015 on both sides had it been in 2016 but overall market question I think is an important one and I think we are just in this very nice secular growth market and this business that 5% to 10% penetrated in our most penetrated market with clearly, and enterprise demand is going from its state to hosted and from voice to multi modal communications all using capabilities like ours and we have unique opportunity through the 700 channels worldwide to exploit this and so I think what you are seeing in the guide is just combination of the great market opportunity and for us a really enviable market position to take advantage of.
Michael Tessler
Sure, Jim. And let me add, Dmitry, I will summarize three main observations that made us think about and then built our guidance for 2016. First of all, I think Jim said in his remarks, overall yield through the current channel has increased so the actual take rates to our channels as we exit in 2015 certainly is on the rise. So that's one, obviously one of the biggest drivers for our business is the existing channels falling through more seats. The second observation is that we are seeing more and more of our channels move upmarket so the overall addressable space is increasing so the number of customers who were in the aft of the SMB are now moving into mid-market and then to the larger enterprise space, so we are seeing a broader set of offers from our existing channels and I say the third, has given us quite a bit of confidence is that we were obviously engaged in a number of launches through the year with our customers. Some of those as I said in my remarks will be fixed mobile or mobile only offers. We think those are offers that are extremely attractive in the market. I think bringing mobile to the UCAS market is a huge driver of growth and I think we have a number of very interesting launches planned with a number of our customers through 2016. Those will be the three observations that drove our guidance for 2016.
Dmitry Netis
Nice, that's very helpful, thanks gentlemen. Keep up the good work. 
Michael Tessler
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Tavis McCourt
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Jim first a clarification, can you repeat the BroadCloud revenue either in Q4 or full year 2015 and then should we expect bookings growth and if you will comment on the level of bookings growth in 2016, that'd be helpful? And then finally Mike, strategic question. You mentioned the co-branding initiative which is interesting, I don't know if you have done that before but I guess strategically, what does a carrier find interesting about that? I would imagine it will make it harder for them to differentiate if they are all bidding on similar projects, all of them powered by BroadSoft logo, the beauty of the white label model was it that it allowed the carrier to at least create some differentiation for the customers, so talk us through strategically carrier perspectives, why the co-branding makes sense? Thanks.
Jim Tholen
Sure, Tavis. The revenue for Q4 was $8.7 million. The year was around $35 million and on billings for 2016, yes, I absolutely expected the billings growth in 2016.
Michael Tessler
So let me cover your second question on the co-branding side. I think one of the things we have seen and the customers have seen especially with the move and demand in the larger customer, larger enterprise segment is that the customers want to know and often we get engaged in those discussions since the customers want to know the technology that is powering the service providers technology and as we move upmarket, I think you are absolutely correct, I think in the small segment, the carriers often don't need our brand as we move into medium-large, they need a brand to be able to point to and defend kind of their technology choices as the customers are doing their evaluations. I think that we are engaged with the number of these customers not simply just co-branding but also along the co-branding working with them on the overall market. Bringing them the digital content that they can use in these product launches and sales, selling efforts to these specific segments. I think we will see us working with a number of selected partners who have decided that the co-branding is interesting to them, that they get a benefit from the relationship where we co-brand and provide the content to them and help them in the selling process and I think you will see this a selective relationship process around the world. So, I am not going to see every one of our customers in every segments using this co-branding opportunity.
Tavis McCourt
Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
George Notter
Hi, thanks a lot guys and congratulations on a terrific quarter and a year. If I wanted to nitpick on the print it would be on the year-on-year growth in the billings number overall, I guess 8% year-on-year growth as I look at it here but I think you eluded us on the call, I think a year ago comparison was particularly big and can you walk us through what drove that year ago comparison and is there a deal or project I can pull out of that year comp to get a better look at what the kind of billings growth would be?
Jim Tholen
And so George, you talking overall or you talking about the software line.
George Notter
I was looking for the overall but you can answer the question both ways if it makes sense.
Jim Tholen
Yes, so the biggest part of 2014 was that Delta was a very, very large project outside of the US and where we had modest billings this year. The second was especially with, if you remember, we said a monster Q4 billings number in '14 with a lot of year end budget buying activity and we didn't see really overall nearly as much this year and we certainly -- there is opacity of budget buying out of Europe or this Q4. It didn't trust me because the sell through was really pretty healthy but less -- just less buying and I think you see little bit of that in the guidance for Q1 to be honest, if Q1 can be a little scary for us just coming off a very hard Q4. So I think there was a specific project in '14 that were large in either revenue or billing, I think that '15 really was a much more down the middle of the fairway year and quarter in Q4 with -- and again, with less interest as I said outside the U.S. opacity of budget buying at the end of the year.
George Notter
Got it, okay. And if I were to try to quantify this and maybe -- I know this is not easy to do but normalized for the project in the year ago quarter and then normalized for the differential in year-end buying. I mean what I'd be looking at billings, growth rates that are consistent with what you saw in Q2 or Q3?
Jim Tholen
I mean that's like -- that's a lot of simultaneous equation to a number. I mean, I guess what I'd tell you and you can see to me in the guide going into '16 is, I think the overall year numbers are more representative than the quarter numbers. I think that North America was very strong and I think historically strong. I do think Europe was wide in the year and definitely in the quarter, we address for all of that. Yes, I mean -- look I think that it was underlying tone of the business it continues to be very strong, I think you see that both in Q1 and 2016.
George Notter
Very good, thank you guys very much.
Jim Tholen
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein Cowen. Your line is now open.
Paul Silverstein
Thanks guys. Can you hear me okay?
Michael Tessler
Yes.
Paul Silverstein
Jim, can you give us a regional mix, geographic?
Jim Tholen
Okay. Now I didn't hear you Paul. What was that?
Paul Silverstein
Can you give us the regional max, the geographic revenue?
Jim Tholen
Yes. For the quarter, North America was -- North America is up $59 million, EMEA $13 million, rest of -- I'm sorry, it's actually about $66 million; EMEA, $13 million; rest of the world, $10 million.
Paul Silverstein
North America, $66 million; EMEA, $13 million; rest of the world, $10 million?
Jim Tholen
Yes.
Paul Silverstein
That's all right. Now with transformation deals, the last time we tried to figure totals around nine, how many are known revenue? How many are total and how many opportunities are out there that XP awarded?
Jim Tholen
So I don't know we've got that specific but I'd say that -- I mean it's hard to say about half when it's nine but about half of them are in some form of revenue recognition and four to five and the others are not in revenue recognition mode yet. Of those I think there is -- there continue to be many opportunities either in harper or not announced. So I think that continues to be robust opportunity as more and more carriers are kind of commit to transforming their networks to IP.
Paul Silverstein
Jim, I'm not asking you for the names obviously, I trust you don't want enough from it now but you just -- if I heard you correct, will you just pulled us that there originals that you've actually have already been awarded over and above what you've referenced on previous calls. Is that accurate?
Jim Tholen
Correct. We have not told you about all the deal.
Paul Silverstein
All right. I will pass it on but I want to ask one last question, on the BroadCloud margins, if you said my apologies, but can you tell us what it was in the quarter? And do you still expect once you get the benefit of volume and have you invest upfront investment that eventually trends down? I understand you're still building up data centers but do you still see 70% to 80% gross margin from BroadCloud? I think the last time you spoke, you had referenced that 2017 timeframe and you expected to see the meaningful improvement. Is that still the case or is that going to push down?
Jim Tholen
I'm sorry, the gross margin you were looking for was specific to the SAS [ph] business Paul.
Paul Silverstein
Correct, correct.
Jim Tholen
So what we said on the call was; in the quarter it was mid-30s and yes, I do think that once we get to scale as run rate business, cost that GOs where we're making the investment that as business should be north of 70% gross margin business.
Paul Silverstein
Do you still see that in '17?
Jim Tholen
No, I think we're going to track hopefully towards that in '17. I think '17 will clearly make progress whether we'll make it 70% in '17, its TBD.
Paul Silverstein
All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Jess Lubert
Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a nice quarter and outlook. A couple here; can you maybe just comment on customer inventory levels relative to historical trend, it sounds like industry sell-through's accelerating but you didn't see much budget buying. Do you think we might see some catch-up spending over the next couple of quarters, any thoughts there?
Jim Tholen
So I think the math -- you're correct, overall it would appear that sell-through growth rates were higher than the sell-in growth rates, and that was particularly true in Europe. And so I think that that math would suggest that capacity -- unused capacity held by customers is a lower than it has been previously, certainly lower than year ago. And I do think -- we pointed out even in the script that certainly for Europe where that was more pronounced, I think that's an example of where we think we'll continue to see solid growth on software but I think it is helpful.
Jess Lubert
And then on the network transformation projects, can you help us understand what percentage of an average deal is likely to come from professional services versus licenses?
Jim Tholen
Yes, it does vary but it can be as high as 40% professional services for the win project.
Jess Lubert
So pretty big license opportunity above and beyond what we've already seen with professional services for some of these big deals that have already had?
Jim Tholen
Yes, absolutely. And I won't say there are no projects that are all or predominantly professional services. We just don't -- that's not our business.
Jess Lubert
And then Jim, just last one for me. Can you help us understand when you look at 2016 how you're balancing the need to invest versus growth to what extent revenue upside is likely to fall through like we saw in 2015? And if you can help us understand where the bulk of incremental investment is likely to be focused there? Should we be thinking it's mostly sales and marketing, how that kind of flows through to sales, R&D and G&A. Any kind of thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks.
Jim Tholen
Yes. So I mean let me answer the first, the second first. So the focus of investment in '16 is on the sales and marketing side, really on -- again, on sell-through, really working with our customers to increase their capability to market pricing. I think we've seen some amount of success in our ability to carry us in that regard. And then in continued innovation, so it's investment in our cloud service, clearly investment in the entire area of user experience and mobility. And then incrementally investment with things like our Transera acquisition and geographic in Federal Government critical growth on cloud. In terms of turning the knob with Federal revenue outperformance which I think was your other question, we can do and we will do some of that although, we -- depending on the tone of the business that's an incremental decision based at the time on, really and it's much more what the year looks like not on an individual quarter. I hope that answers the question.
Jess Lubert
Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Richard Valera
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Jim, a couple of quick one's for you. First is, all the Transera revenue in the fast line?
Jim Tholen
Almost, yes, that's actually yes.
Richard Valera
Great. And then I think you said you expected slight growth in prof services in '16 off of which is obviously a very tough comp in '15. And I'm guessing the way you would expect to get there was to actually see probably pretty solid growth, maybe in the first three quarters of the year and then perhaps a down quarter in the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?
Jim Tholen
Yes, that's a right way to think about it.
Richard Valera
Great. And then Mike, just wanted to you to give us an update on what you're seeing out there competitively? Has anything changed particularly, has Microsoft's Skype for business become anymore of a factor in the market? Has anything changed as you've sort of seen a somewhat of a shift towards the more mobile centric deployment by your customers?
Michael Tessler
Yes, I think there is a lot of innovation in the marketplace. I think a lot of the moves by both Microsoft and some of the moves by Cisco, identifying clearly Cloud as the future delivery means but there are strategies to go a little bit more in terms of likely direct as basically packaging everything up and selling to the enterprise has actually in fact helped our relationships, strengthening our relationships with the service provider community, getting them more focused on building and launching more and more services into a variety of segments. So I'd say that with competitive positioning into the carrier space, probably better.
Obviously, we are very focused with our service provider partners and building extremely competitive products to compete with the likes of above Cisco and Microsoft where we see them as being along with the service providers, the two others that are clearly going to have some scale whereas most of the legacy other players will kind of struggle in the migration to cloud. And very much migration to cloud and mobile where obviously our service provider customers have a very unique competitive advantage in the -- in what enterprises are looking for.
Richard Valera
Great, thanks for that Mike. I appreciate it.
Michael Tessler
Welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is now open.
Catharine Trebnick
Thank you, and thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter, gentlemen. Mine is on the channel, that was one of your strategic initiatives in 2016, couple of questions here. Are you developing enterprise organization that will focus on the co-branding piece of the carriers? And then the second piece of the question is, are you looking at alternative providers also such as like the AOLs of the world that would also push into the mid-market. Thanks.
Michael Tessler
Hi Catharine, thanks for the question. I think first of all, in the -- and what I would call the overall sell-through co-branding side, we are investing in a number of ways with the selected customers on building marketing, digital marketing assets, digital campaigns. And then also some overweight sales functions that would help those service providers launch and be more effective in the marketplace. So very much an important part of our strategy going forward is making our existing channels as successful as possible, we'll shift those the -- some of those will shift to carriers that have FMC launches and those that are co-branding with us, so that's an important part.
I'd say on the Ultra what I mean -- let me just recall, Ultra Net were kind of non-traditional service provider channels. We are -- have a couple of experiments going on trying to service the large rented prices around the world. We hear in many cases service providers are not well positioned and some of the channels that you mentioned are looking to become like service providers into those in road segments. So we are looking at expansion by what we would consider the channel through '16.
Catharine Trebnick
All right, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Michael Latimore
Hi, great. Thanks a lot. I mean on the 30% or so sell-through, that's a little bit of an acceleration I believe. Can you remind me what was that a year ago?
Jim Tholen
I mean it's been running in that I think high 20% to 30%.
Michael Latimore
Okay. And then I guess, the license, billings growth, I think it was 15% this year, I think it was -- maybe 14% the year before. I guess, should license billing growth eventually sink up with sell-through or what's the correlation here I guess?
Jim Tholen
It's clearly correlated but one really caught a SaaS concept and the other is capacity expansion concept. So I think generally software license revenue will be -- is correlated to but will be lower than sell-through.
Michael Latimore
And then just on, I guess on the BroadCloud growth for the year, I mean as most of the organic growth coming from current customers expanding or is the big chunk of the organic growth will see some of the new customers still coming online?
Jim Tholen
So it's definitely a mix that -- I said it's fast, so the predominance really is going to be on people that are up and running and kind of with momentum. At the beginning of the year it's just hard for a new customer to move that needle in '16, they're going to layer on more for '17 and '16.
Michael Latimore
Okay. Thanks.
Jim Tholen
Sure.
Operator
