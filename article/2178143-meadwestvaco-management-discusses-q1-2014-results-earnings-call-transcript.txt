Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the first quarter results conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Rose, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski are here to review our first quarter results, and we also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.
The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today, but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.
John A. Luke
Jason, thanks very much, and good morning to all of you. I'm pleased to report that we began the year well with first quarter results significantly better than last year. We had sales growth of 3% on a constant-currency basis. And we're in $0.23 per share on an adjusted basis compared to $0.09 per share during the same period last year, even with adverse weather-related impacts of $25 million during this quarter.
As important, we increased profitability in each of our Packaging businesses. We're focused on ensuring that progress with our profitable growth strategy becomes even more evident in our bottom line performance, where we have targeted market-leading margins in each business. This includes expanding our commercial and innovation efforts to win in chosen global markets, capturing the value of our recent investments and getting more efficient and productive by reducing costs and improving manufacturing performance. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on each count in the first quarter, giving us confidence that we have the strategies in place to reach our immediate and longer-term performance goals. I'll touch on a few of the highlights for the first quarter that you'll hear more about as Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski share more detailed results.
First, we're winning with our disciplined end market participation strategies, including market share gains, sales of innovative products and growth with top customers as they expand in key regions around the world. Our progress in these areas is evident in each of our businesses. It is particularly notable in the very positive results in Home, Health & Beauty. Under new leadership for this segment, adjusted EBITDA margins reached 14% in the first quarter due to expanded market participation with innovative high-margin products, a more productive manufacturing platform and a leaner cost structure. The progress in this business is sustainable, and you'll hear from Bob and Mark about how we expect to build on this performance to drive further improvement in this segment, as well as similar themes that led to margin expansion in Food & Beverage and industrial packaging compared to last year.
Second, we're capitalizing on the recent investments in Brazil and in Covington, both of which had a meaningful positive impact on our results in the quarter and will help accelerate improvement this year. During the first quarter, we generated 24% EBITDA margins in Brazil, just shy of the range we've targeted for later in the year. The Tres Barras mill investment continues to drive margin improvement in the Industrial business, and we've also been effectively driving pricing increases for our innovative corrugated solutions and high-quality paperboard in Brazil.
Looking at our other large capital investment, the biomass boiler in Covington, we generated towers throughout the quarter, which was at or above the capacity we expected, which led to an incremental $8 million of productivity in our Food & Beverage segment, very much on target with the returns planned for this project.
Similar improvements were evident across our manufacturing system as we operated very well during the quarter, notwithstanding isolated disruptions from the severe storms in the southeastern United States.
Third, we delivered on the expected elements of the margin improvement program we announced in January. We generated $9 million of savings in the quarter and completed actions that ensure we'll reach our goal of at least $75 million in savings this year. There's more we will accomplish as part of the cost discipline that's now ingrained across the company, as well as pending actions such as our decision to sell 2 small facilities in Europe. This decision is notable not for the size of the transactions, but for the determined focus that we have on improving margins by optimizing our mix of products and services.
In all, we're encouraged by the continued progress across MWV and the momentum we've carried into the second quarter. We believe the impact of our strategy to win in global packaging markets, as well as in Specialty Chemicals is more evident now than it may have been in recent quarters when operating challenges masked our progress. For these reasons, we're confident we will deliver significantly improved earnings and cash flow for the full year.
I'll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for some additional commentary about our performance and outlook in each segment before Mark Rajkowski talks about the first quarter financials. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Thank you, John. The strong first quarter performance that John noted is a good indicator of the progress we are making, especially the margin expansion of each of the businesses. More to do to reach our goals, but we are confident given the progress we are making across the company with our market participation strategies, our manufacturing operations and our cost discipline. I'd now like to step through each of the segments with some brief highlights for the first quarter, as well as our outlook for further improvement in the second quarter and beyond.
In Food & Beverage, earnings increased significantly on modestly higher sales. The negative $25 million weather impact that John mentioned at the outset was concentrated in this segment, largely resulting from higher fiber costs and availability issues at the mills, higher purchased energy costs, as well as interruptions to many of our customers' operations across the U.S. A more detailed breakdown is available in the slides that accompany this call.
All in, EBITDA margin in the first quarter rose to 14%, up 180 basis points versus prior year. If not for the weather impact, EBITDA margin for Food & Beverage would have been another 300 basis points higher for the quarter.
Despite the weather issues, solid operating performance, strong SBS and CNK board demand and our pricing and product mix strategies drove improved performance in Food & Beverage. Pricing was up by $22 million as the result of steady commercial efforts over the past year to price according to the value we deliver to customers. We continue to gain share with global brand owners and are making good inroads with innovative new products, such as Evertain and SmartFare, paperboard packaging products for snack foods and ready-to-eat meals, both of which will be launched this year.
We are also benefiting from packaging machinery placements that have been a key part of our strategy to grow in global beverage markets, growing carton volumes when we secure these critical positions in our customers' bottling and fulfillment operations.
In the first quarter, we had a particularly good win with machinery placement in Northern China, representing new geographic expansion, where our strategic customers are generating the majority of their growth.
In the second quarter, we expect Food & Beverage profits to be significantly above last year's levels. Our paperboard order backlog should remain very strong, and we will continue to benefit from higher pricing across multiple product lines. Margins will also benefit from the ongoing productivity impact from our Covington biomass boiler, as well as lower outage expenses compared to last year.
Turning to Home, Health & Beauty, sales in earnings were up strongly, and our 14% EBITDA margin increased by 350 basis points. This improvement is despite $3 million of unfavorable impact from our personal care folding carton businesses in Europe and Brazil, which we will be exiting fully in the second quarter as previously announced.
As John mentioned, the solid progress in this segment is the result of our market participation strategies taking hold under new leadership, as well as improved operating performance and lower overhead costs.
Across the range of our dispensing solutions for home cleaning, lawn and garden maintenance, health care, personal care and fragrance, we saw anywhere from 10% to 20% revenue growth compared to last year. We also had solid growth in our health care adherence solutions with the transition to our Shellpak Renew, and all paperboard package completed during the quarter.
A great example of our progress in Home, Health & Beauty is in the fragrance market. We won a record number of new product launches over the past year, many of them with our innovative Melodie pump and new Emotions of Spray Collection. These launches have resulted in increased unit volume, up almost 25% compared to last year, which has contributed to our overall revenue and earnings improvement.
We have positioned Home, Health & Beauty as a partner to major brand owners worldwide, and we are winning a sizable share of new product launches, not just in fragrance, but in all of our markets because of our increasing ability to deliver innovative solutions with a highly responsive global supply chain.
In the second quarter, we expect Home, Health & Beauty earnings to be significantly higher than last year. We've seen strong demand continue into the second quarter and the drag on earnings from our European and Brazilian folding carton businesses will be substantially reduced as we complete the exit and focus on dispensing solutions.
With our solidifying market positions globally, improved productivity and lower costs from our margin improvement activities, we are on a good path for a sustained, strong performance and improvement in this segment.
In industrial packaging, dollar-based sales were down slightly, but earnings and margins increased significantly as we continued to ramp up the business following our major investments. Specifically in Brazil, sales were slightly down in dollars, but up 14% on a constant-currency basis, taking into consideration the devaluation of the Brazilian real.
EBITDA margin during the first quarter grew to 24%, up 600 basis points year-on-year and just below the target of 25% to 30% that we expect to achieve by the end of this year.
We continue to improve the performance of our expanded mill in Tres Barras, which has increased our supply of premium, quality kraft liner for internal use and external sales. The mill has achieved its design capacity, and we are making excellent progress optimizing costs, quality and output.
In addition, the quality and value of our innovative corrugated packaging solutions have enabled us to increase pricing in order to offset significant inflation from rising fiber costs, labor and other input costs.
In India, we continue to like the fundamentals of the corrugated packaging markets as the country continues to move toward modern retail and the middle class expands rapidly. Earnings in the short term have been a modest drag on overall segment profitability, but we see this as a long-term position ahead of the expected growth as we continue to optimize performance and capacity of the mill operation that we acquired about a year ago.
Industrial segment profits are expected to improve strongly again in the second quarter versus last year. And beyond, with continued optimization of our investments in Brazil and India, increasing productivity and our commercial focus, we will continue to drive upward momentum for this segment.
And finally, our Specialty Chemicals business continues to execute extremely well in driving growth and profitability in its key markets. Unfavorable market dynamics, specifically in the general pine chemicals sector, negatively impacted sales in the quarter, but were more than offset by growth and strong performance in our higher value applications for road paving, adhesives, oil drilling and activated carbon technologies. For the quarter, EBITDA margin remained very strong at 25%.
In the second quarter, we expect segment profit in Specialty Chemicals to be modestly higher than the strong second quarter last year as we continue to leverage stronger positions in each of our high-end product lines.
So to summarize, we are seeing solid improvement in Packaging and continued strong performance in Specialty Chemicals. We know that there's more work to be done, but clearly, we've established good momentum more broadly across the enterprise that we are confident can carry us toward our performance expectations.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results, including progress on the margin improvement actions we announced in January. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Bob. As you've heard, we're off to a very good start in 2014. All of our business segments delivered earnings growth in the quarter, including substantial improvement in operating margins for each of our Packaging businesses.
Building on the momentum we established in the fourth quarter of last year and through this first quarter, which is a seasonally slower period for many of our markets, we expect segment profit and cash flow to improve significantly in the second quarter and throughout this year. As John and Bob noted, our overall goal is to expand our margins and deliver market-leading profitability in each business.
To accelerate our progress in achieving this goal, we announced specific actions in January to simplify organization design, refine our participation in some markets and resize our corporate cost relative to the revenue base following our Consumer & Office Products and forestland transactions.
By the end of the first quarter, we had largely completed all of our actions, enabling us to achieve cost savings of $9 million. These savings were the primary driver of the 6% reduction in SG&A and resulted in 80 basis points of improvement to operating margin. The savings from this program will grow as we move through the year and reach at least $75 million in total savings by the end of 2014.
Our improvement in the quarter, however, went far beyond our cost-reduction activities. We continue to build on a strong foundation of commercial success and significantly ramped up our operational execution to deliver solid, underlying financial performance for the quarter.
Looking at sales revenue, we made tremendous progress on the pricing front, which was the largest driver of our currency-neutral sales growth of 3%. We continued to demonstrate the value of our differentiated innovative solutions with over $40 million of additional price and mix contribution in the quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to build on our commercial successes with new share gains, led by the strong performance in Home, Health & Beauty, where sales volumes of our plastic pumps and dispensers grew 11% year-over-year.
In the Food & Beverage segment, sales volumes were significantly impacted during the quarter by the extreme weather, which led to shipping and logistics challenges, as well as customers shutting down their operations during the storms. To give you some perspective, sales volumes were down 12% and 9% in January and February, respectively, but up 17% in March as the weather improved and our customers replenished their supply chains. Activity has continued near those levels so far in the second quarter.
Adjusted EBIT increased 72% to $98 million, and EBIT margins increased 310 basis points to 7.4%. Adjusted gross margin represented the majority of the improvement, growing 240 basis points to 19% of sales, largely due to price and mix, as well as higher productivity as we've begun to realize the benefits from our renewed focus on manufacturing excellence to drive high-quality and highly efficient production and service.
Our productivity efforts and increased operating leverage contributed $25 million to adjusted EBIT during the quarter, which includes the significant negative impact from weather. This reflects benefits from increased operating rates and lower cost per ton for our production at our Tres Barras mill in Brazil, as well as $8 million of benefits from the new biomass boiler at Covington.
Finally, our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was approximately $330 million compared to just over $1 billion at year end. Approximately $525 million was used to return value to our shareholders, including the repurchase of shares and dividends. We also had to pay about $100 million of alternative minimum tax on the installment note from the forestland sale. We will recover this payment with AMT credits over the next 3 years.
Our first quarter also includes the seasonal buildup of working capital for the busy spring and summer seasons for many of our businesses, including beverage, food service and home and garden. The build in working capital this year was exacerbated by the severe weather over the first 2 months of the quarter, which required us to produce and ship at near record levels in March to meet our -- to meet pent-up customer demand.
We expect working capital to return to more normalized levels in the second quarter as operating conditions have improved. So we look ahead to further progress in the second quarter, we expect company earnings to be significantly higher than last year. Bob has detailed our outlook for each segment. Taken together, we expect higher earnings and cash flow as we enter the busier season for many of our businesses, benefiting from improved productivity, higher pricing and additional savings from our cost reduction programs.
John, back to you.
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks very much. In conclusion, we're making progress, but our work is far from complete. We're executing on strategies that will drive higher earnings and cash flow from our businesses and greater returns to our shareholders. We look forward to reporting on continued success next quarter and for the balance of the year as we work to achieve market-leading margins in each of our businesses. We'd now be happy to answer any questions you might have and in addition to Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski, as Jason noted upfront, Bob Feeser is with us as well.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division
John, 2 things. You talked quite a bit about successes in value-based pricing. With respect to how much further you can go, where do you think you still have the biggest gaps in value-based pricing, whether is it specific customersâ geographies or product categories? And then the second question, you've been winning for so long in Specialty Chemicals. I don't think anybody's target hasn't been beaten at this point. How clear are the opportunities to continue to grow that business and how dependent is it in, like, for saying -- for sake of China, is it really a function of a new market opening up for you?
John A. Luke
You've got a lot packed in there, Mark, and I will do my best and invite my colleagues to follow up because I think you've hit on key points we'd like to reinforce. First of all, we see significant upside across the board in terms of value-based pricing. Value-based pricing is really going to be a function of how well we engage through commercial excellence with our customers to continue to understand their discrete as well as broad-based needs, how well we meet them with quality and service and, importantly, how effectively we innovate our current -- improve our current offerings and bring new innovations to bear that help our customers grow in their markets. So whether it is a food marketplace, where we see significant potential, whether it's continuing innovation, growth in service supporting the beverage marketplace, which is growing nicely globally, and certainly, Home, Health & Beauty where, as we said, what you've just seen is the tip of the iceberg, we see significant potential and it's not only here, but it is global. So we look forward to -- I don't mean to say it's easy, but it -- we see significant upside potential, and it just reinforces the broader areas of the strategy that we're embarked on. With respect to Chemical, I think Bob Beckler highlighted a lot. But this is an excellent business. It's one where we see significant upside potential as we look at the global trends that are underway through here, again, through a combination of innovation and thoughtful investment to support expansion and participation in markets. We see significant upside potential both in terms of revenues, as well as underlying profitability. Mark, Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Well, John, just picking up on Specialty Chemicals first, and then maybe an added comment on pricing. I think you said it well on Chemical. I don't think we should view that the business has popped out by any means, and we don't necessarily need a new breakthrough in that business to continue growing from the current base. The comments that I made in the prepared remarks were really to highlight that we continue to see tremendous upside in the higher-end premium part of that business that serves the specialized markets like asphalt, oilfield, adhesives and activated carbon markets. We still have a lot of capability there in terms of mix to shift from more of our general markets into the specialty markets there. Just coming back to the price question, we have pricing activity underway in all of our segments today. And I think what you saw in the first quarter was really largely carryover pricing from activities that occurred in 2013. So there's still more pricing benefit to come throughout the year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Previously, you had provided EBITDA guidance for this year, 1.025 to 1.075. Obviously, the weather hit things in the first quarter by about $25 million. Does that mean that we should be at 1 to 1.05 or are some of the other improving trends and performances enough that, in fact, you could potentially keep that range where it had been previously?
John A. Luke
Mark, I'll pass you over to Mark here to address your comments.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Mark, yes. Listen, we -- obviously, weather was not helpful this quarter. But as you saw, we recovered some of that in the quarter as a function of some of the outstanding work we've done in the commercial areas. Pricing really turning around our operating performance, starting to realize as we said we would the benefits from the investments that we've made in Brazil, in Covington. And with that, some real momentum that we're seeing in the underlying commercial markets, we still have good confidence in our ability to deliver on our full-year plan.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Just sticking with the weather a little bit. I guess, the comps should be fairly easy, but last year, you had a pretty rough year with home and garden. I was just wondering, can you give any insight into maybe some of your most weather-exposed segments as you look at still kind of the colder [ph] spring in big parts of the country?
John A. Luke
Sure. Bob Beckler, you've been close to that.
Robert K. Beckler
Yes, I think from a Q1 results standpoint, most of the weather impact we would say was in the Food & Beverage segment for the reasons I outlined in my comments. There was minor impact across the other segments due to disruptions in logistics and customer activities and demand. And I think some of our customers would claim weather impacts to the consumer end in terms of consumer spending patterns during the first 2 months. But we saw a very strong bounce back in the month of March that encouraged us about the fundamentals of the markets that we were participating in, and that's continued forward into April. Specific to home and garden, weather is a -- it's a funny thing. It actually is the one thing that benefits us as we look forward because people will be out there buying more home and garden products, we believe, to repair the lawns and gardens that have been damaged by the foul weather this year.
John A. Luke
Yes, I think we'll see how the balance of the quarter goes. But all signs are based on early activity that we're seeing in the lawn and garden marketplace progress and momentum that, frankly, has been absent for the last few years.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And then in terms of pricing, can you just remind us, you mentioned, obviously, a lot of what we saw in the first quarter was actions taken last year. Specifically in terms of the board markets, the activity that's currently being recognized in the market, when will we expect that flow through your results?
John A. Luke
Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
So, Gail, the actions that are widely published, we're certainly right there with them, and we really expect to see that start to flow through partially in the second quarter and certainly fully by the midyear point and onward through the year.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. But is there a major hang-up with contracted volume that you wouldn't start to see it until next year such as the resets that you saw going into '14?
Robert K. Beckler
Yes, there is some of that, which is why it will not be a step change as we go into Q2. There is contractual business that we have that we're benefiting from today as a result of the actions taken last year. So there is a bit of a lag that we'll continue to see and benefit that will carry forward into 2015.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And just one last question on Brazil. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of the underlying market fundamentals given some of the challenges in the economy down there or some of it -- do you see a risk given some of the talk on energy? And how have you been dealing with that? I mean, have you been exporting more out of Brazil than maybe might have been in the initial plan? And if so, just how is that trending and how would you expect that to trend over the next few quarters?
John A. Luke
Bob, you're still up.
Robert K. Beckler
On Brazil, it's certainly been an interesting dynamic due to the factors, Gail, that you're pointing out well. I would say that we're executing quite well given the dynamic, and we always felt that we would have a lot of flexibility with our strategy. The investment that we made in the expansion of the Tres Barras mill, while ultimately intended to feed the growth and reintegration of our corrugated packaging business, it's something that we can manage with a lot of discipline over time so that we're creating the maximum value from the paperboard that we're producing, which I'll mention is going extremely well. We're very pleased with the quality and the level of differentiation that we're seeing with the paperboard in the markets. Your point around export is a good one. And actually, with the devaluation of the currency over the last year, that's aided the market dynamic in general. So we've been able to play that balance very nicely, I think, while keeping our religion about our market participation and keeping a good discipline around pricing as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. In Specialty Chemicals, did volume get any benefit from road repair work, given the increment weather in 1Q? Or do you expect any in 2Q?
Robert K. Beckler
Yes, great question. Very quick answer on that one. Q1 is seasonally low due to the colder weather, but we are seeing a strong pickup in orders heading into the Q2 as we would expect and maybe a little bit on the stronger side. Particularly good demand we're seeing in the Asian region in that business as we head into Q2.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Great. And in Brazil, it seems like volumes underperformed the overall market during the quarter. What drove that? And also a competitor of yours recently reported mid-30% EBITDA margins there. Over the long term, is that achievable for Rigesa?
Robert K. Beckler
So on the volume side, it really goes back to the comments I made earlier to Gail's questions. We're really keeping a fundamental discipline going around pricing to offset inflation in Brazil, which, as you know, is escalating general inflation in the 6% to 7% range, and fiber costs in Brazil pressuring the industry as a whole are at historical highs. So the net balance has been, I would say, some volume pressure on the corrugated side of our business, but good movement of paperboard to offset the corrugated, so net-net on the quarter, a neutral position. Pricing was, obviously, necessary and a benefit to our performance in the quarter, and actions are still ongoing that will play through the remainder of the year. The profitability trajectory, we still see ourselves heading towards 30%. We'll be approaching that as we complete the year. We feel very good about how our strategy is playing out, and we think we'll be right up there in terms of the peer set in Brazil as we get into 2015.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And just one last one. Are you expecting any lingering impact from weather on 2Q earnings at all?
John A. Luke
Yes, very modest, very modest on the buck [ph] side.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.
John P. Babcock - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
This is actually John sitting in for George, sorry about that. Just have a quick question with regards to comments. I was just wondering, can you remind us on the return you're expecting from that project?
John A. Luke
Bob Feeser, you've been a part of all of that. Why don't you pick it up by commenting broadly on the trajectory and what we're seeing on the bottom line already?
Robert A. Feeser
John, this is Bob Feeser. We're still targeting mid-teens for that project in terms of returns, and we feel that we're on a very good pace and track to deliver that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Unknown Analyst
This is Usha Gunthapally [ph] on behalf of Alex. First question, are you seeing any increased competition for your paperboard in any of the markets from tonnage outside of North America?
John A. Luke
It's John. Let me comment broadly on -- if I understand the question fully. I think what we're seeing is that the positions we have targeted and are actively pursuing through our commercial strategies have minimized the competitive exposure we've had to capacity additions that have occurred or excess capacity that exists in certain markets. And I think one that we watch most closely over the last few years has been China, where there's been a significant increase in board production. But again, the specialized market positions we've worked to develop most notably in high-end tobacco and liquid packaging have insulated us. We don't take that insulation for granted. We work very hard through innovation and performance to protect it. So I think our strategy is serving us well.
Unknown Analyst
That's helpful color. And just for the Industrials business, what is the run rate sales or EBITDA you expect out of this business in 2014? You talked about margin, but I'm just curious, like around sales [ph] or EBITDA?
John A. Luke
Which segment? I'm sorry.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Industrial.
John A. Luke
Industrial, okay. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Mark, you commented...
E. Mark Rajkowski
We're at 24%. And as we said we expect to be and Bob just mentioned as well, we expect to be moving towards 30% by the end of this year.
Unknown Analyst
Got it. And one last one and I'll turn it over. So for Home, Health & Beauty segment, a nice margin improvement in the first quarter, is this a good run rate to use for rest of the year?
John A. Luke
I think we feel like it's certainly a good start to the year. But we still have some work to do in that segment. We believe there's still some upside to the profitability. So 14% EBITDA. That's a business that we would expect to reach the 17 range over time, and we're well on our way to reaching that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research.
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
My first one is on the Home, Health & Beauty segment. With that segment doing significantly better especially in pricing, are you rethinking the size of your cost reduction programs in Home, Health & Beauty?
John A. Luke
Let me comment at the outset. I think we feel that our cost-reduction initiatives, importantly, our margin expansion initiatives, which include a healthy combination of cost reduction and pricing discipline, supported by actions in the marketplace, as well as innovation strategies, very much on target, and we're not, in any way, lessening our resolve there. And I think, as Bob Beckler has commented, we see we have a number of things to continue to do, and we see significant continuing upside potential in that business. And Bob?
James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Very good. And then switching gears, we've heard a lot about transportation issues from multiple other companies given the rough winter. Could you help us quantify what the transportation impact in the quarter was? And are you seeing that improve at all?
John A. Luke
Bob Feeser, do you have a comment...
Robert A. Feeser
Yes. This is Bob Feeser. On that point, so we announced $25 million of weather-related impacts. Transportation was a smaller portion of that in our -- across our operations. We certainly did have some challenges with both rail and truck, primarily truck, in several of our operations. But we've actually seen some improvement as we moved into the second quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just, I guess, a higher level question just to start on in Food & Beverage. Have you seen fundamental shift in buying behavior on the consumer side, which is responsible for the uptick that you're seeing right now after a couple of years of struggle?
Robert K. Beckler
This is Bob Beckler, Paul. I'll start the answer to that one, and invite others to join in. I think, I wouldn't say that there has been a step change, but I think we're making excellent progress in terms of how we think about our participation in those markets. We worked very hard over the last couple of years to sharpen our participation and deepen our insights into where to play in general in both Food & Beverage that I think have benefited us a lot, even when the market conditions have not always been so favorable. Having said that, there are some bright spots that we see, and just to name a few, on the bleached board side, generally, positive trend in cup and plate food service items, as paperboard is gaining some share against plastic and foam, would be one example. We participate in the liquid packaging markets with high-quality paperboard, and that's probably the fastest-growing application today for bleached paperboard. And on the beverage side, while there are some challenges in terms of the market fundamentals in North America around carbonated softdrinks, we're actually performing well in both carbonated softdrinks, and I would say especially, globally, on beer. So I think it's not a step change just to sum it up, but more of a continuation of the excellent progress that we're making, and really the focused commercial discipline that we have.
John A. Luke
Yes. I think Bob you've nailed that well, and I would just use this as an opportunity to say that I think our extended team has really, in each of these areas and around the globe, has really invested heavily in understanding the markets and the markets' dynamics very carefully and very well. So that the things, the ideas, the projects, the products we're bringing to market are targeted just that much more carefully to areas where we can achieve a volume and pricing improvement that we value.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then just on Home, Health & Beauty, I got the improvement of 350 basis points. What was the European beauty drag?
John A. Luke
The drag was between Europe and Brazil as we transitioned there with 150 basis points.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay, that's great. And you outlined lower tobacco sales down 10%. Is that a sign of a global contraction in cigarette consumption?
John A. Luke
No, I think there are some unusual circumstances here. Bob Feeser will comment on that.
Robert A. Feeser
Yes, I think it's more of a reflection of timing. So going into the fourth quarter of 2013, we had a number of customers that built some inventory, in particular, in Japan and in Korea, where there were some new tax regulation that was impacting in the fourth quarter. So some of what we saw in the first quarter was definitely timing-related and inventory readjustments in the first quarter. We continue to see actually very robust demand in the tobacco market, in particular, in the China tobacco market as we head into the second quarter. So our backlogs in that business are actually quite strong.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay. So overall, I guess, the information you guys have got on in terms of tobacco business global growth, is that still positive sort of in the 2% to 3% growth range?
Robert A. Feeser
We probably would have it maybe a notch below that, maybe 1% to 3%, in that range. But again, where we're targeting to participate is really in the premium end of, in particular, of the China tobacco market, where there is still robust growth and we're well positioned to take advantage of that.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And just last question. Any news on joint -- your JV's online development?
John A. Luke
Steady as you go, I think we're off to a very good start. And nothing significant to report at this stage of the game. But everything is going well.

Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
A few questions, quickies. The $75 million cost reduction program, which you say is completed, can you tell us what the number of headcount reduction is and what the expected savings from that is?
John A. Luke
Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Joshua, the headcount reduction is, as we reported in the first quarter, in the 500 range.
John A. Luke
That is the bulk of the savings coming from headcount.
Robert K. Beckler
That's right.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
And that's like the 500 million or -- excuse me, 75. Okay, got that. Second question, you didn't say much about adherence packaging on this call. Can you tell us what's going on there and where it stands in terms of -- I guess, where it stands in priorities to the firm at this point?
John A. Luke
Well we're continuing to make progress on adherence. We've been at this now for several years. And it's one where we see really a tremendous amount of potential that still has yet to fully take hold for us. But we're still optimistic about the potential in that market. It's one that requires a real transformation in terms of how medications are dispensed. And we're at the forefront of that activity. But I think that's not going to be an overnight step-up in performance, but more of a slow and steady climb, and we're making progress.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Are the issues the FDA, is it the Wal-Mart, I mean, what is holding up the progress?
John A. Luke
Josh, I think, it's best to say that the regulatory environment is one that has afforded the change of the magnitude and pace that we and, frankly, I think others in the broader marketplace who would perhaps see the benefits from an adherence standpoint would like to see. So it's less retail. Wal-Mart has been a very good and effective partner for us in that business.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Next question, you talked about fiber cost in Brazil escalating. Now you have one of the finest fiber bases in Brazil and so on. But -- so question is, how integrated are you to this mill and are your fiber costs going up? Is it a log and haul going up or are you protected on your fiber cost?
John A. Luke
Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
It's a great question, Joshua. On virgin fiber, we're in excellent shape. We really do have a nice position with our highly productive forestlands in Brazil. And with the expansion of the mill that we referenced, we've been able to take advantage more fully of that, that fiber base. But there is still a component of purchased fiber in our business. I would say we're probably less exposed to -- than others in the industry, and that's the recycle OCC fiber that I was referencing earlier that is up about 40% to 45% from what we were paying 1 year ago. And that is the fiber material that we used to produce the medium grade paperboard for our corrugated products.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Would it be fair to guess that maybe OCC is about 10% of your furnish down there?
Robert K. Beckler
Maybe a little more than that, considering our paper balance because the medium is largely OCC. So I would say more in the 15% to 20% range.
Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Then I have to ask, what percentage, medium versus linerboard -- or, yes, what percentage medium versus linerboard?
Robert K. Beckler
It's about a 3:1 ratio.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Drake Johnstone with Davenport.
F. Drake Johnstone - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division
A question I have for you, based on your commentary, it looks like you'll move to positive cash from operations in the second quarter. It seems like your CapEx in the first quarter is trending lower than on a -- if we had -- multiply that times 4 based on your annual guidance of $350 million CapEx. So wonder if you had some thoughts on cash flow and free cash for the year. It looks like it's sort of back-end weighted. And also going into fiscal '15, can we see CapEx potentially down as low as $300 million?
John A. Luke
Mark, do you want to take that?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, I think our cash flow is back-end loaded. First quarter is very seasonal. It's a smaller quarter for us. We build working capital in the quarter to service our customers in the busy second, third quarter. We do expect to be positive in Q2 and for the full year. In terms of CapEx, we do spend a little bit more slowly in the first part of the year. It's a little bit heavier in the second half. We're still expecting to hit that roughly the $350 million. And as we get closer to -- through this year, we can give you more perspective in terms of how we're thinking about CapEx for '15.
F. Drake Johnstone - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division
And then my other question in your business in India, is that essentially a breakeven business this year or do you expect that to be mildly dilutive?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Essentially breakeven, slightly positive from an EBITDA perspective.
Jason Thompson
