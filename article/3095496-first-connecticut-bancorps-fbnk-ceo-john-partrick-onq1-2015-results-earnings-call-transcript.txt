Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and welcome to our call. Before we begin our presentation, weâd like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcement. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor afforded by that advisement. 
Thank you and now here is John Patrick, our Chairman, President and CEO.
John Patrick
Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us on this busy earnings day on our call. Overall, we released our earnings this morning at $0.17 a share year-over-year up $0.07 a share from earnings perspective. Weâre really pleased with the quarterly results and the significant improvement over the first quarter last year. I think itâs a tangible result of our focus on expenses as well as our continued strategy to grow organically in our markets and also our expansion into continuous markets. Thereâs really nothing exciting I would say about the quarter or even what weâre doing at our company other than focusing on the basics of growing our deposit base and making good loans and I think you see the ramifications of that with improvement in our asset quality increased actually a decrease over in our loan to deposit ratio which weâre focused on improving. Also the double-digit growth year-over-year in our loan book specifically the growth that weâve had in our C&I which I think everyoneâs aware that thatâs been a focus of ours.
Overall, from an asset perspective our pipeline our pipeline continue to remain strong and quite frankly in the mortgage banking side this quarter was much better than the quarter a year ago. However, we still had some weather-related challenges during the quarter, I think as everyone in the North East has, so we are pleased with our results there.
We are really focused also on maintaining our asset sensitivity of our balance sheet which will perform well in a rising interest rate environment who knows when that is going to be, there are some indications that may be this year but we are not waiting for that, we are going to continue to move forward with the strategy of growing our business prudently in our market as we talked about before.
We donât believe we need to go on the risks factor to enhance our asset growth any further than we are today. Again, asset quality continues to improve and we continue to see good opportunities in our market and contagious markets. I talked about the loans and deposits coming down 214% in the first quarter.
We have some strategies built around continuing to reduce that loan to deposit ratio as the year continuous to progress and despite the fact that our loan deposits went up for the quarter, we had a good growth again this year in net new accounts this quarter over quarter a year ago and Iâll remind everyone a year ago we had a new brand shed open and we always get little bit of pop with that where there are net new accounts.
So that is very encouraging from my perspective and the other thing that I think is encouraging when we take a look at our retail strategy that we embarked down a few years ago is that we talk a lot about what our net new account growth is quarter-to-quarter. But the fact that those are not mature customers and we continue to see terrific improvement in our services per household and in our five plus services customers have over 5 services with we measure it. 
Our quarter-to-quarter change is up pretty significantly at 12%. So weâre seeing that cross sell initiative across the board within our customer base and then lastly our core fee income is stronger than it was a year ago without the benefit in the first quarter of any stock fee income. So pleased we are with that and continue to see progress there, again thatâs being driven by the multiple services that were cross selling into the consumer-customer base that we have.
We had a strong quarter relative to our gain on sale and mortgages, strategic decision I think as many banks did with rates dropping again in January not to the portfolio any 30 year fix rate type of mortgages sell them into the secondary markets which we have been doing. Itâs always been the part of our strategy, itâs one of the lever that we Secondarily, we offer a product to the municipalities which is becoming pretty attractive for them to automatic to do online tax payments if they offer to their constituents have on the balance sheet and one of the lever that we utilized to maintain the assets sensitivity within the balance sheet that we have and make sure that weâre positioned in a very good place for our growth when ROI improved when interest rates rise and then also strong focus on expenses lastly.
We are diligent about expense control on this company as well as taking look at and focusing on initiatives with the process improvement initiatives which are ongoing and weâre starting see kind of benefits of that, we did have about 230,000 I think in non-core expense in the first quarter that should be recurring and overall one thing will happen is that our salary increases will kick in to the full extent in the second quarter. But I think thatâs taken into everybodyâs numbers from weâve been looking at from an expense run rate.
With that Iâll just add if Greg has anything to add from his perspective and then weâll open it up for questions.
Gregory White
Thanks John. Just a couple of things, obviously we were glad to see that our margin remains stable quarter-over-quarter at 283 on a tax equivalent basis. Our yield on loans was actually up a basis point which certainly reflects that our origination rates are very close to portfolio yields which is the case and should continue to be the case of interest rates they arrange by somewhat. John mentioned some of those non-core expenses they were 233,000 they are reflected in our non-GAAP table which is last page of our earnings release and the last thing Iâll mention if you are looking at length quarter just keep in mind we had 338,000 of [swap free] income in the fourth quarter of the last year when we had not any in the first quarter of this year. So when you are looking at kind of a run rate in link quarter take that into account.
John Patrick
And just is related to swap being come all, just mentioning itâs not a reflection of us taking any type of risk on the balance sheet. Itâs just that there is a couple of transactions with loss that closed in the first quarter that will close in the second quarter. So that will be just something that it was just timing. So that we donât deal that we havenât taken any balance sheet risk with lot of term fixed rate loans from that perspective.
So all in all consistent quarter for us. We are used to generating this type of loan and deposit growth. We have our generating positive operating leverage at this point in time. But despite the fact that weâre in a very challenging interest rate environment we continue to move the company forward based on the strategy that we have, we will as we indicated this year be opening some additional branch offices to supplement the lenders that we hired in Western Massachusetts. We anticipate that weâll see a decent deposit growth in those offices from all indication that we and what we looked at in the market right now. So weâre encouraged with where we are and where we are going. Obviously if we had a little bit of help from an interest rate perspective that will be good for all of us.
But I donât see that happening. So even Iâve asked my team this morning and the officers of the company this morning to dig in a little bit deeper, we got to keep climbing the mountain to move over the top and operate in this challenging environment. But again we believe our strategy strong and weâre going to continue to look forward with it. So at this point in time Iâll open it up for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Travis Lan of KBW. Please go ahead.
Travis Lan
If you guys just put some color around the spring field team and what theyâve done in terms of loan production so far?
John Patrick
Yes, I think we are very pleased to who they are, I donât have this specific numbers in front of me right now, Travis. But letâs if I to say they are in target for what we anticipated, they have been doing the first year and the other encouraging thing that I see from there is that weâre opening up deposit accounts in that market place from a commercial and cash management perspective without any branches in the market. So the loan origination has been good and their pipeline is very strong and despite the fact the branches arenât there yet or gathering deposits. So I donât have the exact numbers. But I can try to get you that a little a bit better.
Travis Lan
Got you and the municipal deposit [indiscernible] could you give us a numbers around that and then how the seasonality impacts the second quarter and the last year you guys did a pretty good job of growing deposits in the second quarter. The balance from any run off. But just some kind of numbers around the municipal deposit impact in the quarter.
John Patrick
Yes, I think again weâve had good growth there, there is some seasonality to it relative to especially in January thatâs when in Connecticut, municipal taxes are do. The interesting thing is that we continue to expand that business Travis and diversify with the towns and that we do business within the state of Connecticut. But I think more importantly there is a number of RRPs that has been out there, that have historically been with them a larger bank and weâre seeing a change in some of the municipalities more winning core business and so it is not just reflection of the same business customers that are municipalities that have or taking more deposits with itâs an expansion of the core deposits base on those municipalities as well as increase cash management opportunities with those municipality and as they migrate over and out of their existing relationships. Those deposits will build over time and it isnât a matter they close one day with one bank and open with us the next day. 
Secondarily, we offer a product to the municipalities which is becoming pretty attractive for them to automatic to do online tax payments if they offer to their constituents and so we are seeing in increase with that and we are seeing a little bit of that in our fee income, not to where we a concentration or significant yet but weâre the investment in that technology in that effort is paying for itself and generating a little of income beyond that now. And keep in mind, somebodyâs town and municipalities are less sophisticated than some of the larger cities that other banks may deal with. So, they donât have any historic, may not have had the technology available to allow their people who live in those towns to pay their revenue [indiscernible]. So itâs very encouraging where thatâs going. 
Travis Lan
Okay. And then just within the few lines as well, it sounds like you guys expect swap these to kind of rebound in the second quarter. 
John Patrick
Yes, definitely. I think that as long as that we will continue to see strong pipelines, we know that there is some couple of deals that we are looking at to close in the near term that have swaps with them weâre not looking to take down any balance sheet risk and at the same time weâre not reinsured at this company weâre not selling swaps just for the sake of selling swaps on to this borrows which had then strategy in the past that some of the other banks ahead larger banks that using our market place which frankly weâre able to take advantage of. So, I think itâs just a timing perspective that weâll see that revenue come back in the second quarter. 
Travis Lan
Thank you. Last one for me John, its just kind of big picture view if you could about the profitability potential for the bank how you think you can kind of make progress and improve whether if you are aware of the ROE, just kind of with no support and no kind of near term support maybe from the industry environment just where youâre thinking get the bank that timeline to maybe get there and what the waiver that you can pull will be. Thanks. 
John Patrick
Yes. I think that we need to obviously without any type of interest rate increase we need to make sure that weâre really focused on reducing on expenses and in that going forward. Iâm not going to go on the respective, there is a lot of opportunity out there by loan pool and do different other things and I just donât see that as prudent at this point in time and Iâm not going to give up all we worked really hard for from asset sensitivity perspective right now to have temporary top in earnings and say, hey look it where we did far away for our quarter and then have a come back down. I think that obviously we want to get ROE up closer one end, we want to make sure that we get â close to double digit ROE. I really think that this going to take a little of time but I think weâre well positioned to get there [indiscernible] and I think that our focus again its nothing exciting growing in our contiguous market, growing organically, continuing to build that C&I business which from our perspective is quite predominantly variable rates comes with deposits, comes with cash management services things like that and as you can see we has an increase there in the first quarter and really focused on that going forward. 
Greg, I donât know if you want to add from a timing perspective I think, we donât necessarily give forward guidance but its something that we are focused on and I was hoping that we get there closer to getting there later this year but with the interesting environment that we are in today I donât necessarily see that â I donât see that happening I would love to say that weâd be there second, third â maybe third quarter next year or something like that but weâre definitely focused on it. 
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac of FIG Partners. Please go ahead. 
Christopher Marinac
Thanks. Good morning guys. John and Greg, I was just curious that you can elaborate a little bit on the loan loss provision and I guess the excess that we saw this quarter about the charge offs. Is that indicative of how you may sort of look at providing for growth as about you expand. 
John Patrick
Chris, I lost a little bit of that with the question, could you repeat that for me please. 
Christopher Marinac
Looking at the loan loss provision, relative to charge-offs and the extra amount, can we relate that to loan growth and is that sort of level that we saw this quarter indicative of how the [indiscernible]. 
John Patrick
Yes. Chris, those charge-offs I think it was 3.43 about 70% of that 2 residential loans that we took into RRO so I would almost call that a little bit of abrasion for us or kind of a bad quarter if you will. So, certainly the provisioning reflected kind of replenishing the reserves to some extend and then you just kind of look at our reserves to loans being in the a little sub 90 basis points you can kind of almost use that as a estimated plus benign charge-offs that weâve had historically put in provisioning expanse. 
Gregory White
I also think the reserve reflect the loan growth but also the asset quality that weâre generating relative to the new loan growth, its not seasoned yet but the quality continues to â Iâm really impressed with the quality that Mike and his team are able to generate as we grow C&I book and also the tree book as the matrix surrounding those are very, very strong. 
John Patrick
And so, Chris, when I say the estimate Iâm talking about publically weâve stated we expected low loans, 250 million, you can roughly use the 90 basis points type of number plus the charge or historical charge-offs to provision extend. 
Christopher Marinac
Okay, great. And then with the positive change in deposit this quarter and drop in the loan deposit ratio. Will you expect that to revert back up that all or will it going stay here or more lower. 
John Patrick
I donât expect into revert backup, I think it will stay here and weâre focused on bring it down lower. If I would say that there is three issues relative to us to where we try today obviously its ROA, ROE and loans to deposit. But last, Iâm not this concerned about I think thatâs more of regulatory trigger than anything else we planned in liquidity, obviously we can go out and get deposits very easily, we touch the market place in fourth quarter of last year, there is a cost to that however, Iâm comfortable operating in that environment but we are focused on bringing it down. 
Gregory White
And Chris, I would just add we do see that, the longer deposit is an a huge operational risk for us, itâs more regulatory risk with that said as John mentioned weâre going to manage that ratio down to extend we could, if weâre not successful in doing that operationally we donât see it as a big constrain. 
John Patrick
And again thatâs one of the reasons too we talk about the 250 million in loan growth and 170 million to 175 million, 180 million in deposit growth on an annualized basis. 
Christopher Marinac
Great. Okay. And I guess last question just it has to do with the if the [indiscernible] policy would ship this year continues, does that have any benefit to your margin outlook or profit outlook or is again take bigger rates to really impact there. 
John Patrick
No, weâre very positive for us, 25% basis point shift, any minor shift in rates is very, very positive for us. 
Christopher Marinac
Okay. Just want to clarify that. 
John Patrick
You know, it is what it is and we talk about this all the time. I think good companies figure out how to do business in this environment and weâre seating back waiting for that to happen. We think again it goes back to the strategy that we have, we donât need to do something to risk everything that weâve done already to just have phenomenal results for our quarter or something like that we need to make sure that we sustained long term earnings and that the numbers that we make relative to improvement in ROA and ROE, I donât know even more than one quarter but sustainable in moving the right direction for period of time. That said, those even improved significantly year-over-year but obviously weâre satisfied where they are, they need to move up but it is what it is. 
John Patrick
Roughly, 30% of our balance sheet would â on the asset side would replace pretty much immediately.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time it look like we have no further question. We are going to conclude today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Mr. Daukas, gentlemen.
