Operator
: Good morning, and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems' Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Zabaneh
: Thank you, Yousef, and good morning, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO; Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman; and Mike Lawler, who is the President of our Strategic Markets Group. Mike led the TouchNet acquisition, and TouchNet will become part of his Campus Solutions business.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of our discussions may contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represent management's belief and assumptions concerning future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors. Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning, and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Robert O. Carr
: Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. I would like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland. We have a lot of exciting news to discuss this morning, so our prepared remarks are going to be brief to leave more time for questions.
Before getting to TouchNet, let me provide some perspective on our second quarter results. I believe this quarter marks the beginning of a period of steady improvement in the rate of growth of both card processing, volume and net revenue that are the key to better overall organic growth and more effective leverage of our increasingly efficient operations. This quarter's sequential acceleration in card volume and net revenue growth is being driven by the ongoing strength in the new business generated. This was our first $20 million-plus quarter of new margin installed and our seventh straight quarter of new business growth and an increase of 19% from the second quarter of last year. Both the number and productivity of our relationship managers are on the rise, and we continue to provide them with the innovative new products that are very much on the minds of merchants. Security and mobile solutions are just 2 examples of the many areas where Heartland's innovation is leading the industry.
Beyond card processing, we continue to experience even faster growth in our non-card businesses. Our growth strategy remains one of increasing growth in the core card business, while overlaying that growth with faster growth available in those other segments, in part due to their smaller relative size. The TouchNet acquisition represents an extension of that vision. One that on a pro forma basis brings these segments to almost 1/3 of our net revenue.
TouchNet is an exciting acquisition, the largest in the company's history. The portfolio of integrated commerce solutions for colleges and universities is a perfect complement to our Campus Solutions business. With our existing payment processing product set, Heartland will now be the largest provider of commerce solutions for the higher education market, able to provide an end-to-end experience that is unparalleled in the industry. TouchNet will also increase our overall growth rate, and with their high operating margins, will add meaningfully to our earnings next year. Not only does TouchNet fit ideally with our current operations, but it also fits with our overall view of the many strategic opportunities arising from our core electronic payments capabilities.
As I stated last quarter, we believe there are exciting growth opportunities in industries built around payments, where payments is a major, but not the only part of the business. In recent years, most of our development activities and substantially all of our acquisition efforts have been focused on offering solutions that enhance our clients' business operations, and which have payments integrated into that overall solution. These solutions not only enhance the value we can offer, but also build deeper, stickier client relationships.
TouchNet is a great example of how we are pursuing this integrated commerce opportunity. With their software bringing together all of the different payment flows associated with an institution, they have a proven track record of almost 100% client retention. Adding our payment solutions and other campus products, we not only enhance those relationships, but can also create additional cross-sell opportunities. The combination should drive strong organic revenue growth and high levels of profitability, which make this transaction very attractive.
Let me now introduce Mike Lawler. Mike is President of Heartland Strategic Markets Group, who led our acquisition team and will run TouchNet as part of his Campus Solutions business. Mike?
Michael A. Lawler
: Thanks. Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, TouchNet is an outstanding fit, offering products that complement our core Campus Solutions business while also providing us with further growth opportunities to transition the card volume they process onto the Heartland system. They generate attractive recurring revenue, have a very high customer retention rate and operate a very scalable business in a market that has excellent growth prospects. The business was started right outside Kansas City by Dan Toughey in 1989, and Dan and his entire organization will be joining the Heartland team.
Today, TouchNet works with over 600 schools representing over 6 million college students, which is basically 1 of every 3 students attending a college or university. They provide these schools with an easy-to-use technology that essentially manages the multitude of different payments taking place at the school, whether that be alumni paying for football tickets or collecting tuition from parents and students online.
If you think about a school, whether large or small, payments are taking place in more than just the bursar's office. Traditionally, many of these places such as housing, the alumni center, the athletic department, an on-campus theater, parking facilities, event tickets and even the school bookstore have their own separate payment systems, which eventually had to be consolidated up to the school level. This can be a nightmare to manage for a school's IT and accounting departments.
TouchNet offers a software suite that provides a simple solution that ties all these payments together and empowers school officials with a variety of tools to easily manage all of their commerce activity across the entire Campus. TouchNet offers institutions the industry's broadest spectrum of software, services and strategies for greater control of campus transactions, cost, compliance and constituent satisfaction. Their software solution known as U.Commerce is designed to unify the Campus enterprise, expand as the Campus needs change and deliver integration and innovation. TouchNet will add to our existing portfolio of products for campuses that includes card processing, loan servicing, financial aid refund disbursements and the Campus OneCard System.
Now together with TouchNet, we can offer Campus business offices and end-to-end commerce solution that integrates payment processing and security capabilities of Heartland into the U.Commerce payment system. Universities will be able to process and manage all campus payments using one platform and one service provider. TouchNet will continue to be run by Dan Toughey and will be folded into our Campus Solutions business, where we expect to develop additional synergies and efficiencies that will make this acquisition that much more attractive.
With that, I will turn the call over to Samir. Samir?
Samir Zabaneh
: Thank you, Mike. Let me turn over our attention back to the results for this quarter. For the second quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $17.5 million or $0.48 per share. Adjusted net income for the second quarter was $21 million or $0.58 per share. Compared to $23.1 million or $0.62 per share for the second quarter of last year, both our GAAP and adjusted results in the second quarter of this year reflect our $0.05 proportionate share of losses incurred by Leaf, which became part of Heartland in the third quarter of last year.
In addition, since Leaf losses cannot be included in our consolidated tax returns, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 43.1% compared to 38.5% a year ago. Net revenue grew 6.4% to $159.4 million this quarter compared to the same period last year. Over the same time period, card processing net revenue was up 3.9% and non-card processing net revenue increased by 14.5%. Sequentially, our card processing revenue showed solid improvements, driven by a 5.6% volume increase in the quarter compared to a 3.7% volume increase in the first quarter of this year. The sequential improvement in volume is the result of continued growth in installed margin, a rebound in same-store sales and solid execution and customer retention. We believe this quarter's results mark the beginning of an acceleration and the raise of organic growth in our cards business.
Non-card net revenue accounted for 26% of total net revenue for the quarter. With the addition of TouchNet, we expect total net revenue from non-card processing segments to contribute approximately 1/3 of the total net revenue in 2015.
On a GAAP basis, the operating margin was 18.8% for the quarter. Excluding our share of Leaf's operating losses, the operating margin would have been 20.6% compared to 22.3% GAAP operating margin a year ago. As the result of a prior year merger integration issue at Heartland School Solutions, in which a billing file contained both current and former customers, we recorded onetime adjustments in this year's second quarter that reduced revenue by $1.4 million and increased bad debt expense by $900,000. These adjustments reduced our second quarter operating margin by 140 basis points and our earnings by $0.04 per share.
In the quarter, we utilized $25.8 million to repurchase 652,000 shares at an average cost of $39.55 per share. We have now repurchased $225 million of our stock under board authorization that began in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Cash flow remains strong in the second quarter with management's measure of operating cash flow totaling $32 million and -- $32.8 million and free cash flow generated $19.7 million. Year-to-date, management's measure of operating cash flow was $68.3 million and free cash flow generated $42.3 million. Clearly, we are generating cash at levels that support our -- both our organic and capital deployment objectives.
Capital expenditures in the quarter was $13.1 million and $26 million for the first 6 months. We expect capital expenditures for the year to be in line with last year's level, which was approximately $50 million.
Finally, on Wednesday, we announced an agreement to purchase TouchNet Information Systems for cash consideration of $375 million. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter and will be financed with bank borrowings. Under the terms of the new loan agreement currently being finalized, we will be borrowing approximately $375 million under a floating -- under new floating rate 5-year term loan. Our revolver will remain at $350 million with $200 million outstanding at June 30 and our accordion will remain at $150 million.
Based on current expectations, we believe TouchNet will add more than $60 million of net revenue, contribute over 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. I consequently add at least $0.30 to fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings per share.
TouchNet will be integrated into our Campus Solutions business where its results will hence forth be consolidated. Going forward, we are targeting revenue growth in the mid-teens for TouchNet's business at margins that should improve over time.
Now to wrap up with our guidance. For the full year, we expect to deliver net revenue growth of 8% to 10% and to be between $645 million and $660 million, with growth accelerating in the second half of the year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.33 to $2.37 per share. Guidance assumes after-tax share-based compensation and acquisition-related amortization expenses will reduce earnings per share by $0.41 for the year and the tax rate, above 40% due to the nondeductibility of the company's proportionate share of lease operating losses, which is expected to come in at $0.17 per share in 2014. This guidance does not reflect the acquisition of TouchNet. However, this transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings on an adjusted basis in 2014, including associated transaction costs.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Bob for a few concluding remarks.
Robert O. Carr
: Thank you, Samir. Before closing today's call and opening it up for questions, I'm pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per common share, payable September 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of August 25, 2014. And finally, as always, I would like to thank all of the great Heartland team members who make these powerful results so positive. Yousef, we are now ready to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.
Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
: The TouchNet acquisition sounds really interesting. Let me ask about the core business, the card business, first. Just I guess, I've been hearing -- for Bob Carr, I've been hearing a lot of negative comments or cautious commentary on the legacy ISO model and some slowing growth across some of the public peers. So I'm curious how you see the market and maybe why Heartland's differentiating a little bit here, as a big picture question.
Robert O. Carr
: Sure. I think there's definitely the shift of moving away from the sales model of feet-on-the-street model and going more towards the POS companies and the dealers, working through them, now known as integrated commerce. It's sort of a change in how our competitors address the market. We've always worked with these POS companies. We're working with the dealers now more than ever. So there's definitely a transition going and I think -- now if you look -- step back, Tien-tsin, as you're doing, what is TouchNet? TouchNet is the ultimate POS provider, in a sense, integrating all the POSs in a University. Just like in our K-12 business, it's a POS business where we have control of the transactions. And then that's the direction that we're moving and sort of leap-frogging over to a degree, the dealing -- working with -- competing directly head on with Vantiv and our other -- and Global and our other competitors who are working through the dealers. The salespeople have become the dealers, more so than ever. And I think that's the big change and it's here in full force.
Michael A. Lawler
:
At the same time, if I could just add that if you think about the Heartland sales organization as it exists, there's still a robust amount of business to be done with feet-on-the-street, but the model we've adopt -- employed forever has been one where we have a really focused sales person full-time, who can develop an expertise and sophistication to deal with the increasingly complex processing environment. We think that, that model is just much greatly advantaged compared to having independent contractors out there trying to build business. And then the last piece is that the other thing that we're doing with our sales force is the payroll specialist. Again, that person who can bring a higher level of expertise to the sales process. So a more complex world, one that can be addressed a number of ways and we feel great about the various channels that we have, including augmented by TouchNet this quarter.
Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
: Okay, got it. Just as my follow-up, and I'll jump off, just can you share any stats or do you have any stats handy on the number of integrations that you have with some of the different point-of-sale systems that are out there? And then just on Leaf, how that's tracking? Can you give us any stats on monthly installs or the number of applications offered on the platform? It's really just a scaling question on Leaf. That's all I have.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: Yes. On the integrations, we have somewhere in the order of 2,500, which is a very mushy number because you get different versions of the different POS systems and things like that. But most of our integrations are fundamentally -- to process a transaction for a POS system, you have to be integrated with it. And as the biggest player in restaurants, for example, you can be sure that all the relevant restaurant POS systems are fully integrated into Heartland's solution. So we feel good about that side. It's always continuing to grow as that world continues to develop, but a very robust product set.
Robert O. Carr
:
And as far as Leaf, we are expanding the market of customers who can use Leaf, and we're working on doing that and are confident in our future forecast for Leaf.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
: A couple of things, maybe starting with TouchNet. Like the diversification it provides. Could you provide a little color on your accretion assumptions? The implication is that the profitability of that business is well above the Heartland corporate average. Can you give us a little insight there?
Samir Zabaneh
: Sure. So yes, you are correct. It will be accretive and the operating margin is -- will be higher than average for the company. If you look at it on a full year basis, it will start around the 30%, but it will move up. In terms of accretion, the deal is still yet to close. So all what I want to disclose right now is that it will be slightly accretive for this year. But what we say it will be at least $0.30 on a non-GAAP basis accretive next year.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: And it's important to note that this is a bit -- different kind of business than our existing Campus business. It's really more -- it's a software and SaaS model with the margins that are appropriately higher than in some of those other businesses and than our average. So it's driven by the nature of their business.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
: Okay. It seems like the amount of accretion implies meaningfully the higher margins, but I'm happy to sort of get that offline. I guess, the other question is just when I look at-- NMI growth is very encouraging as their same-store sales and processing volume. The yield blended down a little bit this quarter, could you comment on that little bit, particularly, as a follow-up to Tien-tsin's observations about sort of some of your competitors discussing the growing competitiveness of the market?
Samir Zabaneh
: So when we look at the yield and the core processing business, we look at it by segments of the merchants. And if you look at it over time within every segment, our yield actually has not declined. But we've noticed recently, and that's a trend from last quarter as well, is that we have been getting bigger and bigger and the larger-sized merchants. So there is no -- our actual yield within every category of this size of a merchant remains the same. And it has not really been exposed to that -- to sort of what goes into the market in terms of price declines because we're already competitive. And as I mentioned, just because we're getting into the larger-sized merchants, you see a slight decline in that yield.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
: Okay. So mix, I guess is really...
Robert O. Carr
:
Yes, the smallest merchants. The merchants that do under $100,000, and especially under $50,000 a year, we have less of that business coming in than more of all the other larger sectors. And those are higher margin, just by definition. So we measure by installed margin and I think that's the right way to measure it, but that sort of implies the bigger merchants are going to get a better rate than the smaller merchants. And therefore, our yield is going to suffer overall because of that. But we are making up for it by ever increasing our margin installed, which is a pretty big deal that we've been able to overcome our struggles with that than we had a couple of years ago.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
: Okay. And one more, if I may, just on the competitive front, particularly, as it relates to the ISPs, any change -- I know you've commented in the past that perhaps Mercury was impairing your share growth. How would you sort of frame up your competitive positioning these days?
Robert O. Carr
:
I'd rather be us than them.
Operator
: Next question comes from Mike Grondahl with Piper Jaffray.
Michael J. Grondahl - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
: Yes, guys, can you just say or clarify again what did you say for TouchNet revenues and the growth rate there? Did you say $60 million for 2014 or 2015?
Samir Zabaneh
: For 2015.
Michael J. Grondahl - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
: Okay. And then the growth rate, did I hear that right at about mid-teens?
Samir Zabaneh
: Yes.
Michael J. Grondahl - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
: Okay. And then can you comment a little bit on same-store sales spend? Did you see that sort of across the merchants or was there any categories that stuck out?
Samir Zabaneh
: We saw that across all of the categories. Obviously, compared to the first quarter of last year, you would see improvement across most of the category just because last quarter was an unusually low volume -- sorry, bad quarter in terms of same-store sales. But in terms of the momentum that we have seen, we sort of predicted in the quarter that things will rebound, and we're happy to see that the numbers that we see this quarter. We are always cautious with respect to the same-store sales, so we always monitor, as I mentioned, more than 1% to 2%. But we're happy to see it better, better.
Michael J. Grondahl - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
: Lastly, the billing error cost you $0.04. And it looks like Leaf-associated expenses went up $0.03. And you're absorbing that in your guidance. So how do you want people to think about your new EPS guidance?
Samir Zabaneh
: Good. So our EPS was a range of $2.37 to $2.41. All else being equal, we would -- because of Leaf and because of the onetime HSS matter, we would have declined by $0.07, but we're only revising our guidance by $0.04 because the rest of the business is doing fairly well and better than what we expected. So maybe in other words, I would say -- and so basically, what I would say if we have -- if we did not have a further degradation in Leaf and the onetime nature of HSS, our guidance would have increased. Now let me touch -- so the HSS is only a onetime item and it will be so and so. It's been dealt with and that is translating into our guidance. Leaf is -- I mean, there are further investments in the product and it's going to cost us $0.03 more this year, but we are making up for that through the rest of the business.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
: On the TouchNet deal, a couple of questions. So it seems like a good strategic fit, certainly. Just curious over the last couple of years what their revenues look like. And really, what I'm really trying to get at is to get to a mid-teens kind of growth into the $60 million number are you embedding an acceleration in there with what kind of revenue they've been putting up?
Samir Zabaneh
: No. We are not embedding any acceleration. So basically, the revenue that we have right now is sort of in line with what they have been growing at for the last couple of years.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
: All right, great. And then how did you think about the accretion potential of Leaf? Right now, I think there's more that goes into it than just this, but the accretion versus buying back stock, which seems like it would've been as accretive or more accretive.
Robert O. Carr
:
We look at the investment in mobile POS as a very strategic requirement and -- did you mean TouchNet or Leaf?
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
:
I'm sorry. I meant TouchNet. I'm sorry if I said Leaf.
Robert O. Carr
:
I thought you said Leaf.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
:
He did.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
:
I probably did, sorry about that, Bob.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
:
Again, let me get just throw in -- I think that buying back your stock is always going to be accretive, and we've been an aggressive buyer of our stock for the last few years. At the same time, the long-term growth and strength of the franchise is not delivered strictly by buying back shares and getting into -- more deeply into a very powerful position in a strong vertical at a price. And frankly, compared to buying back stock, it is slightly -- we do expected to be, over time, more accretive. And it also adds the opportunity for higher growth in the company, which will -- we think also benefit shareholders substantially. Getting ourselves back to a double-digit revenue growth, we think is going to be a standout performance in the coming years in the market. We've got to demonstrate that we can do it on an organic basis, but we think that an acquisition like TouchNet is absolutely helpful to move that directionally.
Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
: Okay, I appreciate that. And then lastly, I was just wondering if you could update us on new margin install trends in the month of July.
Robert O. Carr
:
Best month ever.
Operator
: The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
: I was wondering if I can get a little bit more color on the composition of the TouchNet revenue. How much of that business is really split between bill payment, cashiering and some of the other solutions you have?
Robert O. Carr
: Mike, that sounds like a good one for you.
Michael A. Lawler
: Yes, Jim. So the business is primarily the single 2 big growth drivers for the company around their subscription software, their ASP revenues, as well as their transaction services, their payment revenues. Following that, then it's around their some of their maintenance and hosting revenues and some of their onetime revenues. But over half of the revenues are coming from the subscription and the transaction service revenues.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
:
Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, could you give us any more update on Leaf's dilutive impact and whether you expect that to be accretive -- when you expect that might be accretive sometime in the '15? Or do we have to look at beyond that?
Robert O. Carr
:
We're -- by the end of '15, we're expecting to it to be breakeven and accretive in 2016.
Operator
: Your next question comes from Steven Kwok with KBW.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
: Just first question is just around how should we think about the operating margin expansion potential, I mean, post the acquisition? I know you mentioned the 150 basis points of benefit from the TouchNet acquisition. But beyond that, after we think about Leaf being breakeven, what's the operating margin potential beyond that?
Samir Zabaneh
: So the nature of this business, there's a strong operating leverage and you will continue to see margin expansion over the years. We're sort of, right now, we have a lot of investments in products that are strategic and will be incremental for us in the future. We do have, if you look at our margins this year, if it wasn't for the HSS and the Leaf, we would have had slight -- we would have had maybe a slight margin expansion compared to last year, but let's call it level. But on a go-forward basis, we should be expecting margin to be expanding. And I believe if you look at it on a 5-year basis and hopefully sooner, we do expect to be in the 25% range. But certainly, the nature of the business and what we expect coming over the next couple of years, you should be expecting margin expansion.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
:
Got it. Got it. And then just drilling a little bit more on the -- around the TouchNet acquisition, how should we think about in terms of the 5-year term loan? What rates should we assume? And then around -- what are some of the add backs, adjustments that we need to take into account to get to that $0.30 of accretion?
Samir Zabaneh
: So the $0.30 accretion, so in terms of the actual loan that, I mean, the -- obviously, that hasn't closed yet, we should expect around the 3%. And in terms of -- since the deal hasn't really closed we don't really have all of the transaction expenses and the allocation of the purchase price, so I can't really discuss right now all of the details behind that, but I would just focus on the $0.30 for now and give you more details when we're ready.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
:
Got it. And then just if I could sneak one last one in. In terms of Mercury being acquired by Vantiv. I think the acquisition closed in June. Have you seen any changes around Mercury's competitive nature?
Robert O. Carr
:
I think we should just pass on that question. Sorry about that. We're in litigation.
Operator
: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research.
David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
: I guess my one question would be could you give us any color on the trend in same-store sales into July and sort of maybe over the course of the second quarter as well? Was there kind of a noticeable peak in April or May in terms of recovery?
Samir Zabaneh
: We have -- we do not have, I guess, conclusive detail to give you, but July looks very strong and I think a very important point is what [indiscernible] is that our sales in July is the best month ever. But from a same-store basis, we see a positive trend.
Operator
: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley.
Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
: I was wondering if you can give us your updated thoughts about the regulatory proposal from the Department of Education on student loan disbursement and other campus-related payment services? And the potential impact, if any, on your legacy business, and maybe on TouchNet also?
Robert O. Carr
: Mike, it sounds like...
Michael A. Lawler
: Yes, sure. I'll take that. So the -- I mean, the Department of Ed has formed a rule-making committee. Although they've got a proposal out, it's still undergoing a lot of comment, so it's not final yet. So it's really hard to say what, if any, impact there will be. But at this point, we feel as though our business, it's a very small part of our Campus business, but we believe that the final ruling won't have much impact. But again, not having the final ruling, it's hard to say. TouchNet doesn't do hardly any refund business. What business they do is the ACH, which it will not be impacted at all by the rule-making committee because it's strictly around card disbursement.
Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
: Okay, great. And then maybe I just wanted to follow up, too, on the payroll business. Can you just give us an update in terms of what you guys are seeing on the cross-selling front? What kind of successes or lack of success that you may have had so far over the past year or so since you implemented the new sales director?
Robert H. B. Baldwin
:
Yes, I think that we're pleased with the progress with the payroll installs. We're running at a slightly higher growth rate in this quarter versus last year than in the first quarter. The focus remains the Payroll SPA, the specialist, which is a group north of 50 people that we're going to be looking to aggressively grow. Part of the growth in the sales force in the second half of the year is definitely going to be in the SPA world and -- the Payroll SPA, specifically. And so we feel very good about the prospects there. I'd say that the cross-sell will has been and always will be a portion of that business. But it's fair to say that when we say we're going to have a payroll specialist, that person's job is to install payroll deals, and then refer to a general SRM any card opportunities. And then the card generalist can then install payroll or refer the deal to the Payroll SPA, but we're not living or dying on the cross-sell. We think that the payroll opportunity is a very substantial one, in of its own right, and we can -- we'll go after it aggressively.
Robert O. Carr
:
What is happening, which is a little bit of a surprise to us is that our sales people are referring more accounts over to the SPAs than we were expecting. And so we're getting more payroll sales as a result of it, but it's not necessarily to the same customer that we are doing card processing for. So that's a development that we didn't expect. And it's a good one because we're getting -- as our salespeople are out talking to customers, we're able to get more business, not necessarily so much from the same customer.

: Our next question comes from Matt Lipton with Autonomous Research.
Matthew Lipton - Autonomous Research LLP
: First, for Mike and, I guess, Samir. when I think about you moving from 30% revenues to 50% revenues in these nonpayment businesses, I can see Heartland's P&L just becoming more and more seasonally weighted to the first quarter over time. I mean, can you envision a scenario where 30% of your revenues are in the first quarter, if you hit that 50% mark, just assuming that potentially TouchNet is similar to Campus business you have right now in terms of seasonality?
Samir Zabaneh
: Maybe I'll start with that, Mike. So I'm not sure where the 50% came from. But we said that TouchNet will be 1/3, and I think that's where we are quarterly...
Matthew Lipton - Autonomous Research LLP
:
You said over the next 5 years, you'll have 50% -- potentially 50% of revenue coming from this...
Samir Zabaneh
: No, I was talking about -- I think that question was related to the margins as opposed to the actual margin of that business itself. But in terms of revenue contribution, which I think what your question is related to, with TouchNet, we're still going to be at 1/3 of that revenue. We do expect acceleration growth in the cards business. So we do expect card business to grow, but we expect the non-card businesses to grow faster. But it's -- but I think we are nowhere near the 50%.
Michael A. Lawler
: The other part, I would add, that to the seasonality part of your question, Matt is that currently, our Campus business does have some front-end loading in Q1, primarily revolving around the loan payment business and the loan servicing business and us providing all of the auxiliary tax forms for the colleges and universities, which have to go out in Q1, and thus, the seasonality there. But when you look at Titan's business, is not as seasonal. There's a slight -- there's just a slight seasonality in Q1 and Q3 in terms of being slightly more positive because of the tuition payment dates for the first and second semesters of the school year. But beyond that, it's somewhat spread out evenly.
Samir Zabaneh
: And maybe just one more point, if you look at our overall business, in fact, it's quite spread because one business is strong in Q1, another business is strong in Q3. So you will not find massive seasonalities across the whole business.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
:
A question, I guess, related to what we were -- you were just speaking about in terms of if the TouchNet business is not too terribly seasonal, I mean, when do you think the deal is going to close? I'm going to try to work out a potential impact in '14, sort of when is deal going to close? And then, I guess, at that point, is it sort of conceptually accurate to just sort of straight line prorate it from the date of the deal close through the end of the year to try to work out what a '14 impact might be from the deal.
Samir Zabaneh
: Okay, so we said that the deal will close in the third quarter. Right now, the expectation will be subject to the approval that we need. We're expecting it to be towards the end of August. And I think in terms of your modeling of the actual revenue, drawing a straight line between now and the end is a fair number.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
: Okay. And then it looks like your Network Services transaction growth and volume accelerated nicely in the quarter, any drivers to call out there, any commentary in that business line?
Samir Zabaneh
: No. I think it was a good momentum that we're happy with. I don't have any more color on it.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Tulu Yunus with Nomura Securities.
Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
:
I just wanted to drill down into TouchNet one more -- with one more question on the growth. Can you parse out how much of the mid-teens growth comes from selling additional services within the same campuses vis-a-vis growing your campus count? And then also, just related on that, how you expect your campus count to potentially increase as you sort of join that with the ECSI?
Robert O. Carr
: Mike, that sounds like you.
Michael A. Lawler
: Yes. So the -- certainly, some of the growth is going to come from new campus additions. However, a great deal of the growth is coming from cross-sell within the Titan products -- I mean, on the TouchNet products. So they have a variety of products and they also continue to bring on more and more departments within a campus. So when a TouchNet sale is made to a school, it may initially just -- they may just be initially handling the tuition type payments. However, as the school continues to expand, the service across campus and truly unify, as I mentioned early on in the opening comments, they truly unify all the other departments, the alumni donations, athletic fees, parking, events, et cetera. As they bring those together, that in itself has to -- the effect of increasing the growth as well. So I would actually say that probably over half of the growth is coming from that expansion versus adding new schools. One other thing to add while on that topic is we believe that the TouchNet acquisition will provide a great deal of cross-sell opportunities with our existing client base within Campus. Today, the -- our 2,000 location high rate client base is primarily performing loan servicing, although using some of our other products. And we do see the opportunity, though, to go to that customer base and cross-sell them on the TouchNet products and vice versa, to be able to go to the TouchNet base and sell them our current products. Today, we're estimating there's only a 20% customer overlap between our 2 client bases. And so we think there's a great cross-sell opportunity as well.
Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
: Okay, great. And then just if I could ask about your e-commerce efforts. I know you were tweaking your web-in-a-box capabilities, how satisfied are you with that service? And how is that going in terms of sales into the customer base?
Robert O. Carr
: We're happy with it. It's -- we have more work to do to make the product offering more robust. But it's more robust now than it was, and we're doing better than we have in the past and expect to continue to increase our ability to compete in that market.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
:
Two questions. Bob, I think -- Bob Baldwin, I think you had mentioned sort of a long-term goal of low double-digit organic growth. Did I hear you right on that, first of all?
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: Absolutely.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
:
Okay. And can you just remind us of the kind of how you see the pieces falling together to get there? I assume part of it is card acceleration, part of it is TouchNet. Can you give us just a rough outline of the components of that?
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: Sure. That math is pretty simple. It's just got a little bit better with TouchNet. If 1/3 of our revenues are coming from the nontraditional core card business, and I say it that way because a lot of our School Solutions and other businesses have card transactions as a central part of things, but that traditional RM-driven business is going to be 2/3. The others are going to be 1/3. Those others, we expect to grow in the low to mid-teens in aggregate. Again, the TouchNet acquisition bolsters that ability to achieve that. And then so the question becomes how successful are we at driving higher growth in that core traditional card business, which we think this quarter represents the start of a trend that's going to continue to accelerate as we continue to achieve success in installing higher amounts of new margin. And assuming we can maintain the progress we've had on attrition, that will drive higher single-digit to -- and we'd love to get to double digits. We always set pretty high aspirations, but it's a big portfolio. So getting to higher single-digit growth organically in the card business overlaid with 1/3 of the revenues coming at much higher growth rate, gets you to that double-digit, which we're very focused on organically.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
: Okay. And then the second question is, and I think we talked a little bit about this, but I want make sure I got it right. The difference between or the acceleration sequentially from the roughly 4% to roughly 6% processing growth, it sounds like some of it was attrition, some of it was same-store sales. What else changed materially that's going to drive us and what is giving you sort of the thought that there is a -- that this the first data point of a line that we can then draw up into the right for the next, whatever, several quarters?
Samir Zabaneh
: Yes, and that's a very good question. So yes, we did have the help of the same-store sales. Our efforts on customer retention are excellent and hopefully, they'll continue. But a very important fact is that all of the -- the increases we had in installed margins for the last several quarters have started to come to a fruition right now. Because when we announced like higher installed margins last quarter, we will start getting the benefit of that this quarter. So as we announce more and more higher installed margins, you're going to see that part helping a lot in driving our overall volume and our overall revenue on the card business as well.

: Our next question comes from Paul Condra with BMO.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
:
A couple other questions about TouchNet, is part of the story there potentially expanding the solution to beyond kind of education space in any new markets or verticals or anything?
Robert O. Carr
:
Mike?
Michael A. Lawler
:
Yes, good question, Paul. So we do, with the TouchNet acquisition, have a lot of integrations to various ancillary services like parking and event management. And as you've seen in some of our other press releases, we've been doing a lot of work in those areas outside of education. So we do certainly expect to be able to take some of those integrations that TouchNet have and some of the ones we already have and try to merge them to expand what we're doing in education, but as well as to also expand what we're doing outside education.
Robert O. Carr
:
And I'd just like to add, Mike, for a number of years before finding TouchNet for us, was working very diligently on building out a product set for municipal government to pay taxes. And the combination of parking, most municipalities have parking lots and on-street-parking, we have good solutions there. That's actually one of our primary businesses in terms of percentage of the market. We think we can go on to the municipal government market very strongly with the combination what Mike has done for us in the past plus the TouchNet software integrations to parking. So that's a big plus for us that was unintended consequence.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
:
I guess, my follow-up would be just on if you could talk about acquisitions, in general. So what's your pipeline look like and what the pace that, that you've made this deal pretty substantial?
Robert O. Carr
: Mike?
Michael A. Lawler
: Well, we've certainly have a pipeline of potential opportunities. But at the end of the day, we're looking for the right opportunities that fit within the Heartland product set and the things we're already doing. So we're always cognizant, always out there looking. Certainly the TouchNet acquisition is a large one and it took a lot of effort. And we'll continue to integrate it, but we expect that we'll be looking at others for the foreseeable future.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.
Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
:
My question is also regarding TouchNet. So interesting acquisition, my follow-up is how much of that business is, if any, is on-premise at the university? Do you guys consider it Saas, web-based versus software? Could you just give us a little bit more breakdown on that? I know you gave some color earlier about subscriptions and payment revenues, I appreciate that. But just in terms of where is it physically located, that would be helpful just to begin with, and I have a follow-up.
Michael A. Lawler
: Okay, so Wayne, the overwhelming majority of the business is SaaS and subscription-related today and is actually hosted in TouchNet data centers. However, when TouchNet started out, it wasn't that way. It actually was a software install at the Campus location. And so they still have some of those legacy clients that are still running the on-premise location software. However, all of their new sales and even a lot of those legacy clients are being migrated to the ASP type or SaaS type model.
Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
: And so just so I understand on how this grows, this is going to be more users coming on that are going to increase the subscription rates or more transactions? And can you walk through what some of those transaction fees might be?
Michael A. Lawler
: So -- correct. So the -- so as more users come on, there certainly are more fees. The fee schedule to a university is based on the volume of transactions and the different departments that are brought on to the system. And then, of course, the various products that are selected as well from bill payment to cashiering to marketplace, those types of products. So as the school buys more products, runs more transactions, the fee schedule changes. TouchNet typically enters into a 5-year contract for the subscription service, typically bills on a year in advance based on expected numbers and then also charges for the actual payment transactions themselves.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
: My question is around the -- on the core card processing business. Just trying to piece together some of the earlier comments and questions about the sequential trend. It looks like same-store sales were up 2.6%, volume was up 2% and revenue growth accelerated by 90 basis points or 1% this past quarter. I think you addressed the revenue maybe just a mix issue, but on the volume side, I think you're -- I keep trying to figure out all this installed margin growth, the really impressive numbers you're putting up there doesn't seem to be impacting that volume number as much as I would've thought, but it sounds like from your commentary today, that you're pretty optimistic that's going to continue to ratchet up and potentially get into the higher single digits later this year? And if you could just comment on attrition. I know it ticked down this quarter, but putting those pieces together, it seems like there is a piece missing -- your same-store sales accelerate and create new business volume, but yet not seeing quite the acceleration in volume and revenues.
Samir Zabaneh
: Okay. Chris, just I want to clarify one number you mentioned. I think you mentioned volume growth of 2%. Did I hear you correctly? Volume grew this quarter at 6.5%.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
: I'm looking at the volume -- SME processing volume of 5.6%.
Samir Zabaneh
: Yes, and then over all -- okay, I...
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
: 3.7% last quarter. It went up for sure and I just -- I think given all the new business you've put on, I would think you would outpace your same-store sales improvement.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: Well, Chris, one things that has to be kept in mind, we have a big portfolio. And the new margin installed, growing 20% or 19%, is great and it is a meaningful positive. So -- but it's relevant to the base that you have to look at. And what we've seen and have been talking about is this accumulates over time, and we're seeing the benefits now of the accumulated installed margin rate, so as we -- if and as we maintain north of $20 million install margin, which we did the first time this quarter and we look forward to trying to do in all future quarters, you'll see that accumulative effect. It is a big ship that we're moving with a faster prop and the rate of acceleration is being seen in this quarter.
Samir Zabaneh
: And maybe just one more point. When you look at installed margins, yes, these numbers had been quite, quite impressive. But really, it's a function also of our number of sales people and the productivity they have. We have tripled the productivity over the last 3 years and we are intent on continuing to add to the net number of sales team. So we do expect the installed margin to just continue to grow. Given the size of the market, we don't see right now any limit in sight of what that number is going to be.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
: Okay. And then I have another follow-up on earlier lease commentary. Is the higher operating losses being driven by sort of product sales and success in the -- broaden the distribution of Heartland platform accelerating or decelerating? Because sometimes you can get operating losses if you sell more. I'm just try to get an idea of the trajectory. And then if you'd also comment on where the Leaf product is having the most success? Is it small, mid, large, restaurants, retailers, where is Leaf having success? And how is that contributing into your ability to maybe skip to that processing as well?
Robert O. Carr
:
Right. Leaf is a countertop payment product right now. And we've invested more into the core platform, and that explains the increase in operating loss from what we expected.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: Yes, it's just -- it's really -- I mean, it's not driven by, frankly, success or lack thereof in product sales because it's primarily a development-stage company with a lot of great work being done. So it's really the expense burden that we decided collectively to absorb, to create products that will be meaningful in terms of revenue and sales, not until really, as early as fourth quarter and really into '15 and '16.
Operator
: Our next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
: Just a quick question going back to the margin -- I'm sorry, to the merchant mix and the yield, and the question about revenue. You guys have talked for a while about going upstream with your merchants additions. I'm just curious, can you talk to us a bit about the margin profile, maybe the initial freight phase of boarding larger merchants and then more on the steady states? Clearly, I think we can appreciate the lower yield. I don't know if I fully understand that there's additional service or setup costs that come with that. And obviously, there's a lot more scale and value that you should lever. So I'm just very curious, as we think about the margin story at Heartland, how much of it will be driven by the merchant side and the acceleration there versus maybe how we would have thought about margins to where you were at Heartland years ago when it was much more around the smaller merchants.
Robert O. Carr
:
Yes, it's a great question, Tim. And Bob has done some great research on that recently, and it's just clear that the small -- smallest mom-and-pop merchants, our salespeople aren't targeting them anymore. They're going upstream to the larger merchants. So we have fewer merchants overall, more volume and most importantly, the metric we really focus on is installed margin. Installed margin, of course, it's contribution margin. So we have fewer new merchant contracts coming in of merchants below $100,000, but more contracts coming in for merchants over that. And of course, the margin percentage and basis points is lesser for those, but the dollars is better, and that's what we're focused on.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
: And the other thing to add, when we talk about larger where -- there are 2 kinds of larger. One is really national and regional chains and things like that, where we continue to put efforts and having some decent success. In those, you'd have an installation process that you roll out to stores on a sequential basis. So it's sort of ramps up, that's not really the driver of what we're talking about. We're -- I mean, even our larger merchants, the $5 million and $10 million and $20 million a year merchants, that's where our RMs are -- when they get larger, that's what we're talking about. And those don't have a meaningful setup cost typically or a slow implementation or whatever. So -- but it does have that lower basis points of yield. And as I think I've commented before, one of our key things is -- we have always had a scheduled minimum basis points, and we're running that -- the same schedule today as we did 15 years ago. We don't see any degradation in the fundamental profitability that we can get from a merchant today compared to what we could get 5 or 10 or 15 years ago. And in fact, the work I've done, the basis points that we're realizing -- in the first quarter of 2014, the most recent segment I looked at, the basis points in the -- whatever buck you want to talk about, the 100 to 200 or the 500 to 750, the basis points that -- the actual margin that we're seeing from merchants in the first quarter this year is better than it was 2 years ago, 4 years ago, 6 years ago, almost -- we actually measured 12 categories of volume. And this year's first quarter relative to those prior years, somewhere around 10 out of the 12 categories, are basis points of actual margin realized this year were higher than in this first quarter of 2012 or '10 or '08 or '06 if we're randomly choosing an every 2-year thing. So it is that migration upward in the base. There's no question that there's been price competition introduced in that 100,000 merchant category. And then our salespeople, in order to succeed in their margin installation goals, are moving upmarket to drive their business.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
: So if I could just ask a quick follow-up because I know we're sort of in the bottom of the hour here. But if we had a P&L just on merchants, is -- would it -- is it somewhat fair to say or to think about, like the P&L on merchant would be much more top line-driven at least from the optics in -- versus margin-driven if we think out over the next couple of years? Just given everything you said about price makes sense, but just thinking about the mix and sort of what the relative margins or yield would look like on volumes. We have more of a top line-driven merchant story than a margin-driven one?
Samir Zabaneh
: So I'm not sure I would separate those right now. I mean, we are intent on increasing our top line, but I'm not really sure why does that translate into a different bottom line. As we mentioned, we are going after the larger accounts, but on the smaller accounts, they seem -- they still have the same types of margins. Bob, do you have any?
Robert H. B. Baldwin
:
Yes -- I'd like -- we've got to watch out margin versus margin. When we talk about new margin install, that's a measure of first year profitability than the intrinsic profitability of the business. I think that we continue -- as Samir has commented, this is a business that has intrinsic improvement in operating margins as you scale up. By adding new -- more new merchants, by getting more growth in our business, getting that revenue growth up in -- towards that double-digit revenue growth, we would anticipate driving a little better operating margin from that core business, and that's definitely an objective that we have.
Operator
: Our next and last question comes from Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity Research.
Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division
: I apologize if this has been asked before, but I just wanted to ask a broader question about the direction of the company. As you -- can you talk just a little bit about how you think of the revenue mix, kind of developing over the longer term? I mean, it used to be that the company was -- very primarily driven by card processing, smaller merchants. And to be sure, card processing is still, obviously, very, very important. You've had all these other business lines that have grown quite nicely. You're making another acquisition in the education space, as you discussed thoroughly. So can you help me think a little bit about how this company is likely to look at more on a steady-state over the longer term? I mean, the split between card processing and the other revenue lines, that sort of thing?
Robert O. Carr
: Well, let me say, we look for acquisitions in the card-related businesses, but with the pure -- the core business, if you will, haven't found much that's been attractive to us. We think we're a great manufacturer of portfolio. So our strategy there, still looking, still open to new solutions, but the strategy there is really going to be organic growth. And given the size of that business, it's a lot of work to get to move the needle on that, and we're achieving some good success. Therefore, what we've been doing in the acquisition world has been acquiring things that can grow a little bit faster, in some part because of the relatively small size they're in, but also in better protected markets. And I think the other theme that we emphasized here is that the integrated solutions side that a company like TouchNet represents is a great way to drive not only a consistent revenue growth, but also better retention. And if there's one thing that you'd have to say is not so fun part of the core card business is you lose merchants every day and some of them to going out of business, and some of them to competitive factors. That when you get into a business like TouchNet where their retention rate has been just fantastic, it's -- you're embedded into a company or into a school, in that case, getting those kind of embedded solutions is a very positive thing. And it's something that if you look at our overall portfolio, we've been adding to that embedded nature of our business in the last number of years.
