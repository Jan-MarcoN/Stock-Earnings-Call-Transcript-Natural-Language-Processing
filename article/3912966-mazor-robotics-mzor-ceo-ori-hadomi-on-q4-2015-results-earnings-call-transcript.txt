Greetings and welcome to the Mazor Robotics Incorporated 2015 Fourth Quarter Financial Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Polyviou. Please begin, sir.
Michael Polyviou
Thank you, operator. We also want to thank everyone for joining us today for the Mazor Robotics conference call and Webcast to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2015. On the call today are Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer, and Sharon Levita, Chief Financial Officer.

Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael, and welcome to Mazor's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 conference call to discuss our record operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the results, and then we will review the market environment and provide an update on our growth strategy as we seek to expand our leadership in the robotic spine and brain surgery market.
As we previously announced on January 6, we received order for 12 Renaissance systems in the fourth quarter of 2015, the highest number of systems order we generated in any single quarter in Mazor's history. For the full-year, 25 systems were ordered by customers, a 25% increase compared to 20 systems in 2014. During 2015, we also sold an upgrade to a German hospital. On the global basis, we ended the fourth quarter with 108 systems installed, and 64 of these are in the United States. This compared with 83 globally and 46 in the US at the end of 2014.
Our performance in the fourth quarter is really a reflection of our overall penetration strategy as we install systems at leading academic centers, enter new U.S. metropolitan area markets, expanded in existing markets, and grew internationally. On the utilization side, we continue to see further growth by surgeons, demonstrating they continue to be highly satisfied with the system and recognize its contribution to patient care.
We reported revenues of $8.8 million in the fourth quarter, a 54% increase compared to the year ago fourth quarter. Recurring revenues continue to demonstrate strong growth in the quarter as it increased to $3.5 million, which represents a 40% rise compared with the year ago fourth quarter.
To provide some more detail on our fourth quarter performance, we installed eight systems in the U.S. and advanced into new metropolitan areas, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, and Birmingham. We also expanded our presence in Central Florida and in Texas, the two states with the highest concentration of Renaissance systems, reaffirming our clustering model.
On top of these achievements, we also gained three additional leading academic institutions as customers, including the University of Chicago, University of Miami, and University of Connecticut John Dempsey Hospital located in Farmington, Connecticut. Penetrating the large Northeast market has been a goal of ours for some time. And our success in the fourth quarter and second half of the year is a significant achievement.
We had two systems in the Northeast entering 2015, both in Upstate New York. Today, we have a total of six Renaissance systems in the Northeast. We are building greater awareness, and it's creating incremental system sales opportunities for Mazor. Internationally, we received purchase orders for our Renaissance systems in the fourth quarter. Two were in China. One was in Taiwan, as Asia continues to be fastest growing market outside of the United States. A third system was in Russia, which now has seven systems.
As our results demonstrate, we ended 2015 strong and enter 2016 with momentum. Our sales team is actively engaged in several high level commercial discussions in both United States and the international market. As a result of pursuing these targets, to date in 2016 first quarter, we received order for two additional Renaissance systems, one from Australia, and one in Louisiana, increasing our total in the US to 65 systems.
To highlight the level of surgeon satisfaction, we have had approximately 15,000 procedures performed with our systems to date. Approximately half of the cases utilizing the Renaissance system are minimally invasive procedures including multilevel cases. The number of MIS cases performed with Renaissance continued to exceed the broader market share of figures for MIS cases, which are estimated to be in the range of 12% to 13% of instrumented spine cases, mainly single-level cases and rarely include more than two levels.
These results continue to illustrate that the Renaissance is indeed an enabling technology for MIS spine surgery, regardless of the complexity. Dr. Sweeney, an orthopedic surgeon from Sarasota, Florida, was doing 50% of his cases MIS. And since utilizing the Renaissance, he has migrated to 100% MIS. He is performing more complex cases and has experienced an increase in his practice.
A paper which was published online prior to being in print in the journal Spine last month reported the results of a meta-analysis of the published literature on MIS versus open posterior spinal fusion. It concludes that MIS is economically superior, and it could help drive surgeons and hospital administration to pursue MIS spinal fusion and fix technologies that enable performance of MIS fusion in a safe and efficient manner. The report does not mention Renaissance, but if you haven't seen it, please let us know and we'll be happy to provide you with a link to this article.
Interest in Renaissance remains high, and our pipeline at the end of the year was at record level. We know from experience that a high majority of surgeons that try the systems in our Bioskills Lab become advocates for purchasing our products with their hospital administration. However, because of the variety of participants in the hospital decision to purchase a Renaissance, engaging with the hospital C-suite earlier in the sales process is enabling us to qualify the pipeline, which reinforces our belief that we will demonstrate year-over-year growth in system sales. Our results this year demonstrate that our engagement and strategy is generating improved results.
We have previously reported our focus on penetrating major U.S. metropolitan areas, where the vast majority of the addressable market of about 400,000 annual procedures is performed. In addition, the procedure volume in major metropolitan areas are home to most academic institutions and teaching hospitals. In 2015, this approach led us to make success in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Charlotte and the Northern Virginia market, meaning we have systems in 26 of the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Our success in these markets reflects the high-caliber capital sales reps we have recruited over the past 12 to 18 months.
In Asia, our fastest-growing market outside of the United States, we continue to experience a high level of interest in the Renaissance system. Our distributor partner in Taiwan and China each ordered systems in the fourth quarter and our partner in Australia ordered one already in this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the fourth quarter, I want to provide an update on our growth strategy.
First, we continued to increase our market footprint. We ended the fourth quarter with 15 sales reps. One of our key hires during the year was Chad Zaring, a VP of U.S. Sales. He came to Mazor with successful track record and extensive experience in the robotic surgery market and his impact at Mazor was immediate. In addition to opening new channels with national accounts, he has been instrumental in several system sales, including in the fourth quarter.
Our goal in 2015 was to penetrate three academic centers. And we surpassed this by getting into five, which includes the three I mentioned earlier as well as two we sold in the fourth quarter to Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey and the other to Columbia University Hospital, a leading academic center in New York City. Internationally, during 2015, we received orders for seven systems and one upgrade.
We continue to work with our distribution partners to penetrate new hospitals. Second, we are focusing on an increasing utilization of the systems in use. For the year ended December 31st, 2015, systems in place for more than 40 months averaged 80 procedures compared to 72 procedures in the year ended December 31st, 2014. This is the result of having the qualified and hardworking team of clinical sales reps working with surgeons who share our vision of leading through innovation and benefiting from the value of our technology.
They know the patients are benefiting from the shorter stay and reduced risk. But, in today's healthcare environment, it's also about better outcomes and there are numerous published reports highlighting the performance and accuracy of Renaissance systems. Third on our list of priorities is to deliver product enhancements and product innovations regularly to maintain high level of surgeon satisfaction. In October, we introduced our clinical solution product strategy with the PRO solutions, which included solutions for spinal deformity surgery, trauma, and lateral procedures.
The significant investment in innovation and the launch of the PRO solutions line will enable us to build on our leadership position in the robotic spine and brain surgery market. Finally, we continue to engage in clinical studies and data collection. As you all know, there have been several studies on the accuracy of Renaissance as well as its ability to reduce exposure of intraoperative radiation and enhance surgical efficiency. However, there have only been sporadic reports on patient outcomes, which in today's outcome based healthcare environment is critical and a game changer for technologies that produce favorable patient outcome.
I'm pleased to say that the results of a new study should be reported very soon. Although I'm not at liberty to discuss the findings of the study with you at this time, a surgeon investigator involved shared the data with us. And there are significant reductions in complications and revisions when using Renaissance compared to current standard of care, which may result in a significant cost savings for the hospital.
The data has been submitted to the leading conferences. And we expect to know within the next three months whether it was accepted for presentation and if it's submitted for publication. We will be sure to report on this development as soon as we are able to. While this development is exciting, it doesn't come as a surprise to any of us, given the success of the Renaissance in the 15,000 cases performed. We are investing extensively in research exactly because we are so confident on the superior clinical value that our system delivers to patients, surgeons, and hospitals.
The advantage of having this independent data published will be that the number can be fit into a simple ROI model which I believe will be very attractive to hospital executives. This type of clinical evidence as well as the wide range of previously published and presented data about the Renaissance system provide our team with a clear and distinct competitive advantage when talking to surgeons and administrators about the advantages of Renaissance.
Our customers as well as our private customers are increasingly recognizing that our clinical data is unsurpassed and will remain so for the foreseeable future. During our third quarter conference call in October, I was optimistic, and I had confidence that we would exceed the number of systems ordered in the second half compared to the first half. Our team executed, and our confidence was rewarded as we sold 15 compared to 10 Renaissance systems in the first half.
Our performance for the full-year reaffirmed our view that Mazor performance should be measured on an annual basis rather than on a quarterly basis. Our momentum leads us to believe that 2016 will be another growth year for our company. As I mentioned earlier, we have closed two system sales already in the first few weeks of 2016 first quarter. At the same time, we do believe that, once again 2016 will be a year during which our second half system order will exceed the first year.
Now, to review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon.
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori, and hello, everyone. I will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue for the three months ended December 31st, 2015, was $8.8 million, an increase of 54% compared to $5.7 million in the year ago fourth quarter. Geographically, revenue in the US was $6.7 million, or 76% of total revenue, with $2.1 million, or 24% of revenue, from international markets.
Capital sales revenue was $5.3 million in the fourth quarter, a 66% increase compared to $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, as we received orders for 12 systems compared to six systems in the 2014 fourth quarter. Revenue from disposable kit sales grew to $2.2 million, a 69% increase compared to $1.3 million in the last year's fourth quarter, reflecting the increasing utilization primarily in the U.S. market as well as increase in our installed base.
Revenues generated from service and others were $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million in the year ago quarter. Gross margin remained high at 78%, relatively flat compared to the year ago fourth quarter. Operating expenses were $9.8 million compared to $8 million in the year ago fourth quarter. And the increase in expense is primarily due to our continued investments in sales, marketing as we recruit more sales and clinical reps, and invest in activities to raise our brand awareness, broaden our sales footprint.
We continue to invest in R&D to support increased product offerings, which includes the PRO solution line we introduced in Q4 during the NASS Annual Meeting. This as well as other development projects would allow us to build our leadership position. On GAAP basis, the net loss for the fourth quarter was $2.9 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.09 per share, in the 2014 fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter in 2014.
Cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter was $4.3 million compared to $1.9 million in the last year's fourth quarter. The increase in cash used for operating activity is mainly attributed to the increase in trade receivables, the increase sales in the fourth quarter. As of December 31, 2015 cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $40 million, which provides ample resource to execute our business plans.
That concludes my remarks. And now, I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary comments, and then we'll take questions. Ori.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. In summary, we successfully executed against our growth plan and had a strong finish to a record year. We grew system installation by 25% and continued to improve system utilization. We also entered new metropolitan markets, including New York City and Chicago, two of the largest cities in the United States and penetrated five academic centers. We also continued to build a large barrier of entry in terms of peer-reviewed clinical data on the performance and benefits of the Renaissance system.
We were the first to market with a robotic device for spine surgery. And we are the only company with clinical cases approximately 15,000 procedures performed to date, which further enhances our strong reputation in the market. Our success in generating excitement and market increased awareness for Renaissance positions Mazor to accelerate the adoption and make Renaissance the standard of care. Our growth plan is demonstrating tangible results. And I expect we will continue to broaden our presence this year in the United States and globally. I believe 2016 will be another good year. And I'm confident we will again strong growth in system sales and utilization.
Thank you, again, for joining the call. Operator, we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tracy Marshbanks with First Analysis. Please proceed with your question.
Tracy Marshbanks
You mentioned the size of your US sales team. Could you remind us how that breaks down capital to clinical? And more importantly, where do you think you should be or would like to be by the end of this year?
Ori Hadomi
Okay. The first questions are structure and the numbers. Structure, you know we have two main teams. One team is the capital sales team members and Sharon in a minute will share the exact number. And we have another team the clinical sales reps, the clinical sales reps support the cases and are responsible for the recurrent revenues and utilization of the system, and the capital sales team responsible to sell new systems. Sharon, can you share the rep numbers?
Sharon Levita
Sure. So at the end of 2015, we had 16 capital sales reps and approximately 45 clinical sales reps and the plan for 2016 is, in the first half, to stay more or less with the same amount of people and slight increase in capital sales team during the second half. With respect to clinical sales team, we typically grow this as we sell more systems. So there will be continuous growth in the clinical sales force.
Ori Hadomi
And, Tracy, I just want to add one more thing. This is probably one of the first years that we begin the year with our capital team all experience in place. We don't need to hire new team members and wait until they all have experience. So that's really a new thing for us. Everyone is in place with a new VP and very energized.
Tracy Marshbanks
Yes, always better to start with a team that knows the game then has to the rules to start, right? So, I agree.
Another quick question, you mentioned your utilization of 80 for systems that had been in place for over a year. To me, itâs always a little bit daunting to try to figure out where that might go because you have - some procedures are very complex, multilevel. So you are actually doing very complex and sometimes relatively rare procedures. And then at other facilities, it's very high volume. Where do you think that number could trend to? And what are your key drivers, say, in 2016 more docs, more procedures, or more systems sort of graduating to that level that you've recently placed?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, it's a very good question. And I think that the closer you look at the numbers, you see a lot of different things because, at the end of the day, the number 80 represents an average. But if you look deeper into it, there is a group of service that's using the system for between 120 to 200 cases a year.
There is a group that say, are between 50 to 120 and there's a group use it for less than 50. Obviously, our effort is to increase the utilization and we are focusing in 2015, we put a lot of focus on these accounts that had relatively low utilization and training the people there and working with the team for similar technology. In some of the places, we learned that it probably wasn't necessary the right touch. And there is so much we can expect and this made us actually put more effort in the average and in the higher utilization side.
I think that, to your question whether the growth will come from more surgeons or higher utilization per surgeon, I think we would focus - we are going to focus on both of them. We have a team dedicated to each site. And the role is, number one, to train more surgeons and make them use it and also introduce a solution to and to introduce the ability to use the system in different applications and different procedures so the utilization per surgeon will increase. So I think that these two areas will be an area of focus to us.
Tracy Marshbanks
Do you have availability of information not on procedures, but on I'll call it levels done per system?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, of course. We have a lot of information. We have a lot of information about what type procedures, how many levels, and of course, yes.
Tracy Marshbanks
Okay. So you can actually capture some of the complexity issues.
Ori Hadomi
Absolutely. We know exactly what type of case, every day each of the systems is used, and we have a lot of information that the system collects.
Tracy Marshbanks
Okay. Last question, obviously, you did a great job of getting some academic centers onboard. Obviously, you have your own clinical trials and independent trials. But, typically when you're in some of the academic centers, data and information starts flowing out from those investigators overtime. When do you think that might, there might be some accumulated cohorts or investigator studies that start coming out even if they're small from your recent installs?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, so, we expect I think that sometime around end of May, early June, we expect to be able to share some information. We are basically waiting. As I mentioned earlier, we are waiting to hear back on different conferences and from different research, from them, certain investigators about the acceptance of all the abstracts that they submitted. We can't disclose information before they're accepted. But, we expect that sometime late in May, early June, they will get all the updates from the conference and the journals. And then we'll be able to share the information.
Tracy Marshbanks
Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks much.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Cohen
All right. Can you hear me okay?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, I hear you okay. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning. So, did you say where the two units thus far were placed for 2016 in the first quarter?
Ori Hadomi
One is in United States and another one in Australia.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. Got it. And could you talk a little bit about utilization and number of kids? Sharon went through the numbers, I guess 2.2 for kids and 1.3 for others. So, can we assume that two fourths I'll call it 1,300ish procedures?
Ori Hadomi
Sharon, can you relate?
Sharon Levita
Yes, more or less, yes.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. Got it. And could you talk about the new product introductions, specifically for lateral? Have you begun to place some of these products thus far? And is there any user experience that we've garnered thus far?
Ori Hadomi
We are collecting information. We are we did several I think close to 50 or 60 cases. And they are still not in a full release. It will be released in full at during the second quarter. So, we'll have more data then.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. And one more if I can. Ori, you spoke about the some procedures or a number of placements. You talked about the first half that you would anticipate first half 2016 being greater than first half 2015, which was 10 systems. And then you made some comments about the expectations of exceeding on the second half. Could you just review that for us?
Ori Hadomi
I think the general message was that we expect to have a year with significant growth. And it will be both at the year level as well as half year level. That was the message that I expect the first half will be stronger than first half of last year as well as the second half.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. And, Sharon, did I miss the U.S. revenue composition versus the outside U.S. revenue composition for the fourth quarter? Could you repeat that, please?
Sharon Levita
For the fourth quarter, it's 5.3 U.S. and 3.5 international.
Jeffrey Cohen
5.3 US, 3.5 international. Okay. And that.
Sharon Levita
Yes, I'm sorry. It's 6.7, and then the remaining is the international, 2.2.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. And then for the full-year 2015, approximately how did those numbers look, U.S. and o-U.S.?
Sharon Levita
For the U.S., it is a bit over $20 million.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay. So 70 plus percent. Got it. Okay. That does it for me. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew Taylor
Hi, can you hear me okay?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, we hear you great. Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Taylor
Good morning. How are you? I just wanted a little more granularity on the growth comps area. I think, obviously people expect you to grow. Can you talk about how you think that growth is compared to consensus or any guidance on how high the growth could be in 2016 relative to 2015?
Ori Hadomi
As you know, we don't release guidelines for exact numbers. On the last three years, we shared a very qualified standard projection about the growth, but we didn't give numbers and we will not change from this policy for this year. What I can say is that there is sufficient I think supporting indicators that tells me that it will be a very good year for Mazor. As I said earlier, we have all the capital team in place.
We have a new VP that brought a real new energy and new approach to the Company. We have the support of five really important academic centers that are very engaged and using the system and talking about the system in a lot of conferences. And I think that, generally speaking, the word is in the streets. People are talking about the clinical results. It helps us a lot to open doors. So, without being specific about the amount of doors, I expect that 2016 will be probably the best year for us. I expect it to be a record year for us.
Matthew Taylor
Okay. And I was curious about your commentary about the halves. How much visibility do you have into the second half? And why do you feel like you're able to be able to say now that the second half is going to be already better than it was last year?
Ori Hadomi
In December 29, but with the dates, but in our business, there are so many steps until a deal is closed. And as you know, many of our deals are closed at the very end of the quarter. I think that the way for us to deserve the confidence and to have a better awareness, better certainty about the realization, the plan, is based on the pipeline and the level of engagement of the hospital administrators. So, bearing in mind the sales cycle takes something around nine to 10 months, I think that, sometime around the mid of the year, I will have a good visibility about second half of the year.
Matthew Taylor
Okay. And just one final one. Any color on when we might hear about pipeline product next-generation systems, or you talked a little bit in the past about adding potentially the surgical tools or other razor blades that you might sell into the procedure?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, as we shared in NASS, so as to increasing our clinical products, we will definitely introduce during 2016 several new procedures and solutions and add-ons to the current product. As to the next generation, as I said also in the past, we are very active and working on this and once we will be ready, we will share with the market and we would prefer not to talk about it before it's ready.
Matthew Taylor
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Matson
So, I guess I just wanted to start with one of your competitors MedTech, their ROSA robot I guess just got approved in the U.S. for spinal use. And so, I understand it's obviously a huge market and very underpenetrated and so, having another player out there is not necessarily going to come at your expenses. But, one, I was wondering if you've seen any kind of bakeoffs where hospitals will bring in both systems and compare them. If not, is that something you expect to start happening? And then how would you kind of sell your Renaissance system against their ROSA system? I guess it sounds like you're kind of leaning on some of your clinical data. But, is there anything else that you would point to, to try to differentiate your product?
Ori Hadomi
Sure. Thank you for the questions. So, I think we should count not only the ROSA by MedTech, but also I think that the market expects that sometime during 2016 or maybe early 2017, Globus will come with the Xcelsius. So, I think we should expect that, in the coming, let's say, 24 months, there will be at least two robots in the market. We expected this many years ago. in 2012, we already assumed that, by 2017, there will be two players. And we have a very solid plan in place how to deal, how to position, what kind of technologies will differentiate us from the other players.
As you mentioned, the market is huge. But, still, I think that users will compare. I think that the main impact will be on the sales cycle because some hospitals will want to compare between the two different technologies and it may impact the sales cycle. Still, I think that given the clinical experience, the data, and the results as of today, I don't expect the impact to be significant during the coming 24 months, and that's my answer right now.
Q - Mike Matson
All right. That's helpful. And then the procedural growth was obviously pretty good from the 72 per system to 80 procedures per system. How much of that was driven by just more volume out of existing users versus more surgeons adopting the robot in the places that have them? And I guess, more specifically do you are you able to track the average number of surgeons per system that are using it? And what's the trend been?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, we can we are tracking the number of surgeons using the system. And we're tracking the average. We have sites where we have six or eight different surgeons who are using the system. And that was taken into Hackensack is one of these. And then there's one in North Carolina, a few with six or eight surgeons. And we have sites where there is one or two surgeons using the system.
I think that I don't have in front of me the analysis of what contributed more. I believe it's a combination of both of them. We definitely did this year a great job in training more surgeons per site to use the system. And we also, as I mentioned earlier, focused some effort in retraining and coaching surgeons where the utilization was low and introducing to them the benefits in other type of cases and helping them to use the system in these type of cases.
Michael Matson
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the can you just remind us on the international installed base? I think its 44 systems. How many of those are at distributors versus being used clinically?
Ori Hadomi
The numbers Sharon can share with you. But the very, very vast majority we have only a few systems probably that have been purchased for demonstration or something like that. But, without having the data in front of me, I think that more than 90% of the systems are in clinical sites.
Michael Matson
Okay.
Sharon Levita
Right. As you mentioned, 44 systems are in the international market. And the vast majority of them are in clinical use. Here and there, there are a few demos, but it's not the majority.
Michael Matson
Okay. All right. That's all I have. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Craig Bijou with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Bijou
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Ori, I wanted to start with your comment on the pipeline. You said that your, the pipeline this year currently stands at a record level. And I was hoping to get your thoughts. Do you have an overall is your overall level of confidence of conversion higher than, say where you were at this time last year? And is your do you feel you have better any better visibility compared to this time last year as well?
Ori Hadomi
Hi, Craig. Good morning. Yes, the answer is that I think we learned how to evaluate and how to qualify the lead so that our probability assessment will be more reliable. So, the answer to your question is yes. I think we have a better certainty today. And when I'm looking at the pipeline, I have a better more certainty about the chance to convert the pipeline to deals.
Craig Bijou
Okay. Thanks. And then for Sharon, I guess, just wanted to get I know you guys don't provide guidance, but just wanted to get some high level thoughts on what the P&L will look like in 2016, gross margin, operating margin. I know you increased spending in the second half of 2015. So do you expect that to continue, or how should we think about the spending relative to 2015?
Sharon Levita
In general, the area where spending will grow is in the sales and marketing mainly, where we are continuing to invest both in just awareness, trade shows, and marketing activities, as well as increasing the number of people, especially of the clinical sales team. So, you will continue to see growth on that side. And the R&D I think will be more or less as this year. We do expect an additional increase for next year on the sales and marketing especially.
Craig Bijou
And just on gross margin, do you guys do you think you can stay in the upper 70s?
Sharon Levita
I think so, in the mid 70s to a little bit higher. We can stay there.
Craig Bijou
Okay. And just if I could squeeze one more in, you guys haven't talked about the opportunity in Japan recently. So, I just wanted to get timing there and what the expectation is for approval there.
Ori Hadomi
I don't expect it to happen during 2016. The process does take much longer than what we expected. And I would be very surprised, given the process there, that we'll be able to conclude it during 2016.
Craig Bijou
Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, everyone. Thanks for your questions and for your time. And we're looking forward to report the next quarter again. Thank you. Bye, everyone.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.
