Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 Covidien plc Earnings Conference Call. My name is Clinton, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for replay purposes also.
During today's call, Covidien may make some forward-looking statements, and it's possible that actual results could differ materially from their current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements contained in Covidien's SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and 10-Q reports for additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.
The company may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in Covidien's press release and its related financial tables, as well as in the Investor Relations section of covidien.com.
I'd now like to hand the call over to Cole Lannum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks, Clinton, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Joe Almeida, Covidien's Chairman, President and CEO; and Chuck Dockendorff, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll be making some brief introductory comments and then spend most of the time this morning answering your questions.
I will remind you that today's call will focus on our third quarter results. We will not be updating our 2013 guidance today, consistent with past practice. We'll be initiating our 2014 guidance at our Investor Day next month on September 12.
For the third quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.85. After adjusting for certain specified items, our non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.91 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe, who will go into more detail of the third quarter results. Joe?
Jose E. Almeida
Thanks, Cole. And let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our third quarter results. We delivered a solid quarter. Sales were on plan, up 5% operationally, and up 3% as reported. In a number of large categories, including stapling, energy and monitoring, we continue to grow ahead of the market, benefiting from new products and investments we've made.
At the end of the quarter, we successfully spun off the Pharmaceuticals business as an independent company, Mallinckrodt. We strongly believe that Mallinckrodt has the products, management team and the capabilities to deliver value to shareholders for years to come. Their results are excluded from our reporting today, as they are now shown in discontinued operations.
In the Medical Devices segment, we had a very good quarter, with 6% operational growth with increases across the segment. For our emerging markets business, comprising Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia and Latin America, we had another excellent quarter with operational sales growth in the mid-teens and double-digit increases in most product lines.
As we mentioned on our last call, we faced difficult comparisons in emerging markets this quarter due to customer order timing in last year's third quarter, so these results are all the more impressive. The performance was paced by continued strength in the BRIC countries. These results reflect investments we've made in the last couple of years to expand sales and marketing and to build an on-the-ground presence. We still see excellent opportunities in emerging markets and we'll be ramping up our investments to capture these opportunities.
Let me now turn to our third quarter performance in individual product categories. As in the past, I will discuss our growth on an operational basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In our large Endomechanical business, stapling products had another excellent quarterly performance led by the innovative Tri-Staple reloads. We continue to grow above the market and gain incremental share in stapling. We did have a couple of one-time benefits this quarter including competitive recall and some positive customer order timing.
In Soft Tissue Repair, we registered double-digit growth in synthetic mesh, reflecting new products and investments we've made here over the last few quarters. This growth was offset by lower sales of sutures, and as expected, in biological mesh.
Our Energy business turned in another solid performance with 10% growth, led by a double-digit gain from vessel sealing for the 31st consecutive quarter. New products including Sonicision and LigaSure Small Jaw contributed to the quarterly improvement. Our pipeline of new products in Energy continues to be robust, with the recent launches of the next-generation LigaSure Impact implant tip.
Turning to Vascular. We again delivered double-digit growth in chronic venous insufficiency products. As we noted last quarter, we faced difficult comps in neurovascular on both Solitaire and Pipeline, but remain comfortable with the overall growth of the portfolio. In peripheral vascular, our year-ago results were bolstered by a competitive stent recall, which restrained our growth this quarter. In compression and dialysis, which accounts for about 1/3 of our Vascular business, sales were below a year ago, primarily due to unexpected impact from distributor order patterns in the U.S.
We're addressing the challenges in our businesses and still consider Vascular to be a key growth engine for the company. We do expect the sales growth rate in the third quarter to be the low point, and growth should be somewhat better sequentially beginning next quarter. Longer term, we continue to expect our Vascular business to grow in the mid-single-digit range or better.
In Oximetry & Monitoring products, sales were significantly above a year ago, aided by the Oridion acquisition and continued increases for pulse oximetry sensors. We're very pleased with the Oridion's performance thus far, and we are getting significant penetration in the U.S. Airway & Ventilation sales were well above last year with broad-based growth across the category.
Turning to the Medical Supplies. Sales in Nursing Care were above a year ago, reflecting strong growth for enteral feeding products, as we are benefiting from excellent execution following a competitor withdrawing from the market. We did see some unexpected negative impact from distributor buying patterns within the quarter, offsetting the excellent performance in enteral feeding.
Overall, we are very pleased with our results this quarter. As noted, growth in vas was well below normal. We faced some very difficult sales comparisons and foreign exchange continues to be a drag on our results. That said, we continue to deliver above-market performance in stapling and Energy and register a double-digit increase in our respiratory business and made incremental investments to expand our capabilities. We expect emerging markets opportunities. Robust new product pipeline and a strong cash flow will allow us to deliver a positive performance in the fourth quarter and 2014.
I will now pass the call over to Chuck, who will discuss the third quarter financials in more detail. Chuck?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter as sales met our expectations. Unfavorable foreign exchange lowered the third quarter sales growth rate by about 200 basis points, and our 2012 acquisitions added about 100 basis points. As noted in the release, we registered a 100 basis point decline in adjusted gross margin this quarter, as unfavorable foreign exchange and pricing more than offset positive mix and productivity gains.
Reported SG&A spending was above a year ago, reflecting the medical device tax and the investments we are making in emerging markets, partially countered by productivity improvements and leverage on our back office costs and base business SG&A. The investments we've made over the last couple of years have driven organic revenue increases, and as Joe mentioned, we are committed to making investments in both R&D and SG&A to accelerate our growth going forward. We'll be discussing this in more detail at our September Investor Day meeting.
On an adjusted basis, our third quarter operating margin was 21.5% of sales. Year-to-date, the adjusted margin of 22.5% is consistent with our previously communicated guidance range.
Net interest expense was about even with a year ago. Note that the quarter only included about 6 weeks of interest expense from the debt refinancing we recently undertook. So that net interest expense should be somewhat higher beginning next quarter.
The adjusted tax rate was better than expected, as we're able to accelerate some of our tax-planning activities, which offset some of the tax dyssynergies from the spin. On an EPS basis, this benefit was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.
During the quarter, we repurchased about $625 million of stock, accelerating our activity to utilize excess cash. In the last 12 months, we've returned more than $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
As you know, we have traditionally not updated guidance on our third quarter calls, and today is no exception. However, I would like to provide some qualitative comments on our expectations for the fourth quarter in relation to the results we've just reported for the third quarter.
As we noted, foreign exchange was unfavorable to our sales growth rate by about 200 basis points in the third quarter. And at current rates, we will be negative by close to 300 basis points in the fourth quarter. This will, of course, put pressure both on our reported revenues and gross margins. In combination, the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and the implementation of the U.S. medical device tax are expected to cost us about 9 percentage points of EPS growth in fiscal 2013.
We will continue our plan to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive our future growth. And as noted, we see a number of opportunities for investment spending to enhance our growth in 2014 and beyond, and we'll prudently fund those growth-driving investments. We expect to balance these investments for future growth of the business while delivering shorter-term earnings growth. We continue to feel very good about our prospects. We'll provide full guidance for fiscal 2014 at our September 12 Investor Day meeting.
I'll now turn the call back to Cole for Q&A. Cole?
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks, Chuck. [Operator Instructions] Clinton, can you once again please review the process for signaling a question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Joe, as a starting point, we saw a pretty nice reacceleration from where you were last quarter in some of the core franchises we saw. Medical Devices, in total, reaccelerate back to 6% organic growth. And that was really Endomechanical picking up, Energy picking up. And so the third quarter looked a lot like your first quarter with the exception of the comp in Vascular. Can you just talk about how you're feeling about the health of those core franchises? And how we should think about this quarter and the pickup this quarter versus concerns everybody had a quarter ago?
Jose E. Almeida
We feel that our core franchises are well positioned, driven primarily by commercial execution. Second, very healthy pipeline of products. Taking, for example, Energy, we just launched 2 new products there and continue to renew our efforts in becoming a total energy player for our customers. I would say that endomechanical, primarily endostapling stapling, we have growth well into the double digits, in the teens. That tells us a couple of things. One is we continue to take market share in the U.S. and Europe. Second, we're doing an extraordinary job in emerging markets by continuing to penetrate MIS procedures versus open. We're very happy with our execution on some of our acquisitions. We spoke about the Oridion, but also Newport ventilator has been a blockbuster success in emerging markets. Oridion has done a great job for Covidien. It's on a run rate of about $100 million in sales per year, so we're quite happy there. And we expected our Vascular business to perform as such, as we have warned our investors that this was going to be a tough comp quarter. But going forward, we see the underlining strength of that business, primarily with 12 new products launching in 2014.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Joe, let me just follow up on that last point there. So we see the Vascular business this quarter and our tough comps after neurovascular and peripherals, and a lot of the questions, I think, that people have been raising inter-quarter, at least to us, have been what drives the reacceleration in that business. Last couple of years was about pipeline in Solitaire and the strength particularly in neurovascular. As you look at that franchise broadly, going into '14, what does drive that reacceleration? Or what should we focus on?
Jose E. Almeida
First of all, the -- let's start with the compression business. That business will anniversary -- just anniversary some of the changes that were -- that happened in term of contracts in the marketplace. And Covidien is entering the home care market for compression. And we expect, in 2014, to have some good momentum there. We have the right product lines and we have the right sales force to do it. Then when it comes to neurovascular, if you remove the impact of the Solitaire and the pipeline, you have a business growing mid-single digits to high single -- actually, high single digits, so growing above our competitors in market. And we have a significant opportunity in peripheral -- in the peripheral business to really work within the new boundaries of health care with -- using capitation and the extent and size of our bag to really advance our products into privately-owned labs. So we have an experiment going on. And I think Covidien will be successful in creating a brand that works with the labs in terms of capitation and have the products available for those locations in a way that nobody can do. Meaning, we have more SKUs available to our customers than most companies. So I feel comfortable that this is a franchise that will deliver mid-single-digits or high mid-single digits in the future, and we'll grow above market. Just look at the folks who released earnings in the last 2 or 3 weeks and check the growth in their Vascular business. So I feel comfortable that we have the fundamentals in that business and the people, more importantly, that will make this happen.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.
Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
It's Bob Hopkins. So I'd like to switch to operating margins and operating expenses, generally. So a specific question and then more of a general question. On the specific side, now that we're post the Mallinckrodt spin, obviously, your overhead expenses are still roughly $400 million, now that you're a $10 billion business and they were $400 million when you're a $12 billion business. So I was wondering if you could comment on the potential for incremental restructuring as we look forward to offset some of that relatively higher expense base. That's the specific question. And then the general question is just you guys haven't had much operating leverage in the last couple of years for several reasons that people are well aware of. Just wondering if you could comment. As we move into 2014, can we return to a period of more normalized operating margin expansion? Or is that going to be another year of heavy investment for you and the lack of operating margin expansion?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, Bob, this is Chuck. I can handle the restructuring one. We've spent a significant amount of time on the spin on Pharmaceuticals and we think it's gone really well, and the people did a great job in putting that together. And I think part of that is reflected, I think, in the tax rate you see in the quarter, they were able to manage through that, as well as go through a very complicated spin transaction. Having said that, we're very well aware of the -- what we call corporate costs of $400 million. That $400 million is -- also includes some support that we have for the businesses in terms of IS and software and things like that. But we are -- we do have some leave-behind costs, as a result of Pharma that we allocated to them. We are looking at our overhead, both on corporate and G&A, around the regions in our country -- in our company. And we will be initiating programs to take that down. We're going to talk more about that on Investor Day. But we will be looking at that, as well as looking at our manufacturing footprint and some of the optimization we can go there. We feel very comfortable about future opportunities to reduce these expenses going forward. We've challenged our corporate groups to go through and to take that -- their expenses down in relation to the pharma spin. It isn't like you can eliminate -- you lose 20% of your revenue, you can't go in and do it dollar-for-dollar, because there are just some fixed expenses. We don't eliminate 20% of our board and things like that. But the thing is that I think at the end, we see opportunities for restructuring and expense reduction that far exceed the amount of business that we lost with the pharma spin and any leave-behind cost that we have there. As far as -- and again, we'll cover more on that on Investor Day and where we see these opportunities specifically and where we see -- we think we can drive further expense reduction in the company. The other part as far as operating margin improvements, I think that the 2 things -- and I mentioned this in my remarks, we've had about a 9% headwind on our EPS growth just from FX and the device tax in the current year. I think a lot of the margin -- limited margin expansion we've seen is that part of this has been the investments. But we are driving productivity through in a number of areas on the SG&A and manufacturing, which is being offset with the foreign exchange and the device tax. And so while you're seeing these headwinds come through like this, we're seeing, generally, going forward. And, again, I don't want to get any specifics in here, we'll update this on Investor Day, but, certainly, in our gross margin line, FX is a big deterrent on that side of it. And it's also impacting that down to the operating margin line, as well. So I think there will be some margin expansion as we move forward, both on some of these restructuring programs we have, the productivity we drive through. The big unknown is what happens with foreign exchange rates and things like that, that we just can't control.
Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. And then, I guess, I'll follow-up on that just a little bit. And so just to be a bit more specific, not to pin you down to a number, because I know we'll get those in the future, but can there be net -- sort of net normalized operating margin expansion for your business next year when you consider all the things that you just mentioned?
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think, Bob, rather than get into that specific piece. I think, what we tried to always articulate, because we do have a lot of investment opportunities. We have more than we can fund. And so what we try to do is to drive through off of the sales growth rate that we think we can achieve, a double-digit EPS increase, both through operational and financial leverage. This year, when you look at it on reported numbers, we're not able to do that, because of the big hit from foreign exchange. But if you look underlying, you're seeing double-digit operating improvement in the company year-over-year. So we're able to continue to invest and drive double-digit operating income improvement, net of FX. I think going forward, Joe and I talked about it, we want to continue to invest, because these areas are really good. They have good returns. And we think they're the right kind of moves to make. We also understand that we need to drive the short-term growth as well, and we'll be focused on that in 2014.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Just quickly, Chuck, can you say roughly how much the foreign exchange hit the gross margin, like 50 basis points, 100 basis points? I know it's been a pretty wide spread in the past.
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think it was heavier this quarter. We don't really get into the detail around that. I would tell you though in the gross margin, again, the trends we're seeing in gross margin are such that the favorable mix is more than offsetting the unfavorable price that we see, and we would expect that to continue going into the future. The one thing that really hit us negative this quarter was the foreign exchange that will most likely continue into next quarter based on where rates are today. The one other item we've had in gross margin is an increase in some of our supplies costs in our Supplies segment, primarily around cotton and resins that we can't pass on to our customers. So we had a little uptick there related to supplies. But other than that, if FX is neutral, we would expect to see in the productivity that will drive through, we would expect to see improvements in our gross margin based upon the mix and price that we see going forward.
Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. And then quick one for Joe. I know it's not a big line item. But synthetic mesh, you've really turned that around. Can you say what's changed? And is that growth emerging market? Or do you think you're taking share in the U.S.?
Jose E. Almeida
Matt, that is primarily driven by reaccelerating the investment in the portfolio. We also have better commercial execution in emerging markets, as well, so it's all of the above. And one thing that also we have benefit is the launches in fixation, which we've turned the corner, and we can see growth there, whereas some of our competitors, we're seeing negative growth there. So we feel very comfortable with our franchise. And just adding the biologic mesh is -- it is what it is. We elected to have a smaller product line, more narrow and doesn't have the investment perhaps that you would have in the other ones. Not that we're not making any, but we're making a much higher investment in fixation and synthetic.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Joe, I was wondering if you could just maybe expand a little bit, or Chuck, really, on the investment spendings and just in terms of what buckets they're in. Is it mainly -- are you thinking more down the lines of emerging markets? Is it going to be more increasing the amount of R&D that you're spending? Or should we also just think about this as from acquisitions, as well, maybe increasing the pace of some technology tuck-ins?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Kristen, we have 7, what we call, strategic bets that the company is making. Above and beyond maintaining R&D for all businesses at Covidien, a proportion to their potential creation of intrinsic value. Those 7 initiatives, one of them is emerging market, so heavily investing in emerging markets. We're now shifting from Asia into Latin America. The team feels very confident that health care is still high priority for governments in Latin America, and we cannot miss the opportunity to be there. So if you look in our outlook of investment, emerging markets has the highest proportion of spending. Then we'll continue to invest in neurovascular -- very committed to neurovascular. Then drug-coated balloon is another investment of Covidien. The advancement of the -- our stapling and endostapling franchise is another area. So we have very focused investments that will probably -- those 7 initiatives will account for about 70% or 80% of our future investments. So they're very laser focused, and they have a potential -- a great potential for creation of intrinsic value the next 3 to 5 years.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, perfect. And then just, I guess, Chuck, any thoughts on perhaps initiating any sort of better hedging programs to kind of smooth out the impact on currency. Some other companies have most recently talked about establishing some hedging programs. Just kind of wondering what your thoughts are, or maybe just looking to move some manufacturing locally to put in place better natural hedges.
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes. I think, Kristen, we've had a hedging program in place. We hedged on transactional inventory movements, 100% on the future 6 months and 50% on the following 6 months. We've been consistent with that. It's just we've debated it, we've gone through it, we think maybe we can drive some efficiencies by driving internal bank within Covidien. But right now, I think so much of our manufacturing footprint is in the U.S, we do get an impact from that going forward. Part of our restructuring program that I talked about was certainly to move some of our manufacturing to low-cost country sourcing and manufacturing, and that will take time. But I think that footprint will move that way over time. But just right now, we're all living with it, we make a lot of money and profits outside the U.S. and in Japan and emerging markets. We're very profitable in these areas. And it does impact us when we have a change in the currency just from the translation piece of it. And we've never hedged the translation income on these outside sources or outside entities that we have.
Coleman N. Lannum
Kristen, and I'll remind you, too, that it is that consistency that we've had by not changing the policy, really, since well before we were even a public company. We've kept it the same -- the entire time. We think, actually, gives a little bit more expectation and more clarity as to what's going to happen as opposed to moving things around. And, obviously, I don't have to remind you of this, the reality is hedging only -- any hedging program only postpones the inevitable. At the end of the day, there is no such thing as a hedge that takes care of the problem in perpetuity. It only delays any reality that may change from foreign exchange.

The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
It's Miroslava. Let me start with a question on Oximetry. You have done a good job with acquisitions in recent years. And based on your competitor's results yesterday, it seems like the market is quite healthy. I'm just kind of wondering, how do you think about your competitive position, and, frankly, the growth profile of this business now that you are annualizing the Oridion acquisition?
Jose E. Almeida
This is a great business for Covidien. I just want to pick up on the first point you made. Our team in Boulder -- our respiratory business in Boulder, has done a phenomenal job in integrating acquisitions and creating a significant amount of value in every acquisition that they've done. Bob White manages that franchise and that team has done the integration, all the way to bringing in Oridion to $100 million mark and going forward, going healthy into the double digits. We believe that Covidien has the new products and the franchises to grow at or slightly above market as a category. We feel comfortable with market growth rates for these businesses being around mid-single digits, perhaps a little slower -- a little lower than that. But we have launched a significant amount of new products. We're excited in integrating our respiration rate into OEMs in the next 6 months. So I feel comfortable. And I think I spoke to all of you last September at Investor Day that this business has more potential than the street thought of. And I think we're showing this year that despite having acquisitions in our numbers, the execution has been excellent.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Right. Clearly, that's the case. And maybe a quick follow-up on what you're seeing in inpatient volume trends and procedure trends in your businesses. There have been -- some of -- some companies have commented on continued weakness in elective procedures and perhaps even an increasing trend towards conservative treatment. Is there anything you are seeing in your business that it has deviated from trend?
Jose E. Almeida
I would say that, that's where I think there's some good news. We have not seen utilization significantly down. It oscillates between specialties and types of procedures. We see some pickup in bariatrics and other areas, so -- thoracic. So there are some -- the positive sign for us is that the utilization is not going down. It's pretty stable. Now doesn't mean that this is a factor that is long lasting. We can't predict the future. But as far as we can speak today, we feel comfortable with the utilization being at this point and Covidien having the flow of new products and excellent commercial execution that we can deliver on our commitment to be slightly above market in our growth rates.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Joe, I wanted to pick up on a comment you made earlier in the call in response to the Mike's questions about Energy devices. You talked a little bit about having the broader set of SKUs and Energy and being able to be a full solution provider to your customer. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit more broadly and the extent to what you're seeing either benefits from contracting across your entire portfolio. And any benefit or demand from your customer you're seeing to sort of go to a one-stop shopping model.
Jose E. Almeida
David, what we see is you've got to know -- you've got to own a specialty, you've got to own a procedure, you've got to own modality to be able to be relevant in the future. We have extraordinary competitors in this area. But I have to underscore the fact that Covidien has worked very diligently in the last 6 to 7 years in creating a very robust portfolio. They're having the ability to go to an institution and talk about energy in general. And I think we can be the partner to those institutions, as they were showing by a 13%, 14% growth in vessel sealing that we still -- we're strong across the globe in creating value to our providers -- the providers who we're partner with. And adding to it, we have a significant amount of pipeline coming up. We are not thinking about the next generation of generators. We are on -- the other day, I was in Boulder. And we're seeing the second-generation way ahead of the one that has not even launched yet. So our commitment to investment in R&D for Energy, in general -- and that goes from what you see today and we report on the vessel sealing, all the way to Barrett's esophagus, all the way to the devices for ablation, all the way for hypertension. Covidien's an energy company, and it will use its know-how and leadership in this area to really become a #1 player in Energy.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. And maybe a follow up for Chuck. I just want to make sure I understood your comments regarding the P&L in the fourth quarter, and in particular, the point you made on interest expense. I think you said that you only incurred 50% of the interest expense associated with the debt refinancing around Mallinckrodt. Can you just remind us what the fully burdened annual interest expense there should be? And then on the tax rate, is the year-to-date tax rate the right number to use on a sustainable basis?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, I think the tax rate -- I think, you want to look at the year-to-date rate as the one that will -- we estimate for the full year. Yes, that's correct. As far as the interest -- we refinanced a $500 million note with the $750 million note. Longer term, we went out 10 years, and it has higher interest rate, but we thought the markets were good at the time. And so that higher interest was in the quarter for about 6 weeks, I think. And so that'll be reflected in the full quarter for next year. That's the increase in interest rate. There's no new debt from Mallinckrodt on our books.
Coleman N. Lannum
If you do the math. And you can do it, but it's a lot of pieces. I help you do it. Net interest expense on a quarterly run rate basis, assuming a full quarter of the additional interest burden load, should be in the $52 million to $54 million range, somewhere in that ballpark. And that's what I'll be using quarterly, starting in the fourth quarter and going forward, assuming no change in short-term interest rates on the interest income side of things.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Maybe 2 quick questions. First for, Joe, in this quarter, as we've seen in the last couple of quarters, the gap between U.S. growth and emerging market growth continues to widen. I think based on our math, the U.S. growth rates have declined now 4 straight quarters. And you mentioned utilization. Utilization is not materially under pressure. But I wonder if you could talk about, in your U.S. business, as this sits -- is it broad macro in the U.S. relative to emerging markets? Is it a situation where it's specific product lines in the U.S.? Or is it simply a product gap that will be addressed in the U.S. or new product innovation, which should accelerate that growth rate versus the last few quarters? And I have a quick follow-up.
Jose E. Almeida
Okay, so let's dissect this a little deeper. We have comps issues this quarter, primarily in Vascular. So that would -- was primarily in the U.S., the growth that we saw last year due to the stent recall and the Solitaire. The big boost in Solitaire was a U.S. launch, because Solitaire was already available in Europe. So this is the first factor. The second factor is supplies, due to some change in ordering pattern from a distributor, had an impact this quarter. And supplies is 90-plus percent U.S. So having those 2 factors is what has affected the growth rate in the U.S. Now to expand to the macro view of it, the growth rates in the U.S., we'll never get close to what we have in emerging markets. And I think we can put a decade there and it will probably not get close. So there's a significant difference in penetration of technology and health care in the U.S. that I believe, and the changes in the U.S. health care, that will make that growth rate in the U.S. to be in the low single digits for the long term. What we saw that I thought was a positive sign was not a change in utilization to the worse. So I hope that clarified your question.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes. I think, your alloc for the U.S. market I think, is very, very clear. And then Chuck, one of the 2 big debates post the spin seemed to be investment spend, which Bob touched on, and then secondarily capital deployment. And, I guess, there seems to be a view that you've improved your balanced approach to capital deployment over the last couple of years. And there seems to be a view that Covidien is very focused on emerging growth assets. And we hear confusing things that Covidien's very focused on emerging growth assets, but we also hear that emerging growth assets are being priced further growth. But we're also seeing other companies simply engaged in accretive transactions, using cash, using their powerful distribution in credit to drive accretion. And we don't hear Covidien ever talk about simply deals to leverage distribution and drive accretion. I wonder is that because it's not possible or just not a focus for management? Or is that perhaps a misperception by the investor base?
Charles J. Dockendorff
No, I think we do that on -- as you see we do product tuck ins and, I think, Oridion's a good one of that and where we can leverage our existing distribution base around the world. Those are very good transactions, and we performed very well on those. Those are hard to find, but when we do we see some definite levers there. As far as emerging markets, we have a very quick turnaround in payment on these investments that we make. It's probably -- salespeople pay for themselves within the year. And right now we're investing a little bit more around the training facilities around the world. We feel that while we can go through and add salespeople and drive revenue, part of the benefit of our products is as we train physicians on these products, they stay with them, and it continues to grow. And those physicians train other physicians as well. So we're making some pretty big investments in not just distribution and sales, but also training institutions. We have them in China. We're putting them in Latin America. We put one over in Eastern Europe. So these are areas that we think are good investments for the long term. But I would tell you that on the emerging markets side, the business is very profitable. It's not deteriorating in operating margin. And most of our SG&A investment is going into that area.
Coleman N. Lannum
And David, let me remind you as well, you made a comment on OUS cash for other companies, obviously, that's not a constraint on us, because we don't have the same repatriation issue as some other companies do. That's not an issue, one way or the other for us.
Jose E. Almeida
I just want to underscore the fact that Covidien is open to synergistic deals. Chuck has mentioned the Oridion was very synergistic. We could not have accelerated the sales to what it is today without having their product in the bag of our sales reps and having SG&A synergies. It was not much on our radar screen a couple of years ago. And today, we think differently, because we believe that ownership of a specialty or procedure is important for the company. So we are looking, and we continue to look, and we have opportunities in front of us on synergistic deals. But we never will abandon the natural rigor that we deploy in looking at deals. Being synergistic alone doesn't mean that our shareholders, at the end of the day, would have an improvement in their ROIC or will have an improvement in the intrinsic value of Covidien that will drive value to our shareholders. So we put that on the scale as heavy as ever, making sure that we're making the right investments to our shareholders.

The next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies Group.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Joe, can you provide an update on definitive AR after enrollment earlier this year, and maybe an update on milestones as we look out? And how much of a driver do you envision drug-coated balloons can be for Vascular? And I have a follow-up for Chuck.
Jose E. Almeida
Yes. The definitive AR for the 12 months enrollment is complete -- was completed in April. And we will not comment on anything else regarding the -- we're not allowed to comment on the results. But in terms of enrollment, we're in good shape. The 12 months result is complete. You're talking about the atherectomy, which is the definitive AR. In terms of -- drug-coated balloon is a key technology for our peripheral vascular. We will not be #1 in the marketplace, and we know that. But I believe that Covidien has a remarkable offering in the marketplace from total occlusion to different sizes and different applications of stents and guide wires and balloons, accessories. So the ability -- in atherectomy as well -- so the ability to bring a balloon to the party, even if we're not #1, will be extremely beneficial to the company. And I think a lot of the future growth of peripheral vascular is based on the replacement of stents for drug-coated balloons. So that is a technology that we invested a significant amount of money. I think, Kristen from Deutsche Bank had asked the same -- had asked the question about Vascular. And I said the drug-coated balloon is one of our key strategic bets. And there's a lot of money being put into that as a percentage of total investment for the company. So we're very optimistic and very happy with that.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Great. And for Chuck, housekeeping one, if I missed it. What is the share repurchase authorization outstanding as of the end of the quarter? And then may be a quick update on the Tyco tax liability dispute. Is there any timing on that? And is the company allocating reserves for the latest development in that case?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, as far as the share repurchase authorization, we have after the third quarter, $2.8 billion left on the $3 billion authorization that we got approved this year, so plenty of room there as we move forward on that capital allocation piece of it. As far as the Tyco tax situation, you saw an increase in some of our reserves as a result of that. We are fully reserved for all of this. We expect to make some payments next year, probably, in a couple of hundred million dollar range. It's a potential. These things are hard to time. And when we do it in all of that. But we feel that whole situation is very well under control. We feel good about it. It's something that will play out over the next 3 to 4 years, I think, as far as the final settlements and payments and things like that. But in total, everything on our balance sheet will be coming out in the Q. We have, I think, about close to $1.7 billion of accrual on our balance sheet related to all these liabilities, all the tax liabilities, when you take tax-sharing piece of it, as well as what our specific liabilities are, above 500 of these are related to post-spin -- the balances to pre-spin, so we feel adequately reserved on all of these issues.

The next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with Barclays.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division
I just wanted to ask one on Energy and one on endo. On Energy, I was hoping you could give us some, at least, qualitative color on the Sonicision launch, and help us understand how much that's contributing? And what else is driving the growth there?
Jose E. Almeida
Okay. The Sonicision launch has been phenomenal. On a worldwide basis, it's doing well, but -- very well, actually, in the U.S. And we have the ability to do good contracting. And as I said before, Covidien's an energy company. So our team in the U.S., led by Chris Barry, is doing a superb job in getting this project, well entrenched in marketplace. And a great deal of our success is Sonicision, but also the continued launch of new products.
Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Okay, great. And then on Endomechanical you had in a nice growth rate this quarter. Can you talk about, I guess, you have maybe a little bit of an easier comp from the duet recall last year, and then maybe some contribution from superD. Can you talk about those relative to the performance of the stapling launch and the underlying business?
Jose E. Almeida
SuperD is doing extraordinarily well. But that's not enough to move the needle on such a large category, okay? There was a competitor recall, if I'm not mistaken, endostapling, that aided Covidien this quarter, so -- and we mentioned that to our prepared remarks. When you take those one-time events out, including the -- some reseller stocking, the business is performing extremely well. You just look at the marketplace growth, competition and where we are in terms of getting Tri-Staple penetration across the world. And I want to remind the folks on the phone that Covidien has higher market share in endostapling than in open stapling. In MIS, trends are very positive on a global basis in terms of adoption. So Covidien will have the upper hand in benefiting from those trends, as we have extraordinary products, as well as we have market share leadership.

The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Energy-based devices, capital spending pressure in Europe last quarter, can you give us an update on where that is?
Jose E. Almeida
Yes. We are not a bellwether company for capital utilization. But I would say it's flat in the quarter for most of our products. We see capital pickup in emerging markets, primarily in ventilation. You can see the results of our acquisition. Newport's doing very well in emerging markets. But other than that, primarily in Europe for the Energy capital, was flat in the quarter. So a lot of our growth that you've seen in Energy was not driven by capital. And as I said in the last conference call, capital sales for Energy is very lumpy and should not be taken as an indication of positive or negative for the overall capital market.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Then as my second question, I know there is a GPO contract in the Vascular piece, which was lost which made the comps a little bit more difficult. Is there a way to quantify that impact on the quarter?
Jose E. Almeida
What we have is this has anniversaried already. But when you lose a GPO contract, you goes through a significant amount of work to retain your customers and some of them can be retained, and the conversion is not immediate. So when you lose it, you still have the lingering effect that will go probably 12 to 18 months, and it goes and tails off. So I would not have enough data to give you right now in terms of quantifying that. But I tell you that what's more impactful this quarter for that business, the compression business, was not this contract that was lost. As I said, we're at the tail end of it -- was the destocking of some of the distributors in the order processing, which is -- which we rarely comment, but we thought it was appropriate to comment this time.

The next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
First question is on capital allocation. You did a significant amount of share buyback this quarter. Last year, last fall, you did a major dividend hike. And I'm just wondering, does the greater share buyback here in the near term, does it limit the dividend increase that we could see this fall?
Charles J. Dockendorff
No, Glenn. We expect to have a pretty good increase in our dividend as well. We've talked about how much should be dividend and share repurchase. But the dividend increase will clearly be above and ahead of our earnings growth. And we expect to continue that over the foreseeable future. I think our board is committed to do that and drive up the dividend and the yield on that piece of it, so -- and the part of free cash flow that we payout, and we'll continue to repurchase shares in the open market as well. Again, we've committed to that 50%. We haven't done that many deals this year, but we've made a significant buyback in the third quarter. We also, after the pharma spin, we've had good cash flow, and we're -- we have over $2.1 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which, again -- and Cole mentioned earlier, we have access to, which we can utilize with the capital allocation dividend and acquisitions. So we feel real good about the capital of the company, the cash flow of the company, what it's generating and our ability to reinvest that in new acquisitions and to continue on with our share repurchase and dividend strategy.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
And the timing of a dividend increase, I remember, last year, I think it was like October and November, which coincided with one of your last board meetings, would that be fair to assume reasonable timing for this year?
Charles J. Dockendorff
It's in the fall. We do that once a year and, typically, it's right near the end of our fiscal year.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then Chuck, just lastly, on FX, the move in the dollar here in the last few months shouldn't be a major surprise. But then I'm just wondering as you look at Street models, not just for 4Q, but for next year, do you think the Street is adequately modeled in FX from both the top line and the bottom line point of view?
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think what we've seen is just this constant deterioration in the FX as we've gone into each quarter. So as we started Q3, we had one set of FX assumptions or where they were. It deteriorated as we finished Q3. In the last couple of weeks, there's been a slight rebound, but it's hard to say. And I think the Street reflects more of where we were at the beginning of Q3, where we gave our last guidance -- or our last earnings call, I think it's more reflective than that. So there has been slight deterioration in the FX since that point in time.
Coleman N. Lannum
Glenn, I think that's a good point. I mean, the reality is, as you know, everyone on the Street does not call us up and tell us when, why or how they may be changing numbers. But I think it's important to note that not everyone is as timely and diligent in changing models as everyone else is. It varies from person to person. Certainly, there's some people out there that haven't changed their models in extended period of time, almost by definition, given the change in rates over the last several months. Unless they were amazingly accurate in predicting the future, they have not incorporated those changes.

The next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
One for Joe, and then one for Chuck. Joe, I just was hoping that you might talk a little bit again about, strategically, how you're thinking about sort of moving from manual laparoscopy to somewhere in the middle versus robotic surgery? Again, you've always talked about ways to kind of close that gap. And I'm just curious, again, strategically, how you're thinking about it.
Jose E. Almeida
We have a very good R&D group. We now have R&D groups in very different places of the world, looking at different ways to advance endostapling. And for us is advancement of MIS, whatever we can do to advance MIS from where it is to a place that has 2 major assumptions. That's what you need to pay attention to. One is that the technology deployed does not increase the unit cost of the procedure. Second, the technology deployed will facilitate adoption of MIS on a global basis. Now if we don't have those 2 assumptions clearly defined, if our technology is just increasing cost and procedure volume, for no other reason, then competition amongst hospitals for patients, that's not where Covidien sees itself, because that would be a major technology that Covidien would deploy in the marketplace. But Covidien sees those 2 assumptions as key. If we cannot satisfy those assumptions, we are not going to enter in any advancement in technology, because we don't think it will be sustainable for the future.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
And is there anything -- I know, again, you continue to advance the pipeline, but is there anything, specifically, that we should be paying attention to, perhaps in the last 12 months?
Jose E. Almeida
Not specifically. And this is the kind of the programs that we have in-house that we usually disclose very little.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then, Chuck, obviously, all the comments that you've made, which have certainly been consistent over the past several quarters about, again, expectations for deploying capital for both share repurchase and dividends as well as M&A, would suggest that you guys remain committed to doing acquisitions. And I'm wondering, since you are an acquisitive company, and presumably, you're going to continue to be one, any thoughts around moving more towards convention of reporting EPS when you exclude deal-related amortization?
Charles J. Dockendorff
We've had talks on that. I think what we're doing now is we're disclosing our amortization, so you can see it clearly on the press release and in our earnings announcements. So people want to make a comparable evaluation with us and other companies, they can do that. It certainly is something that we could consider going forward, if we think that, that would give the investors a better picture of why we're doing these acquisitions and the value that it's driving. We do look at all of our deals, again, on a cash-on-cash basis. So it's internal rates of return in NPV, and we have hurdles that we go through that. That's the way we see is driving value in the company is to drive up the cash flow of the company long term. And so that's the way we make all our investment decisions really around everything. So a cash EPS would be consistent with the way we look at our investment strategy.
Coleman N. Lannum
Larry, I would remind you that as we sit today, the vast majority of large cap med tech companies continue to report earnings on a traditional accounting basis, the same way we do. And while that's the case for comparability, we're always considerate. We're likely to keep doing it that way. Operator, we're at the bottom of the hour. I want to try to get 2 quick -- very quick questions in, and then we'll have to wrap up, please.

The next question comes from the line of Brooks West of Piper Jaffrey.
Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Just one for me at this point. Your competitor, who is coming back onto the market in peripheral stents, appears to be aggressively using price to retake share. And I'm just wondering, do you guys think that will actually take the market down a step and maybe take longer to anniversary? Or would you expect that to moderate near term?
Jose E. Almeida
Let me answer that one. We think that we can answer for our competitor taking the price down. Our reaction is that the value of our portfolio is not solely based on the stent. So if Covidien can participate in a more comprehensive contracting manner with the physician on lab or with the institution, we will. And we've been deploying this lately and has been successful. We are not engaging in every single bit. Not every business is a good business and depends upon the customer and the profitability of that account for Covidien. Covidien may elect to participate in that, we're not. But in terms of their strategy and for how long it's going to take, you're better off asking them.
Coleman N. Lannum
And Operator, one last quick question, then we need to wrap.
Operator
Okay. It comes from the line of Jason Wittes of Brean Capital.
Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division
So, I guess, real quick. For Oximetry, obviously, impressive growth this quarter, but you're implying that you'll likely continue to grow above the market, which, I think, is kind of growing at mid-single digits you implied. If you could just help us out and give us kind of a breakdown between U.S., OUS and acquisitions this quarter to sort of kind of think about the rates going forward for the business?
Jose E. Almeida
Let me answer part of your question, and I'll pass on to Cole. We look at monitoring. And when we talk to the Street, we talk about Oximetry monitoring. And today, Covidien has many different parameters in the monitoring space. So when we say we're going to grow slightly above market, it's on the monitoring side, not SPO2 necessarily, okay? So we do have a good momentum in SPO2, but we have other parameters in the marketplace including the respiration rate coming up in 2014 and a version -- OEM version. We have capnography, we have depth of anesthesia, we have cerebral Oximetry, and all of them are doing well. In terms of the numbers -- in terms of regional numbers, I'll pass on to Cole --
Coleman N. Lannum
Yes. The way we think of it, the M&A there was primarily for Oridion. It was, ballpark, $25 million in the quarter. Although it -- understand that it has been growing pretty significantly. And U.S. and OUS actually have both grown really well in that business. We're showing mid single-digit growth, really, in both of them.
Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division
Okay. And just one very quick follow-up. Is there an update on potential -- for market return of Duet TRS in the U.S.?
Jose E. Almeida
We are working now with the FDA. And we probably are looking into another 12 months in terms of filings and the ability to go back, but we indeed have a product that looks really good, so we're excited about it.
