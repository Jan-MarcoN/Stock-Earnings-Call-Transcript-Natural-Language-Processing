James E. Craddock
Thanks, Toni. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Let's start with a few of the highlights included in yesterday's earnings release. In the third quarter, we achieved the highest production levels in company history. We increased total daily production by 44% versus 2013, and 20% compared to the second quarter. We also achieved record highs in each of our product components: oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. We announced the successful completion of 7 operated Permian horizontal wells in Reeves County.
Through the first 9 months of 2014, we have made solid progress on our Delaware Basin delineation program. Lastly, we reaffirmed our 2014 annual capital guidance and indicated we expect to perform at the high end of our prior production guidance range.
On Slide 4 in our slide deck, we show our total resource and production growth trends since 2009, the year of our initial Eagle Ford discovery well. The chart highlights the production profile of our Eagle Ford production and the increasing Permian contribution. Production for the third quarter averaged 73,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Included on the chart is our 2014 actual production through the first 9 months, along with the fourth quarter production guidance range of 72,000 to 74,000 BOEs per day.
Fourth quarter production is coming in roughly flattish to the third quarter as a result of anticipated lower capital spending intensity. Still, we're on track to deliver more than 30% year-over-year production growth in 2014.
A key accomplishment in the quarter was the completion of seven operated horizontal wells in Reeves County. We successfully completed six operated Wolfcamp A wells, with average gross 7-day IP rates of more than 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. Actually, these latest Wolfcamp A wells are more impressive that, that number may indicate at first blush.
We believe one of the wells, the Deacon Jim 6 #1H, is in a geologically challenged area. John Clayton will tell you more about that in a moment. If you take out the Deacon Jim, the average is about 1,400 BOEs per day for the 5 wells. If you then normalize for 5,000-foot laterals, the average on the 5 new A wells rises to about 1,800 BOEs per day per well. We're continuing to make good progress on optimizing our completion methods in the Wolfcamp A.
In addition, in early July, we completed a New Ventures test in the Third Bone Springs that we announced on our second quarter call in August. The Johnny Ringo 9 #2H had a preliminary gross 7-day IP of approximately 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent per day. After fully cleaning up on flowback, the final gross 7-day stabilized IP was 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day for this 3,900-foot lateral length well. We're very pleased with the results of this second tranche of our Permian horizontal completions.
As detailed in the earnings release, we are reaffirming our 2014 annual capital guidance at $1.2 billion, which excludes acquisition capital, and expect to perform at the high end of our prior full year 2014 production guidance range of 63,000 to 66,000 BOEs per day. We've also provided detailed fourth quarter 2014 guidance on a per unit basis for expenses to assist in modeling.
Because we realize that the market is very interested in what E&P companies are thinking about their 2015 plans, we're also providing a look ahead for '15. We're still working on our 2015 budget and expect to release our final board-approved budget in December.
For those of us that have worked in this industry for several decades, these past few weeks have a familiar feel to them. We've seen this movie before. Commodity prices have been volatile. They've dropped precipitously and equity values have fallen. We, nonetheless, believe we can continue to execute on our strategic plans in this commodity price environment.
The vast majority of our Eagle Ford portfolio is economic to a breakeven price of about $30 per barrel. That allows us to spend a little less capital on the Eagle Ford and still get growth and outstanding results.
As we've said before, we see most of our cash recovery in the first year of spend with these wells. Our Wolfcamp A horizontal wells are competitive as well, with a breakeven price of about $45 per barrel.
For some time now, Rosetta has stated that we're committed to protecting our balance sheet. As you know we, as an industry, have been out spending cash flow at an unsustainable pace. When the 2015 oil price strip was north of $9 a barrel, we were already on a path to modestly reduce our 2015 capital spending so that the rate of cash flow growth would exceed the rate of debt increase.
Given the current price outlook, we are signaling a 2015 capital program of $950 million. It is interesting that while this budget is down from the $1.2 billion we spent this year, it will still be our second largest capital budget in the company's history.
The preliminary capital split is roughly 55% Eagle Ford and 45% Permian. This means that our Eagle Ford capital for next year will be lower than it was this year. In the Eagle Ford, we have allocated capital to focus on high rate of return projects in our portfolio.
On the flip side, this means that our Permian capital for next year will be higher than it was this year, by roughly 25%. In the Permian, we continue to lock the well results we're seeing in the Delaware and we are continuing to improve the economic returns through optimization of both drilling and completion designs as well as understanding the rocks better through our delineation efforts.
Under our proposed 2015 plan, we expect to deliver more than 20% annual production growth, but with 20% less total capital than in 2014. We don't see any big changes coming in natural gas prices in the near term, so we've made the decision to forego further capital investments in our Eagle Ford dry gas assets, which are a small percentage of our current inventory of well locations. We will continue to watch commodity prices as we move through this budget process, but this gives you an idea of how we may act if there's no short-term improvement in prices.
Now let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide a summary of our financial results.
John E. Hagale
Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, all of the information I'm reviewing today is contained in our 10-Q as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC yesterday and are available on our website.
As outlined in our press release, adjusted net income for the quarter, that's non-GAAP, was $33 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus net income -- adjusted net income of $62 million or $1.01 a share a year ago. The third quarter 2014 adjusted net income excludes unrealized derivative gains and a reserve for commercial dispute. The decrease in third quarter adjusted net income, when you look at it versus the prior year, was mainly due to lower oil prices, higher DD&A expense, interest expense and LOE, partially offset by significantly higher production.
Our third quarter average realized oil price, when you exclude derivatives, was $86 a barrel. That's LLS minus about $14, which was at the high end of the differential guidance we gave you a quarter ago, that guidance being LLS minus $12 to $14. The third quarter average was down about $14 from a year ago and down almost $8 in the second quarter. Our realized price in the third quarter was lower relative to LLS, primarily due to continued pipeline constraints in the Permian. The Cushing to Midland differential for the quarter was around $10, but recent indications have it currently trading below $5 for the fourth quarter. I would still probably guide to LLS minus $12 to $14 for the fourth quarter, but we do see things improving, and that's $12 to $14 for the total company.
For the remainder of the year, when you look at NGL prices, I would look at Mont Belvieu minus $4 to $5. That differential will move around a little bit, depending on the plants that we are moving product to. It should be on the lower end of that range as we close out the year, as we end up moving to a plant that we've contracted with that's coming back online towards the end of the year.
On the natural gas side of things, you ought to see gas prices that hover around Houston Ship Channel. We provided production and expense guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014 in the release, and we show it again on Slide 5. The third quarter per unit expenses were largely in line or below the guidance we gave you a quarter ago. DD&A was higher for the quarter, but in line with the full year guidance.
Going forward in 2015 to further assist your modeling of the financials, we plan on start providing the upcoming quarter's capital production and per unit guidance in addition to the full year guidance.
On hedging. As part of our active and disciplined hedging strategy, we evaluate opportunities to add to our derivative positions on our production when the price conditions warrant. Our target is to hedge between 1/3 and 1/2 of our expected production, again, depending on prices.
For 2015, we have a little bit over 1/2 of our oil hedged, 1/2 of our natural gas hedged and about 1/4 of our NGL product hedged. And as you saw from the release, the oil is hedged at around $90. There's a detailed summary of our derivative position as of October 31 in the release.
Lastly, as of September 30, our semiannual borrowing base redetermination was completed. The lender group reconfirmed the borrowing base at $950 million and a committed amount of $800 million. At the end of the third quarter, we had $690 million undrawn under the revolver. That's a pretty good position to be in the current price environment.
Now let me turn the call over to John Clayton.
John D. Clayton
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Despite the recent commodity price volatility in our industry, we had a tremendous quarter operationally and I'm very proud of our organization. I will briefly review the quarterly highlights as well as touch on some of the near-term catalysts.
Our third quarter production came in at a record 73,500 BOEs per day, up from the 61,500 BOEs per day that we produced in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by our third row at Gates Ranch starting to come online, some nice Eagle Ford run times overall and some nice well results in the Permian Basin.
But before we move to the Permian and go over some of our well results, I wanted to update you on how we're seeing our Upper Eagle Ford program going forward. Last quarter, I discussed our pilot activities at length so I won't spend time going over where we have been. But please turn to Slide 7, where we have an updated production plot of the pilots at L&E and eastern Gates. These are the 2 pilots where we lowered the upper well placement down to the base of the Upper Eagle Ford section. As you can see, the upper wells continued to perform very well, and we now have 6 to 9 months of data on these pilots. We're encouraged with this performance as it reaffirms the potential we see in the upper section of the Eagle Ford and select areas of our acreage.
During the fourth quarter of this year, we have now begun drilling upper wells at Briscoe Ranch, and have plans in 2015 to begin Upper Eagle Ford wells in northern Gates.
Slide 8 shows the cross-section of type logs that you have seen before and highlights the thickness of the Upper Eagle Ford relative to the Lower Eagle Ford. The two type logs on the far right show the northern Gates Ranch and Briscoe Ranch sections for your reference. We like the thicker Upper Eagle Ford sections for staggered development because although the upper sections have less porosity than the lower, we can make that up with thickness and get an attractive porosity foot or PH calculation.
In an un-risked success case, we have nearly 300 Upper Eagle Ford locations across our L&E, Briscoe and northern Gates Ranch acreage. Upper Eagle Ford EURs remain to be determined, but early performance suggests significant potential. Going forward, if you hear us use the term staggered development, this means we are drilling both Upper and Lower Eagle Ford wells in a staggered offset pattern.
Now let's talk Permian. I would like to briefly describe to you our most recent wells that were in the press release as well as give you our views on fluid type, sand concentration and lateral lengths.
Let's begin with the Permian completions that we announced last night. We've had another quarter of tremendous progress in the Delaware Basin and we're very pleased with what we are seeing, not only by us, but other operators in the immediate area.
So please turn to Slide 10, and let's review our well results in a bit more detail. This is a map of our core Reeves County position. In solid yellow are the operated leases, where we have 100% working interest. In hashed yellow are the leases where we have greater than 50% working interest and we operate. In the areas in gray, we have less than 50% working interest and do not operate. Keep in mind that these colors may change from time to time as we trade interest and leases with other operators to make the play more efficient for both us and them.
As a reminder, we currently sit at roughly 47,000 net acres in Reeves County, which is up from the 40,000-net-acre position when we entered the play 18 months ago. The wells in solid blue are the 10 horizontal wells that Rosetta has completed through the end of the second quarter. 7 of those 10 wells were chosen to begin our delineation of the Wolfbone across our acreage position. 3 of those 10 wells were picked to begin our understanding of proper well spacing.
During the third quarter, we added another 6 Wolfcamp A completions and a Third Bone Spring well. The Bone Spring well, the Johnny Ringo well, which is shown in purple, was mentioned on our August call as it was early in the stages of its flowback. Here, we now have a 7-day stabilized rate, and this updated rate is higher than what I mentioned on the last call, so obviously, we're very pleased with its performance. This well confirms our original thoughts on the potential of the overpressured benches of the Bone Spring.
Of the 6 Wolfcamp wells, the farthest Northeast completion, the Deacon Jim, was designed to test the slick water completion in what we have referred to in the past as the area of our acreage that sits on a structural nose, is slightly more fractured and has a much higher gas-oil ratio. The Deacon Jim's well results are on the lower end of our expectations, but the acreage sits on this nose appears to be minimal. If you recall, the Calamity Jane well is roughly 5 miles south of this well, and it is one of our best wells to date in the Wolfcamp A bench, so the structural nose is not widespread.
You also see that we have a well near our Deacon Jim located in green that has been drilled but awaiting completion. This well is an overpressured Bone Spring well rather than a Wolfcamp A well, and it will be completed in January.
Of our remaining new wells this quarter, the City of Pecos well is our farthest northwest well to date. It is a 1.5 miles north of the Balmorhea well. If you recall, the Balmorhea well is a longer lateral well that was completed with our old completion design. The recent City of Pecos well was completed with our new design, and it is significantly outperforming the older well. The Dynamite Dan well is now our farthest westernmost well, and we're very pleased with the geographic extension this well results has given us as we move to the west.
The Monroe well and the Tall Texan well, which are both performing very nicely, will give us near bilateral length comparisons to the Intrepid well, which is in the section offsetting them to the east and south. The recently completed Intrepid well is a 7,000-foot lateral and is currently flowing back. It's very early in the flowback, but early time results are indicating that this has the potential to be one of our very best wells to date.
The Sheriff Woody well rounds off our activity for the quarter, and it is 2 miles east of our Black Jack 3-well spacing test. As you can see, it also has displayed tremendous well performance so far.
So that brings our completed horizontal well count to 17. Also shown on this map, in green, are the 12 horizontal well locations that have been drilled and are awaiting completion. As you can see, our focus is, and has been, on delineation of the subsurface.
Let me now say a few comments on the completion side. As I've discussed on our call last quarter, during the summer, we changed over to a slick water-initiated completion design on our Reeves County wells to give us some more complex fracture initiation. That remains our design today, and all of the wells that I just mentioned utilize slick water as the initiating fluid.
Now some brief color on sand concentrations. Although we have only completed 17 horizontal wells so far, we're continuing to optimize our sand concentrations. Early on, we started pumping 900 pounds of proppant per lateral foot for our initial Wolfcamp wells. In the second quarter of this year, we increased the proppant concentrations in the Wolfcamp to roughly 1,200 pounds per lateral foot. The wells I just reported out on were all on this 1,200 range.
Our next group of Wolfcamp wells, the ones in green, that have been drilled and awaiting completion, will all be pumped with a minimum of 1,500 pounds per lateral foot. We do know that this is not an infinite relationship, but thus far the incremental investment of pumping more sand in the Wolfcamp has compelling economics. I'm looking forward to seeing the results of the 1,500-pound concentrations in our next batch of completions.
If you now turn to Slide 11, you can see that our completion design changes are paying dividends. This slide shows all of our operated horizontal wells completed today in chronological order. Here, we're plotting the average 30-day rate per 1,000-foot of lateral interval completed. You can see that we changed completion fluid designs after our fifth well right before the Black Jack wells. It is here where we went from a gel initial fluid to a slick water initial fluid. The average 30-day rate per 1,000-foot for a Wolfcamp A well prior to the change was 129 barrels of oil equivalent per day. After the design change, the average Wolfcamp A well, excluding the Deacon Jim well, which we believe is a geologic anomaly, calculates to be 309 BOEs per day or roughly 140% improvement.
I will also be curious to watch these numbers as we continue to increase the proppant amounts to north of 1,500 pounds per foot.
Now let's talk lateral lengths and what is happening in Reeves County. Field rules, lease geometries and ownership variabilities all play a role in lateral lengths being completed. With the push from operators, field rules were changed about 4 months ago to reduce perpendicular lease line offsets from 467 feet down to 200 feet. In other words, for a 640-acre section of leasehold, we can drill equal parallel wells, with a lateral length of roughly 4,900 feet, whereas 4 months ago, we can only drill equal parallel wells with lateral lengths of 4,350 feet. Now if we have lease geometries that are greater than 640 acres with favorable ownerships, we can, and prefer, to drill longer laterals. The recently completed 7,000-foot Intrepid well is an example of this.
With that said, our typical well is modeled at 5,000 feet. Some wells will be shorter and some will be significantly longer, but our type well is 5,000 feet.
If you now turn to Slide 12, which is my last slide, you will see our 3Q wells and their production. This production is normalized and plotted against our initial type curve of 550,000 BOEs. We will make the changes to the type curves as more well performance history is gathered.
That concludes my operational remarks. And as always, I look forward to future calls to keep you up-to-date on our operational activities in South Texas and the Permian.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, John. Today, we want to leave you with 4 key messages that differentiate Rosetta in today's environment. First, Rosetta has a portfolio of high-return projects to support competitive production growth and contribute to longer-term value growth. Our operations are located in 2 of the most active basins, with some of the lowest breakeven costs. And our technical teams continue to seek ways to improve the efficiency of operations by decreasing costs and increasing recoveries.
Second, Rosetta has a balanced commodity mix. Our third quarter commodity mix was 29% crude oil, 35% NGLs and 36% natural gas.
Third, Rosetta is focused on financial discipline to maintain flexibility throughout the inevitable commodity price cycles. As John mentioned, we have an active hedging program and are committed to protecting our balance sheet and ensuring adequate liquidity.
And fourth, Rosetta has an experienced senior leadership team that has worked in numerous industry cycles and understand what it takes to position the company to succeed.
In summary, we are well positioned to execute our long-term growth strategies in a potentially challenging future price environment.
Before we open the call for Q&A, I want to thank Rosetta's technical, operating and business support teams for all their hard work over the first 9 months of 2014. We should all be proud of the effort that we've put forth and the results we've achieved as a company.
I'll now turn the call back to the moderators so that we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Say, John, just wanting your thoughts -- I guess for you or Jim. Obviously, great upcoming growth and third quarter growth from the Delaware Basin. Just your thoughts when you look at, I guess, kind of on a go-forward basis for 2015, certainly, you're going to have big production growth there. So what are your thoughts on production growth of the Delaware Basin versus the Eagle Ford? And then just margins around the 2 plays as you see it.
James E. Craddock
Yes, Neal, this is Jim. Yes, we did see a pretty nice bump in growth in 3Q from the Delaware, and we expect to see it keep growing in 2015. Kind of, again, talking through the capital allocation, 55% of our capital goes to Eagle Ford and 45% to Permian. We expect Permian to be about 12% of the production range we put out for 2015. So that's going to be kind of 9,000 to 10,000 barrels a day. So you'll see it continue to grow from where it is today. Likewise, if you do the math, the Eagle Ford continues to grow as well. So we like both those areas, and we think they both will deliver some nice performance in the next year.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
And then, just lastly, maybe for the other John, as far as just you certainly have more than ample liquidity to say the least. Just your thoughts on debt metrics going forward, besides the $950 million CapEx, if -- obviously, it's a question of if oil would continue to fall, your thoughts about a further cut or how you look at that. Is it just based on through your debt metrics, liquidity? How do you all look at that?
John E. Hagale
I think the numbers -- this is Hagale. I think the numbers that we've shown or talked about today put us in a pretty good position to have flexibility. Clearly, with prices where they are, I don't think the debt metric is going to improve, but they're not going to deteriorate like they might if you had a significant outspend. With the numbers we're looking at today, I think the numbers will be in a range that are okay for us. We've got an awful lot of liquidity that helps us do things. And our balance sheet, really, if you look at us versus peers, we're kind of in the middle of the debt metrics as far as leverage. So I feel pretty good about things. All you guys remember, I came out of the investment grade world, so I like things to be better. But fact of the matter is, where we are today is not too bad.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe with TPH.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
I just wanted to dig in, I guess, a little bit more on the Delaware Basin well results. So obviously, the 310 BOEs per day on 1,000-foot basis is well ahead of your 218 in your type curve. So I just wondered, could you maybe provide some more color around the parameters that are baked into your 550 MBoe type curve and, in particular, the B factor?
John D. Clayton
Michael, this is Clayton. Without getting into too much detail, one, probably because I'm not knowledgeable enough to go as far down as you can on stuff like that, we published a 550,000 BOE type curve very early on in the play. A lot of it was focused on vertical well productivity out of the Wolfcamp A, and then trying to build that into an analogy of the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date in the Wolfcamp A. And one of the things we try to do is not jerk our type curves around a whole lot, and with the amount of activity, especially in north-central Reeves County, where we are, I think it's just wise to wait a little longer. I think we're seeing what you are. These last group of wells, especially with the change in completion, look to be performing, early time, better than our type curves. We've got plenty of room on the recovery factors. I think if you remember early on, recovery factors in the area are in the single digits. So the amount of hydrocarbons don't bother us. But we came out with a very preliminary type curve. It's got a B factor on it. I don't know if we published that, but the facts of the matter are, we'll come out with a lot more detail if we update the type curve just because, statistically, we'll have a much large population of data to pull from, not only ours but offset operators. And then when you look -- and I know I'm rambling here, but I think all this is probably -- will help you a little bit. If you look at all the changes we've made in just 17 wells -- we reported out on 16, the 17th well is the Intrepid, but we changed our fluid design. The first 5 were done with the gel and then the last 12 were done with the slick water. And then that's kind of where industry is, and I think that was a great move. We've also changed our stage spacing. I think, originally, we were in the 300-foot range and we're reducing it down to about 215-foot range. So there's a lot of moving parts to it and then we focus now on sand concentrations and raising those. I mentioned 1,500 pounds per foot is going to be where the next tranche is. And we're looking at 1,800 and something north of 2,000 on the few wells going forward, too. So there's a lot of moving parts, and I think it's such a broad area. The next type curve is going to have a lot more technical work behind it than the early type curves that the industry has put out there so.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Great, that's very helpful. And I guess maybe just the last thing related to Delaware Basin is just, if think about your budget next year, I think you said you'll do about 45% of that in the Delaware. So I guess, how do you all see well costs trending in that area, particularly as you transition to a much more horizontal-dominated drilling program?
John D. Clayton
Well, right now, the Permian as a whole is probably one of the hotter areas as far as service cost. So with this pullback in commodity price, we kind of hope the service companies that we worked with over the years can react a little quicker to the drop in prices, and we'll start seeing some savings on the service side. But tubulars are up slightly. I think 2% to 5% the last time we looked at it, but we think that will probably soften as operators reduce their rig count out there. And we're one of the companies that's increasing our activity in the Permian, so we hope to kind of maybe take advantage of that. As far as rig contracts, they were trending upward on day rates, but we'll look for that to level out. And then companies like ourselves that are ramping up, that are committed to plays for a little longer, we hope to maybe work those costs down. But it's one of the hotter basins. We've seen prices soften in the Eagle Ford a lot more than maybe the Permian leveling out. But as volatile as these prices are and -- we're just fortunate to have projects out there that have breakeven cost of $45 a barrel to where we can deploy capital. And I think that there's a lot of wells that have been drilled on the fringes that kind of get overlooked in a $90 to $100 world. So hopefully, we're going to take advantage of that extra supply coming to market and lower some of our cost.
James E. Craddock
And Michael, I would just add that we're probably about a year away from this, is my sense, but there is another leg of cost savings that we see out there, and that's related to pad drilling, pattern development. We've seen it in the Eagle Ford and there, we were seeing $0.5 million of well savings once we went to 3-well pads, and we've since gone to more wells per pad and so forth. I think that's ahead of us in the Permian but I think it's probably still a year out. Our plans for next year really kind of continued the delineation program that's under way now. But it's out there and it's real. We'll get to it at some point. And there's very real savings we'll see when we start going to multiple wells per pad and pattern development.

Our next question comes from the line of Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
Yes, so 2 questions, if I may. Wolfcamp C, when would you guys go back to working on the Wolfcamp C? Because Energen has a pretty good well this quarter. Then, longer lateral, now that you've played with more sand, closer spacing, slick water, would longer lateral kind of sit into your final development scheme knowing that you guys have actually very contiguous footprint?
John D. Clayton
Irene, this is Clayton. The first question, I guess, is on the Wolfcamp C. This other Intrepid well you're talking about is kind of in the gassier area of the play. I think as a crow flies, it's probably 20 miles from where we are. I didn't take out a ruler and measure it, but fantastic well. It's quite a bit gassier, though, than where we are. The way these leases work out here -- and I know you know this, but just to answer the question, as long as you're in the primary term, you don't have to drill it all. But then, once you go into the continuous drilling, as long as you're developing, there's not a whole lot of depth severance, so all the Wolfcamp C rights you save [ph] by continuous drilling in the A. And if you look at 47,000 net acres in Reeves County, if you gross that up, we're looking at -- I don't know the exact number, but something north of 70,000 acres in size that we've got to delineate in just the Wolfcamp A bench. So we've spent most of our time there. Hopefully, there's -- there's quite a bit of larger companies in the area, maybe they'll drill some more wells than we are in the lower zones and de-risk that for us. But right now, I think we've got our hands full trying to delineate nearly 70,000, 75,000 gross acres in just the Wolfcamp A. And then I think you saw the Bone Spring well results, which was extremely favorable. Now that sits on top of the Wolfcamp A, and we've got the same amount of acreage and rights over that zone. So it's a lot of acreage. We don't count it like the Midland guys. I think they take it, multiply it by the number of benches, and if we did that math, we're pretty close to 200,000 acres we've got to develop. So it's a pretty big chunk of acreage.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
Got you. And how about extended laterals?
John D. Clayton
We've swapped some acreage position with other operators because when we start drilling past the 640s, the way these leases are over on the Delaware side, we want to maintain majority interest in those. The Intrepid well is a longer lateral. Our Balmorhea well is a longer lateral. We had a Gaucho well that was a longer lateral. So I think you'll start to see us try to consolidate acreage as we go forward and get traction with other operators and maximizing it. So we drilled 3 so far, and every chance we can to maintain operatorship and drill longer laterals is going to be the way to go. I didn't give a date -- or a rate on the Intrepid well. We want to get it cleaned up. It's going to be a pretty good well. It's probably going to be one of our best wells to date. And when we report out on it, we'll dissect it per thousand foot and per stage and all that stuff. But I think you'll see that anytime you can add longer laterals, it's got incremental economics that can be compete with anything in the portfolio.

Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC
One quick question on your -- just your completed well costs in the Eagle Ford and Permian in the third quarter, and any expectations for fourth quarter.
John D. Clayton
Yes, David. This is Clayton. I'll start with the Eagle Ford. On a typical 5,000-foot well -- and the reason I'm caveated with that, as you move forward, our laterals on that Row 3 start approaching 7,000 foot as you go west. But with a normal sand concentration, and that's with our old design of about 900 pounds per linear foot, which is what we've pumped through the third -- or maybe halfway through the third quarter, we're at about $5.75 million or $6 million. As we've now started to go from, or have gone, from ceramic to sand, which lowered the cost, we're starting to pump larger volumes of sand. The fourth quarter, I think we're going to average about 1,700 pounds of sand per linear lateral foot. And then I think you'll see us, as we transition into 2015, we're going to have some results that are north of 2,500 pounds per lateral foot. So if the reservoir is going to continue to perform like we think it is, you'll see us putting quite a bit more sand in place than when we used to put ceramic proppant. Now what we don't know is how does that change our drainage radiuses and all that good stuff as we pump 3x the amount of sand in these wells. But costs will go up accordingly on there. Most of the wells in the Permian we drilled in the quarter were -- I don't know what the exact average was if you take out the 7,000-foot Intrepid well, but maybe a little north of 4,000 feet. And I think those wells, on average, are about $9 million a well. I think we -- I think we're AFE-ing them for somewhere right around there, and that's what they're coming in at.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC
Okay. And then as you think about -- fourth quarter workover expenses were guided lower, and as we run into 2015, should we just assume a more normalized per barrel expense rate for next year?
John D. Clayton
We'll give more detail when we formalize our budget in '15, but I would like to give some color on the workover deal, because you're right. If you go back in time, as I read some of the releases that are coming out by some of our peers, they're starting to experience in full development mode, especially in the Eagle Ford, some of the lumpiness on shutting in wells and buffer pads and all that good stuff, and that's the stuff we experienced a year ago. And now we're kind of on smooth sailing because we've got a systematic approach. And if you look at workovers now in these same plays, what we noticed in the second and third quarter, we're just now starting to go back into wells that have been producing for 2 to 3 years and there's some efficiencies gained on not only doing nodal analysis and understanding restrictions in the well, but cleaning out laterals, cleaning out debris in laterals and so forth and getting those wells more optimized. So workover expenses were higher, as you mentioned, behind us. We've modeled it lower in the fourth quarter. But I think you'll see these plays in these high-rate wells at the beginning, that decline pretty fast, that have long laterals. There's going to be some workover expenses in the future, probably 2 to 3 years, after the initial completion, where it's very prudent for an operator to go in, start cleaning out. And I think what they'll find is, over that time, the rates come up quite a bit when they go in and get that lateral cleaned out after 2 to 3 years of production.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Gamble from Simmons & Company.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
I appreciate you being so diligent with the CapEx numbers. I think it's refreshing to hear someone actually talk about pulling those numbers down year-on-year, given the oil price that we're staring at. A question on that. How much flexibility is there in that $950 million number, I guess both for the upside and to downside, if we do have either a continued retreat on the oil price side? Or in the better case scenario where that oil price goes up, just from a standpoint of -- where is that maintenance number in the Eagle Ford, I think you mentioned the 55% but you kind of are in the 5.25 range, could you take that down further if you needed to? And then on the other side of that, if oil prices did go up, how hard would it be to add another rig for the Permian at some point next year?
James E. Craddock
Yes, Brian, good question. So I think there's quite a bit of flexibility that we have in terms of kind of building it up from the ground up. We think kind of the minimum spend out there is to keep the acreage together in our 2 core areas. That number is probably around $400 million. We all worked it real hard, but it's probably something like that. And it's probably equally split between the Eagle Ford and Permian. It probably would require a few more vertical wells in Permian that we'd like to do. But that's sort of the baseline, and then we go up from there. So we're drilling discretionary wells in both areas that we think generate great returns. In this $950 million case, so obviously, we can turn on more capital if we see product prices improve. So there's a little bit of a lag to -- obviously, to go from drilling to getting those wells completed, and so depending on kind of the circumstances, that may not show up much in the year in which it happens or not, it sort of depends. But we're going to watch it through the end of the year. We reserve the right to change this number if we think commodity prices are one way or the other from where there are today. But the bottom line is we feel pretty comfortable with our flexibility here and we kind of like the circumstances we have with these wells.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. And I think you mentioned you still had a little bit of an infrastructure issue on the pipes in Q3. Was that specifically roll over from Q2 and that's now completed? Or was that something separate? And then is there anything else on the infrastructure side that you're dealing with, either in Q4 or as we walk into '15?
John E. Hagale
Are you talking about the takeaway out of the Permian? Was that the piece you were talking about?
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Yes, John. That's right.
John E. Hagale
Yes, Bridge Tex came on kind of midway through the quarter, and you started seeing the differentials coming down as they came on. And we got more pipes coming on over the next year or so. So like I said in my remarks, I think we averaged about $10 differential to the Permian in Q3, and we're seeing quotes out there that are probably a little less than $5 going forward right now. So you saw that come in when Bridge Tex came on.

Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo.
Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just over in the Eagle Ford and the Upper Eagle Ford program. Just wanted to get some more details on the 282 potential locations that you might -- that you've identified out there. Does that include locations that would exist on acres that you've developed previously in the Lower Eagle Ford? Or does that all relate to acreage that's been undeveloped in both the Upper and Lower?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Gordon, this is John. I'll get a little detail on it and maybe it'll help you understand it. So if you go to the northern part of Gates, and it's not maybe geographically north, but if you go take that first row of the Eagle Ford, we start getting thicker as you go north and northwest of there. So we've picked a target of about -- it's no secret, I don't think, but it's about 225-foot thickness of the Upper Eagle Ford. And we've taken that thickness area, which is where we think the best part is at Gates to start doing upper development. And most of that first row was drilled at 850-feet between wells. So we are counting Upper Eagle Ford between Lower Eagle Ford wells. And then if you get into the area that's not as square -- and we call it the W area, most of that's still undeveloped. It's in the oilier area. We've gone ahead and included that as well. So I think that northern part of Gates makes up about 1/2 of that number, the total number. And then if you include Briscoe and L&E, which are the farther most central Dimmit asset that we have; and then Briscoe Ranch, which is north of Gates Ranch, those are the areas that we're at our thickest. Now we've excluded Vivion and Light Ranch. We've excluded the southern part of Gates, which is probably the -- 65% of the southern part of Gates -- or 65% of all of Gates. So it doesn't include everything, but it does include some going in up or above wells we've already developed. But it's in the northern part, row 1 in north, which is areas that haven't been as tightly developed.
Gordon Douthat - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then I believe you said earlier that, that -- the Upper Eagle Ford, you plan to test that in northern Gates? Is that a 2015 time frame there for that?
John D. Clayton
It is. We're doing Briscoe right now in fourth quarter this year and then next year, we'll start in northern Gates.

Our next question comes from the line of Welles Fitzpatrick with Johnson Rice.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Obviously, it's nice to see the BVP 54 aligning up on a rate basis. Can you talk about whether you're seeing the pressures and the GORs also aligning up pretty well with the Lower Eagle Ford offsets?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Welles, this is John. Yes, they're lining up to where it doesn't appear to be interference, but the area that we drilled in the BVP, although it was just 100-and-some feet above it, I believe, it does appear to be in the same types of rocks. Now pressures and rates and all that good stuff are in line with what you would expect, but it doesn't appear to us to be we've got 2 wells that are absolutely in the same tank, and that's why they're declining so close to each other, I would say. So far so good, but that is something that we're watching. Now the stuff that Gordon just asked about earlier, that wouldn't even include the area where the BVP 54 is. That's a much thinner section of Upper Eagle Ford, and that's what has encouraged us so much as you go thicker in Gates Ranch, more similar to the L&E well. And so that's what we've targeted. But if we're counting inventory for Upper Eagle Ford, we would not be counting the BVP 54 because it is in an intersection. So I think at some point in time, those curves, because of their proximity to each other in the thinnest of the Upper Eagle Ford, they're probably going to start diverging. But it hadn't occurred yet.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. And then just 1 follow-on. The BVP 53, and even 50 through 52s, did those look similar on the decline or it's another one -- or a place where you wanted them, but out of curiosity?
John D. Clayton
It's almost -- yes, we excluded them because it doesn't -- it doesn't look favorable to us. But as you move up, and you go from the bottom, which is where the 54 well is, I believe, to the next well up, it has less production. And then you go up to the top, where we have the 3 wells at the very top of the Upper Eagle Ford, those 3 are less than the middle Upper Eagle Ford well. So based on those 4 wells or 5 wells, there's a direct correlation to us on how low you are in the section. So it probably tells you the chalk in that area doesn't contribute as prolifically as the Upper Eagle Ford as a package, and the lower you can get maximizes your stimulated rock volume in the Upper Eagle Ford. But there's a direct analogy of the lower-est well in the Upper Eagle Ford performs better than the next lowest, it performs better than the top wells.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Smith with Bank of America.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I just wanted to come back to the capital allocation theme. So in the Eagle Ford, you've talked about that play being economic, down to 30, and your Permian being economic, down to 45. So what's the thought process in ramping activity in the Permian relative to the Eagle Ford next year? Is it an HBP issue or is there something else that's driving that for you guys?
James E. Craddock
There's a little bit of both, I would say, Jason. One is, yes, that we do want to hold the acres together; and the other thing I would say is we are still in the early innings there. We're seeing improving well performance. We've got some things we're trying in terms of a completion design that John's taking you through. We're seeing wells outperform the type curves. So the breakeven prices and all the economics we've thrown out there are based on our existing type curve. What we want to find out is, can we continue to improve that performance? And so we're seeing kind of mid-40% rates of return in the Wolfcamp with that type curve. But if that gets a bit higher, that begins to be very competitive with the Eagle Ford. So -- and we're on a delineation road there that we don't want to prematurely stop. So we've got all those things working in our favor there. And so that's kind of why -- that's the thinking behind the capital allocation between Eagle Ford and Permian.
Jason Smith - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Got it. Okay. And then, when you think about your Permian inventory, are any of the wells you're drilling outside of your disclosed inventory count? And if you can maybe just remind us of the spacing assumptions that are driving your inventory assumptions?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Jason. This is Clayton. So I think the latest public inventory numbers that we have out there were, they predate some of these extension wells that we just added on this last quarter. So I think Toni will update our investor deck here this quarter, most likely going to see the inventory numbers a little larger north of what we've shown in the past, especially in the Wolfcamp A. Every time we step out -- so for instance, if we drill the City of Pecos well and we take a de-risked number and we start adding more and more into inventory. So that's one of the reasons why we're trying to delineate this thing, is to understand what's the true size of the portfolio, not only from capital investment but from a net present value. And that's what we're trying to ascertain right now. So I think you take the last -- you kind of caught me on this one, but you take the last public data, and when we update it this quarter with the 6 additional wells and the continued well performance on the ones we've had prior to that, I think you'll see our inventory numbers go up from what's been last published.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc.
Chris Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
I just wanted to quickly expand on an earlier question. I guess, is there an oil price that would cause you to add another rig to your program next year? And would that be in the Permian or the Eagle Ford?
James E. Craddock
Yes, Chris. I guess what I would say is, the simple answer is yes. There was probably a higher capital number in our heads here a couple of months ago when prices were north of $90. And I think I said in my remarks that even that number was probably a little below what we're spending this year, but it was above the numbers we've put out so far. So there are almost an infinite number of permutations that we could do right now, and so we've given you guys an early look forward. We're going to kind of watch prices and you're going to hear from us again in about a month on a little bit firmer set of plans. But without getting into much speculation, this is where we sit today. It's what we know today. We want to kind of watch it. And then even in the course of middle of next year, if we get different price signals, we can certainly adjust or react to those things.
Chris Stevens - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then has your thought process regarding some bolt-on M&A sort of activity changed at all? Are you still looking at deals in the Eagle Ford and Permian?
James E. Craddock
We still look. Obviously, with this environment and what we said about our balance sheet, using debt to do a lot of that wouldn't be too interesting to us, and using our stock as currency right now sure doesn't feel real good either. So we're a little more on the sidelines today than we were, but we continue to look, and things can change. So we'll -- we are in the game, but we're going to kind of watch things for now.

Our next question comes from the line of John Nelson with Citigroup.
John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I just wanted to get sort of one clarification. The $950 million, that includes D&C facilities and capitalized cost and others? Or is that just the D&C number?
John E. Hagale
No, that's the complete capital. So that would include corporate capital, capitalized interest and facilities, the whole nine yards.
John C. Nelson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. And sort of baked into that early look, would you guys actually be thinking about reducing sort of that increase in proppant concentrations that I think we talked about a lot in this call in order to get down to that number? Or is it just sort of efficiencies that are maybe coming in your program that we might not be accounting for?
John D. Clayton
No, John -- this is Clayton. I think based on the data we've got now, I mean, if you look at going from 129 to 309, the incremental cost of doing things like that -- Jim mentioned breakeven cost of $30 in the Eagle Ford and $45 in the Permian. That incremental dollars to pump more proppant has got the highest returns of anything we do based on where we are today. There will be a point where I think that'll bend over like the yield curve where it's diminishing returns, but we haven't seen that yet.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Guffey with Stifel.
Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
I wonder if you could provide some thoughts on what do you think would be the most optimum way to develop the Wolfcamp A while also testing the Third Bone Spring in the B and the C benches kind of as you head into 2015? Or I guess another -- I'll say it in another way, how many wells in 2015 in the Permian will target something other than the A bench?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Dan. This is John. But we haven't gone into all the details yet. We still need board approval on the budget and we'll be seeking that here in about 3 or 4 weeks. I think it would be safe to say, though, that the majority of our wells this year were in the Wolfcamp A. You can see we're still trying to delineate it quite a bit. And I would expect the vast majority of the wells in 2015 prior, while we're still in delineation mode across that acreage position, are going to be in the Wolfcamp A as well. Once we get it delineated, we can start developing that. Build up the cash flow from that investment set and then start delineating the zones below it.
James E. Craddock
Having said that, I mean, John pointed out earlier a Bone Springs test that's on the books for us that's in that kind of east area, the structural nose area. That's going to happen. I would say, this year is not a bad example for what next year will look like. We did mostly Wolfcamp A, and we had maybe 1 in each of the other -- or in 2 of the other benches, and you can expect something like that for next year. And then keep in mind that we have a good situation, in that, we have very strong operators around us, folks that we respect, that are doing testing as well. And we would fully expect to see some tests in some of those other benches in and around our acreage from some of those other operators as well. So we'll get data and we have the luxury of time as well, as John has mentioned, we're holding the acreage with the wells that we're doing.
Daniel D. Guffey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Okay, great. I guess in the third quarter, well costs in the Wolfcamp were around $9 million, you mentioned, and that was 1,200 pounds per lateral foot. As you move to 1,500 pounds and 1,800 pounds, do you guys have an updated AFE you could provide?
John D. Clayton
Yes, we'll probably disclose a little more than that next month or next time we talk when we roll out the capital budget to get in the granularity of it. Sand is cheap. It's about -- I think we talked about this when we talked about the Eagle Ford, it's 1/4 of the cost of ceramic. And we don't pump ceramic anymore in the Eagle Ford, and I know we're talking about the Permian, but the incremental cost of that is not a whole lot when you look at it. So we'll disclose more color on that the next time we meet.
