John Levy
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we review the final quarter of whatâs been a momentous and transformative year for theScore. Itâs of course set against the backdrop, the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related math disruption to sports. Fiscal 2020 began with the historic launch of our gaming operations. theScore Bet went live in New Jersey just over a year ago.
The viewing our best-in-class mobile sports book and our unique approach diffusing media with gaming. This early momentum was however abruptly halted with the suspension of all professional sports in early spring due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Through the hard work of our team, we were able to successfully navigate this period, reserving our media user base through the innovative content offerings and continuing work on key product development priority to prepare for the successful resumption of sports and our on-time multi-state rollout of theScore Bet.
This approach has left us in a position of strength. We now look forward to an exciting new fiscal year. Just last month, we successfully began the multi-state expansion of theScore Bet launching in both Colorado and Indiana within two weeks of each other. This is a huge accomplishment, which included the debut of our cutting edge multi-state infrastructure. This technology underpins our ability to expand across North America through a single mobile app, providing a truly seamless experience for our users.
Now live in three States. We plan on launching theScore Bet next in Iowa, early in the new calendar year subject of course, to regulatory approval with other States to follow. Iowa will also be the second state launched under our multi-state market access framework agreement with Penn National Gaming. Early momentum in both Colorado and Indiana have been very exciting. The fans eager to experience our unique approach of the integration of media with gaming.
We continue to expand. We remain focused on building cost-effective and sustainable user growth by leveraging the power of our media audience complimented by smart and strategic promotional offers in each of the markets we entered. This quarter, we also made strides to expand our offering, securing market access for online casino in New Jersey through an agreement with the Twin River Worldwide Holdings.
We will continue to explore additional market access opportunity as sports betting and iGaming markets expand across North America, including we believe here in Canada in the not-too-distant future. We continue to closely monitor the regulatory landscape in Canada, and weâll be prepared to launch theScore Bet in our own backyard as and when the opportunity arises.
Furthermore, we also graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange from the TSX Venture Exchange. This was a natural part of our continued growth and evolution and further raises the profile of our growing leadership position in North America sports, media, e-sports and gaming. Towards the end of Q4, we began to see major sports leagues resume play.
While 2020 was a significantly impacted by the cancellation or postponement of major sports events and leagues with the recent return of sports, our media and gaming operations have picked up right where they left off. In September, total handle on the theScore Bet grew by more than 500% year-over-year, that momentum was had carried into October and also extends into our media operations. Weâre advertising sales in September set an all new, all time record for a single month.
In Q4, we were successful in preserving 83% of our media app audience achieving 70 average sessions per user per month versus 75 for the same period last year. Through the early fall, we have seen user numbers and engagement snapped back to the pre-COVID level as we got deeper and deeper into a very busy and exciting sports calendar. It was also a new record quarter for e-sports programming. This continued growth and our established leadership position in our coverage of the competitive gaming scene has resulted in more and more brands seeking to activate against this hugely compelling content.
theScore is in a strongly position to continue this momentum across both our media and gaming platforms. And weâre extremely excited by the strong start to fiscal 2021. Core to our focus will be our continued approach to leveraging the powerful combination of media and gaming something we are doubling down on with the launch of new enhancements to our media app in the coming weeks, bringing our sports app audience even closer to the betting experience.
Before I turn things over to Benjie to speak about our product and content initiatives in further detail, I want to first take this moment to formally welcome the latest addition to our Board of Directors. Angela Ruggiero is a sports business leader and four-time Olympian who joined our Board earlier this month and weâre thrilled to welcome her to our team. Angela comes to us with a wide range of sports experience. Having served as an advocate, an entrepreneur, author, brand ambassador, investor, motivational speaker, and podcaster, she currently is the CEO and Co-Founder of Sports Innovation Lab, a technology powered market research firm focused on the intersection of sports and innovation with the aim of identifying trends that evaluating technology products and services that will drive the future of sport. We welcome Angela to our team.
Now over to Benjie.
Benjie Levy
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our product development work in Q4 focused on our final preparations for the multi-state expansion of theScore Bet, including the completion of our multi-state wallet and account functionality and our single app infrastructure, which enables users of theScore Bet to travel from state to state using a single mobile app.
In early September, we successfully launched theScore Bet in Colorado and Indiana. This dual launch with two States in two weeks is a huge technical accomplishment that showcases our speed to market proficiency as we move into new States.
Moving forward into Q1, we will build on our early traction in these States with a number of new innovative product features that will deepen the connection between our media and gaming platforms and we look forward to unveiling some of these features to our users in the coming weeks. We are also preparing for our Iowa launch early in the New Year and have started work on our integrated online casino offering for New Jersey, which we anticipate launching later in calendar 2021, all subject to regulatory approval.
Finally, I would be remiss without a shout out to our amazing team for some of the industry recognition that our unique innovative approach to sports betting has started to garner. In particular, we won best online mobile sports betting experience at the Cynopsis Sports Media Awards in August and have also been named finalists for best product innovation and U.S. Rising Star at the EGR Awards, as well as finalists for Best Mobile Operator App and Rising Star in Sports Betting at the SBC Awards.
This recognition is a testament to the hardworking creativity of our team in developing our mobile sports betting platform, helping us to stand out in such a highly competitive space. On our media platform, in Q4, average monthly active users on theScore continue to strengthen reaching 3 million or 83% of our audience from the same period in the prior year. This was not just the result of a busy sports calendar later in the quarter, but also our teamâs tireless efforts to keep users engaged and retained throughout the spring and summer prior to the resumption of sports.
These efforts included new content formats, like, interactive brackets and competitions that leverage our social reach to connect with new users and to drive existing users back to our app. As John noted earlier, this work to retain our users over the past six months is now paying dividends as we head into the fall with users and engagement on our sports app snapping back to pre-COVID levels in tandem with the return of major sports leagues.
Likewise, advertising budgets have also begun to return leading to an all time record for ad sales in a single month in September. Our social sports content across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok achieved an average monthly reach of approximately 103 million sports fans in Q4. On TikTok in particular, we continue to see tremendous growth, where we added 576,000 followers during the quarter with our audience now exceeding 2.4 million. Our reaching influence across social channels continues to serve as both a powerful brand builder, as well as the growing monetization channel.
In Q4, we completed our first ever brand integration on TikTok with epic games, as well as a sponsored social content activation with the insurance company on layup. At the same time, we were seeing success in our recently launched sports YouTube channel with videos now regularly reaching fixed figure viewership.
Turning to esports, in Q4, we set another all-time quarterly record with 292 million video views on our e-sports platforms, representing year-over-year growth of 243% and subscribers to our channel now exceeding 1.5 million. In addition, our esports TikTok channel is showing powerful growth, adding 641,000 followers in Q4, now exceeding 1 million followers. As our esports channel and profile continues to rise, we are seeing exciting momentum around sponsored activations with big brands and publishers eager to align with our popular content. In Q4, we secured deals with Mastercard, Riot Games and gaming equipment provider Razer. Weâre excited about the monetization prospects in this space as esports continues in significant global growth.
Iâll now turn things over to Alvin, who will take a closer look at our financial results.
Alvin Lobo
Thanks, Benjie. Before I provide a financial recap, when we take a moment to highlight some key developments in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we both serve our balance sheet by closing our previously announced $25 million bought deal offering in August, including the overwhelming. We issued an aggregate of 39.5 million Class A shares raising gross proceeds of $25.6 million. In July, we entered into $6.25 million revolving term credit facility with the same Canadian chartered banks that maintains our $5 million revolving credit facility, supported by the Export Development Corporationâs, business credit availability program.
We completed a drawdown of the $6.25 million under this new revolving term credit facility in July. And as John mentioned, in September, we graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange from the TSX Venture Exchange and commenced trading on the TSX on September 15 under our existing ticker SCR.
Now for the financial recap of the quarter. Total revenue for Q4 fiscal 2020 was $2.5 million compared to $6.4 million for the same period last year. While total revenue for the 12 months ended August 31 was $20.7 million compared to $31.1 million for the same period last year. This anticipated decline in revenue for the period reflects the direct impact of the disruption of the sports calendar caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gaming handle was $14.8 million in Q4 fiscal 2020 and $41.5 million for the 12 months ended August 31. Gross gaming revenue was negative $0.5 million in Q4 and $253,000 for the 12 months ended August 31. When taking into account promotional costs and fair value adjustments on unsettled bets, this resulted in net gaming revenue of negative $1.2 million and negative $1.4 million for the three and 12 months ended August 31 respectively.
EBITDA loss in Q4 fiscal 2020 was $8.3 million versus an EBITDA loss of $4.1 million for the same period of last year. EBITDA loss for the 12 months ended August 31 was $30.5 million versus an EBITDA loss of $6.5 million in the same period last year. The increase in EBITDA loss was primarily due to the COVID related impact on revenue for the period and the result of additional expenses incurred in connection with the expansion of our gaming operations compared to the prior year. From a liquidity perspective, we ended the fiscal year with cash of $40.1 million in our $5 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn. James?
James Bigg
Thanks, Alvin. That concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator, we will now open the floor to questions from analysts.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suthan Sukumar from Eight Capital. Your line is open,
Suthan Sukumar
Good afternoon guys and a snap back here in some of these key business metrics. Hey guys. My first question is here. I guess, on the â starting with the media side, on the content strategy with sports now back on. Do you guys anticipate kind of a pivot back to your pre-pandemic content strategy or do you guys envision a more custom strategy going forward. But Iâm curious what type of feedback and interest youâve been seeing from advertisers on this realized strategy.
John Levy
Thanks, Suthan. Maybe Iâll just start. I mean, really the strategy has remained the same, obviously with, during the pandemic, less engagement with respect to no box Scores, prior to sports coming back. So we leaned in heavily to our content team, who did an amazing job digging up stories and continuing to sort of engage our user base and thatâs why we were able to sustain basically about 80% or 85% of the user base on the app. With sports coming back, it was really interesting, because we were kind into this flood of sports, I mean, we â like, weâve never sort of experienced before. It was kind of March madness for hockey, basketball, football showed up, NCAA showed up. I mean, it was a plethora of thing.
So our content team really sort of snapped back to sort of pre-COVID moments and weâre starting to cover all of these sports simultaneously. So weâve had to be pretty adaptive, but really at the core of it, there hasnât been much change. I mean, weâd already sort of moved into providing more content towards our betting, the betting universe. Thatâs been happening gradually over the course of the last year.
So to the user, it was really business as usual in the context of how we were able to respond. And quite frankly, we got to continue to be creative. As you can see, hockeyâs done, basketballâs done. And down during the week, weâve got some soccer and weâve got some other international soccer and MLS soccer, but itâs been delve pretty quickly to heavy on the weekends, big on football nights.
So our guys have been pretty adaptive, and â but they can bring stories up regardless of whatâs going on and Iâve done so during the whole period. So the important point I think Suthan was the brand is loved and recognized by people, who are use the app and nothing happening during this whole period. They snapped back, they came back and Iâm not surprised, but it was always great to see the enthusiasm that we got once it came back. And thatâs on the media side, same thing, obviously on the betting front.
Suthan Sukumar
Great, thatâs helpful. So as you guys called out record ad sales in September. Iâm curious here, what does that â is that a function of kind of more advertisers coming to the table or a greater share of wallet with some of the existing advertisers?
John Levy
I think itâs a combination of all of that. Thereâs â just like there was pent up demand on our front. There was pent up demand on the buying front. They were waiting for sports to come back. And I also got to give credit to our sales guys. It would have been very easy for them just hunker down and say, oh, crap, thereâs nothing going on. And they work to fall and they stayed on with the agencies. They stayed on with the clients directly. We didnât lose many of â hardly any of those advertisers, either directly or indirectly.
And it was all about repositioning, at the time, hoping and praying the sports is going to come back and in fact, they did. So a lot of this was dollars that probably would have been spent during the usual course, but that got parked and were brought back, because of the hard work of our guys.
Plus, as I mentioned earlier, there was a whole whack of sports going on simultaneously. The guys, these advertisers were tripping honestly shower themselves to secure product in the NBA and baseball and hockey. And whatâs really interesting. I mean, we just had sales meeting today. The same thing is being experienced now. Even though, thereâs a great deal of uncertainty as to, when is it hockey coming back and when is the NBA coming back and is NCAA basketball, when is that starting? You could already see it with our advertisers that are winding up getting ready to take lead positions in these leagues, when theyâre resurfacing.
So credit to our guys in keeping the advertisers hot and anxious, the credit to our content guys and our data guys for keeping the app in as greater shape as possible. And it resulted in, weâre not going to be specific, but we do â weâre talking about pretty significant numbers through the early fall.
Suthan Sukumar
Okay, great. Can you just â and then moving on to the sports betting, I think the 500% year-over-year growth and betting handle is obviously quite impressive. Can you speak on the impact of your bonusing and promotions initiatives in New Jersey since the rollout? I think you guys rolled that out just in time for it to start the NFL season. Iâm curious, what trends are you seeing at the quality of the end user level?
John Levy
Benjie, you want to take that?
Benjie Levy
Sure. Thanks, Suthan. Yes, listen, I think what weâre seeing with some of the bonusing and promotions, like, we talked about we rolled out to new cash back functionality. Weâre presenting bonusing and kind of in a structure and terminology, thatâs very kind of user friendly and easy to understand, which contrast with a lot of kind of bonusing initiatives in the sports betting space. And kind of combining that with some type of upfront free bet or bet insurance offerings.
Generally, the feedback weâre getting from our users is that itâs resonating well, in terms of user onboarding, in terms of user retention and ongoing handle. Weâre pretty happy with how the promotions that we used around kind of return to sports have been and we continue to tweak them and keep things fresh for our users moving forward. But in general, weâve been happy with that. And with those promotions as they â which we also rolled out to new users as we were launching in Colorado and Indiana.
Suthan Sukumar
Good. Great. Can you guys touch on some of the early dayâs progress that you guys are making in Colorado and Indiana? How is this compared to what youâve seen in New Jersey currently, with respect to competitive intensity or play behavior so forth?
Benjie Levy
I think, itâs no surprise, New Jersey is the most competitively intense market in the country from a sports betting perspective. We launched in New Jersey about 12 or 13 months after the market initially opened. Weâre much closer to market open in Colorado and Indiana. But kind of regardless of all of that, I think our playbook remains the same, regardless of where weâre operating. Weâre led by our media platform and our media app. That is our primary source of user acquisition and is our back source of ongoing user engagement and user retention.
And I teased out in my remarks a little bit earlier, some of the new product features that youâre going to start to see as we more deeply integrate media and betting that are going to be coming out in the coming weeks, that build on top of what we launched initially last year with fuse. Weâre pretty excited to roll that out. We canât wait to show that to our users and to you guys, in over that period of time. But all in all, weâre pretty positive about how things have been going.
Suthan Sukumar
Okay. Okay, good. And then guys just last one for me, on the iGaming front, whatâs the go-to-market plan here? The plans kind of roll it up a standalone versus an integrated app. Were you guys looking at partners and what would be colored the initial scope of offerings when you do go-to-market?
John Levy
Weâre early days in our planning, but for us, itâs always about â itâs about it being an integrated approach. Our desire is not to launch a standalone high gaming platform. Itâs about leveraging, the strong cross sell between sports betting and iGaming. I mean, you see other research or other participants in the market who talk about a cross sell between anywhere from 25% to 40% of sports betting players crossing into iGaming. iGaming for a â that type of built for a sports betting audience in mind is going to have a different mix of games, more focused on table games and slots catering to that kind of core sports betting demographic, which differs a little bit from the broader online casino demographic.
But I think thatâs the angle and approach that youâll see at hey is that this all comes back to how do we present our sports fans, our media app users with the broadest possible gaming offering thatâs relevant to them. Just like we wouldnât have without our core media app, we werenât getting into the sports betting business, weâre not â we wouldnât just be launching into online gaming. Itâs all part of an integrated offering and an integrated approach.
Suthan Sukumar
Right. Okay, great. And can you remind us again on the anticipated timing for the launch iGaming?
John Levy
Yes. The timing we talked about was kind of second half of calendar 2021.
Suthan Sukumar
Okay. Okay. Thatâs it for me. Iâll pass the line and hop back into the queue. Thank you.
John Levy
Thanks, Suthan.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David McFadgen from Cormark Securities. Your line is open.
David McFadgen
So just a couple of questions. So maybe just start on a New Jersey market share. So it looks like your market share for your fourth quarter was around 1.4% of the [indiscernible] New Jersey. And based on what youâre saying for September, it was up over 500%. It looks like, itâs tracking like 1.5% or maybe a bit higher. I was wondering, does that make sense to you?
John Levy
Whoâs responding? Benjie?
Benjie Levy
Yes. I think thatâs not inconsistent with what weâre seeing David.
David McFadgen
Okay. And how are things like â how would you characterize your launch right now in Indiana and Colorado? Like howâs it going and how would it compare to your early days in New Jersey?
Benjie Levy
I think â yes, itâs a little bit different in that, weâre a year further along the product is further advanced. Our promotional capabilities are a little bit further advanced than they were when we launched in New Jersey. But as I kind of sit with Suthan, itâs early days, weâre a month in, weâre happy with how weâve been tracking from a user perspective and a handle perspective. And the user seem to be responding well to the offering and the users weâre getting on the platform are engaging and retaining as weâve seen them do in New Jersey.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. I mean I know itâsâ¦
Benjie Levy
So far so good.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, good. I know itâs early days in Indiana and Colorado, but I donât know if you can comment about this, but do you think that your success in those markets might be better than New Jersey just given your more advanced when you launched into those markets.
Benjie Levy
I donât think Iâd want to characterize it as being better or worse. I think itâs the playbook in those markets for us is the same. And itâs about attacking the market with our integrated approach and supplementing that with some paid marketing. So I think I wouldnât get into characterizing separately how users or how weâre doing in one market versus another at this point.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then just so obviously we see in the numbers that there was some negative GGR and while the corresponding GGR was negative in the fourth quarter. Itâs been negative for a couple quarters. Are you happy with the management of the sports book, or do you think you can maybe switch that up and get some better results?
John Levy
Let me take that one. Itâs really all just about the lumpiness of what we experienced when youâve got the sort of low volumes that we were starting with. And the answer is no, weâre very happy with our risk and trading team. Theyâre doing a great job. And when we start to dissect, whatâs happening on a state by state basis and a sport by sport basis, theyâre responding very well. And itâs â David, itâs really no more or less than just lumpy action, when youâre â when youâve got the sort of volumes that we have right now. Weâre not unhappy with the volumes right now, but weâve always said that weâre building the momentum and weâre getting the users, the betters, and theyâre staying with us.
And obviously, itâs been working diligently with new promotions and trying to â try to increase handle on a per user basis. I mean thereâs a million things that weâre working on right now in the context of the day to day, week to week marketing and operations. But in terms of that, no, weâre not concerned about that. And once we get up to more significant volumes and weâre only talking about now one state thatâs been on for awhile, one state has been less than a month, and when the numbers start to go where we know theyâre going to go.
Weâre fully confident weâre going to be in the range that we always talked about, which is typical of what percentage of handle weâre expecting to grab. In the same time, weâre trying to be as responsible as we can in terms of our how are the cost of acquisition, which is what we always talk about. So no, we want more betters and we want more better betters, and we want them bedding to the heartâs content. And we believe that weâre well armed to end up getting the profitability that, that sports books â the sports books should maintain. And in fact, in our particular case, once we really get rolling, we think weâre going to be at the higher end of the ranges that we talk about.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, okay. So maybe just a question on the media business and you talked about September was a quarter â with a record in terms media revenue, the ad revenue. So I guess, would it be safe to assume that your Q1 is going to be up year-over-year versus the prior year?
Benjie Levy
I donât know that we guide, but I think what weâve said is that value is effort, David, but yes, listen September was strong. And weâre seeing that momentum continue. So listen advertising revenue coming into the fall is trending positively. There is no doubt about that, but I wouldnât want to say more in specifically characterize.
John Levy
But not to throw water on all the excitement about it, because I know thatâs not what I typically do, but Hockey is over, Basketball is over. And when youâre comparing sort week over week from year to year, itâs impossible to make those comparisons anymore, right, because you donât have the same inventory of sports programming on a day-to-day basis. Whatâs exciting to us is what weâve seen weâve achieved and what we see actually happening, as I said earlier in earlier remarks about advertisers lining up to make sure that theyâre there, David, itâs not certain that theyâre right now, but just planning.
When did Basketball coming back, we heard about perhaps early mid-December, right. I think thatâs the latest that theyâve announced. When Hockey coming back? We havenât really heard. But what I do know is our advertisers who normally would be spending like crazy, have a say in November and December and Hockey or Basketball are lining up to support that when Basketball comes back. So again, itâs weird times because of the nature of the sport, but what weâre seeing is a very, very active market and huge pent-up demand for these advertisers directly and indirectly wanting to make sure that that theyâre participating with us.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. All right. Thatâs it for me. Thanks.
John Levy
Great.
Benjie Levy
Thanks, David.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Rob Goff from Echelon. Your line is open.
Rob Goff
Thank you for taking my question. If you go back to the advertisement again for the month of September, could you talk to some of the structural changes perhaps within that figure in terms of was it direct selling sales? Was it programmatic? And I understand what the sports lineup was a unique month. Could you talk to how yields might have compared given past levels?
Benjie Levy
Yes, I think Rob, the biggest sources of strength in September, weâre in the direct sales group, no question on both sides of the border. And I wouldnât say thereâs been necessarily material changes in yield. I mean weâve always done very well at selling our inventory, particularly in the U.S., you probably will see a bit of a shift from programmatic into direct on the U.S. side of the border and in Canada, itâs a more integrations, and also starting to leverage our social channels a little bit more actively, and also with some, as weâve talked about some dedicated e-sports sales as well. So really a combination across the board of a large number of advertisers coming, lots of integrations and kind of strong sales on both sides of the border.
Rob Goff
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Again your next question comes from the line of Suthan Sukumar from Eight Capital. Your line is open.
Suthan Sukumar
Hey guys, just a few follow-up questions from me. Can you speak a little bit more about the changes that are being played, that are being planned for the media app? Is it more integrations into betting or other types of fundamental feature enhancements to the media experience?
Benjie Levy
I donât want to tease too much Suthan, but I think itâs some of the â what weâre specifically talking about over the course of the next â over the next couple of weeks are related to media and gaming integrations more specifically. So thereâs a robust media product roadmap in its own right. But what weâre talking about here is some new enhancements in integrations.
Suthan Sukumar
Right, okay. Got it. And on the sports going front, and you guys mentioned Iowa as your next launch market. Iâm curious, whatâs next in view? I think a couple other States like Michigan and Massachusetts are making some significant progress on the regulatory front. I think you guys do have a market access secured in those States. Whatâs kind of the next priority list for you guys beyond Iowa?
Benjie Levy
Yes. Obviously, I think youâre right. I think in general, what weâre seeing is a lot of activity on the regulatory side. Massachusetts is very active. Ohio where we have market access with 10 is also very active. Some States like Arizona are starting to bubble up. So the beauty about the work that weâve done over the past year to create our multi-state infrastructure is it allows us to deploy in markets very, very quickly once those markets open.
So itâs going to depend in part on how the regulatory environment unfolds, how these States legalize, how quickly they open. But weâre very well equipped to capitalize on opportunities with not a significant degree of development or technical effort. And then as John said, the other interesting element that looms large is what happens up here in Ontario, where our expectation and hope is that sooner than later, this market is going to open for both sports betting and iGaming. And so weâre â we have an eye very, very closely on whatâs going on here as well.

Okay, great. Thanks. Thatâs helpful. And the last one from me guys that obviously in the space is a lot of noise and chatter about partnerships and M&A. What do you guys see as a natural of next partnership for theScore and what do we expect in the near-term? Is it along the lines of more market access agreement type partnerships or potentially something more strategic?
Benjie Levy
I think for us, itâs about how do we grow our footprint across the U.S., as well as what opportunities may exist in Canada. We have a great market access footprint already. Obviously weâre going to look to expand that to capture more States. Yes, and then as weâve always said, to the extent there are opportunities on the strategic side that help us advance our business quite frankly, whether thatâs on the media side or on the bedding side, weâre always open to things that, weâll help either advance our footprint or improve our customer experience.
