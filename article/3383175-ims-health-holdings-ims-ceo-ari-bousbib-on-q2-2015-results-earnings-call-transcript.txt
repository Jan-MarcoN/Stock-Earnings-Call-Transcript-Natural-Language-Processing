Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the IMS Health Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Friday, July 31, 2015.
Now, I would like to turn the conference over to the Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Kinsley
Thank you and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us to discuss IMS Health's second quarter 2015 performance. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our Investor Relations website. The Investor Relations website is easily found in the top right-hand corner of our company's website imshealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, July 31, 2015.
Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are in fact achieved will depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
During this presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and unlevered free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material, non-cash, unusual or non-recurring items, and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.
These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
And now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings call. The second quarter is our first opportunity to report our results including the acquisition of Cegedim's CRM and Strategic Data businesses. We will refer to these acquired business as the Cegedim Acquisition for simplicity for the remainder of the call.
Well, this was a very busy quarter. First we've closed the Cegedim Acquisition. Second, we begun the hard work associated with the integration process. And third, we launched and successfully close $1.6 billion secondary offering, combined with a $300 million shares repurchase in May. Importantly we delivered on the second quarter guidance, which we provided to you on our last earnings call.
For the quarter, revenue grew about 25% at constant currency, technology services was up 46% and information revenue grew 9.4%, adjusted EBITDA growth was 9.5% at constant currency. Excluding the impact of the Cegedim acquisition, revenue grew 5.2% at constant currency, driven by growth in technology services of just under 12% as real-world evidence and technology and applications continues to perform very well.
Information offerings grew by 0.5 point, emerging markets revenue increase 29.4% and develop markets grew 23.5% before the impact of FX. The comparable numbers before the impact of Cegedim were just under 9% for emerging markets, and 4.4% for develop markets.
Although currency stabilize during the quarter FX continues to affect our compressions to prior year because of the strengthening of the dollar in the second half of 2014 and first quarter of this year. Ron, will discuss this effects impact in greater detail in his remarks.
Now, let me share some notable wins and add some color to the Cegedim integration and the work we've had during the quarter. A top five global pharma clients signed a deal to rollout our Nexxus social media application globally. This is the multi-million dollar deal that extends our technology relationship with this global client. They already use Nexxus performance, our performance management application. They are on mobile intelligence CRM and they also use the Nucleus 360 MDM platform that came from Cegedim throughout Europe and part of Asia.
Now having Nexxus social media helps our clients to replace their current manual processes of tracking adverse events with an automated solution. Another important win in our Real-World Evidence business, we signed a deal multi-years, multi-million dollars with another top five pharma client. This client will be extending their technology capabilities, gaining broader access to anonymous patient beta assets and receiving scientific expertise from our team on demand.
Our Clinical Trials business closed a deal with the top 10 CRO to deploy our Clinical Trial enrollment optimization solution Study Optimizer. They will use the tool to plan and manage enrollment for 100s of clinical trials globally each year. Now a couple of words about the Cegedim deal. You know that we have been very busy working on the Cegedim integration during the quarter. By the way, I'd like to thank our finance team around the world for outstanding job. I'm sure you all appreciate the timing of this call within one month of the quarter end. This is standard practice for IMS but Cegedim usually report it much later. So it was a lot of strain on the organization to get this done and it was a great job all around.
As I told you on our last call, 2015 is going to be a very â a year of heavy lifting and a lot of hard work associated with integrating the Cegedim acquisition. From day one we started operating as one team, reorganizing other common management structures for all of our functions, business units as well as IT and production facilities.
As a reminder, we expect to realize a $50 million run rate synergies now by the end of 2017. This year we are in transition, conducting consultations with works councils and overseas jurisdictions, renegotiating contract and executing on various other rationalization activities. There's a lot of noise for the balance of the year, but we remain very excited about the benefits of the acquisition which we'll begin to approve in 2016.
One of the more exciting areas for integration is our go-to-market strategy. Operating as one organization we are already seeing the benefits of combining our technology offerings and are bringing to market innovative solutions for example multi-channel marketing, MCM and for master data management, MDM. These are areas where clients are looking to us as an end-to-end provider rather than going to multiple vendors, who struggle with implementing integrated solutions. For example, we just closed a significant Pan-European contract in MCM with top U.S. oncology firm.
We won a multi-country engagement with the top-ten pharma company for our organization manager application, which [indiscernible] helps with CF planning and realignment. We have several significant MDM engagements ongoing with top 20 pharma clients in Europe and in the U.S. And if we look at the traditional CRM space, we have a number of significant wins as well.
Notably, we won a multi-year contract for mobile intelligence with top generics company, which will add over 4,000 seats. We won an important European deal with valiance. We won a five year 25 country mobile intelligent deal with European mid-size pharma company, which will add another few thousand seats. And we won several notable other country specific deals for MI with local affiliates of large and medium size pharma clients.
All-in-all, the integration is on track and we really like the reaction of our clients and the progress we are making with them. Now, before I turn it over to Ron, I want to take this opportunity to welcome our new investors, who participated in our successful secondary offering on May 4. I'd also like to thank our existing investors for their strong support and also for their increased participation during the offering.
And with that, let me turn it over to Ron, our Senior Vice President and CFO to take you through the financials in more detail.
Ronald Bruehlman
Thanks, Ari and good morning everyone. And as Ari mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting results in line â excuse me â including the Cegedim acquisition and those results were in line with our guidance and let's review the results. First off, revenue in the second quarter increased 24.6% on a constant currency basis and this included a deferred revenue adjustment related to the Cegedim acquisition and excluding this adjustment revenue growth was about 25%.
Technology services offerings grew 45.6% and information offerings were up 9.4% again at constant currency and including the revenue from the Cegedim acquisition technology services revenue comprised almost half of our total revenue in the second quarter, which is an important milestone for this faster growing portion of our business. Now obviously these growth rates were significantly enhanced by the Cegedim acquisition. So excluding this impact of overall constant currency revenue growth was 5.2% and technology services offerings again were the main driver expanding just shy of 12% with particularly strong growth and real world evidence in technology and applications. And on the same basis, that is a constant currency and excluding Cegedim, information offerings grew by half-a-point.
Now you remember on last quarter's call, we told you that revenue growth which was 7% in Q1 would not be quite as strong in Q2 because certain deals closed early. So for the first half, we averaged out to just over 6% growth. On a reported basis that is at actual FX rates overall revenue grew 12% in the quarter with technology services revenue growing 33.3% and information revenue declines 3.2%, excluding Cegedim reported revenue declined4.6% with technology services growing 3.8% and information declining 10.7%.
Turning now to the geographies, looking at developed versus emerging markets. Developed markets grew 23.5%, emerging markets about 29% during the quarter. Excluding the Cegedim acquisition, developed markets grew 4.4% and emerging markets almost 9%.
Growth in China was encouraging at 20%. At actual currency rates, developed markets grew 12.7% and emerging markets 8.8% during the quarter. For core IMS, developed markets revenue declined 4% and emerging markets declined 7.5%.
Okay, turning now to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was 220 million for the quarter, increasing 9.5% constant currency and declining 2.3% reported. Now as you'd expect our EBITDA margin was diluted in the quarter by the lower profitability of Cegedim, with Q2 margin declining little more than four percentage points. However, as we've been saying this one of the reason we loved this deal, because it provides ample runway for margin improvement.
Moving down the P&L, GAAP net income was $47 million during Q2 compared with a net loss of $220 million last year and this comparison was affected by substantial one-time charges in last year's second quarter due to our IPO, the related debt recapitalization and the Venezuelan Bolivar revaluation.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.14 in the second quarter compared with the diluted loss per share of $0.67 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income was up 3.9% on a constant currency basis due to the growth in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash taxes as cash taxes were unusually low than last year's second quarter, and this year of course includes taxes paid by the acquired Cegedim entity.
On a reported basis second quarter adjusted net income was $125 million, down 6.3% due to the impact of FX on adjusted EBITDA and also the higher cash taxes. Adjusted net income included an $8 million benefit from foreign royalty hedges and a natural earnings hedge provided by our Euro denominated debt.
Cash taxes, net of refunds during the quarter totaled $24 million or about 16% of pre-tax cash income. Now we previously told you to expect our cash tax rate to average in the high teens in the mid 2019 before converging with our book tax rate. The reason is that we expected to have no material U.S. tax payments until 2019 due to accumulated net operating loss carry forwards and unutilized foreign tax credits. Due to the Cegedim acquisition and other changes in our tax position, we're updating that guidance.
We now expect our cash tax rate to continue in the high teens for an additional two years that is into mid 2021. Again, the reason is that we do not expect to have any material U.S. tax payments until then. Of course, this is based on what we know today and could change if circumstances change, for instance due to additional large acquisitions. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second quarter was $0.37 compared with $0.39 in 2014.
Turning to the year to-date results, first half revenue was $1.37 billion representing an increase of about 16% constant currency. Technology services offerings grew 29.5% and information offerings were up 6.2%, again at constant currency. Now excluding the impact of the Cegedim acquisition which of course affected only the second quarter, a constant currency revenue growth was 6.1% in the first half with technology services offerings expanding 12.2%. And information grew by 1.8% on the same basis over the six months.
On a reported basis, our revenue grew 5.1% in the first half with tech services up 19.6% and information declining 5.1%. At constant currency, developed markets grew 49.9%, emerging markets grew 20.6% during the first half, the same number excluding the Cegedim acquisition were 5.3% for developed markets and an even 10% for emerging markets. Now at actual currency rates, obviously those results were developed. The emerging markets were a little bit lower as shown.
On the year-to-date P&L, adjusted EBITDA for the first half was 436 million, down 1.5% reported and not 9.7% at constant currency. Adjusted net income for the first half of 261 million increased 28.2% reported and 42% constant surgery and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.76 in the first half were up 17.4% at actual rates and 30% at constant currency.
Okay, let's move to the balance sheet. As you know we funded a portion of the Cegedim transaction with debt. Specifically, â¬275 million of eight-year senior notes through 2023 which carry a very attractive 4.125% coupon. In conjunction with our secondary offering in May, we executed a $300 million share repurchase, which reduced our shares outstanding by 11 million and just to do some math for you, this lowered the weighted average shares outstanding for the second quarter by about 3 million shares and will lower the full year weighted average shares outstanding by about 7 million shares. We funded the share repurchase with $200 million of borrowings from our existing term loan a facility and a $100 million draw against our existing revolving yesterday facility now during the course of the half, we also repaid $113 million of debt.
At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled 348 million in debt was 4.2 billion resulting in net debt of 3.9 billion. Our gross leverage ratio increased to 4.8 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA compared to 4.6 times last year.
And now of course this takes into account only one quarter of Cegedim adjusted EBITDA contribution. So, we expect this ratio to decline as we advance through the year and accumulate more quarters at Cegedim's contribution to EBITDA, of course, all else being equal.
Cash flow from operations increased by 311 million to 185 million during the second quarter compared to net cash used of 126 million in the second quarter of last year and unleveraged free cash flow of -- for the second quarter was strong at 219 million, an increase of 30 million over last year and this represents a drop through of 100% of adjusted EBITDA.
Now, let's turn now to the guidance. As we said in our release, we're reaffirming our full year guidance on all key metrics both on a constant currency and a reported basis. Since you don't have a history with the quarterly phasing to the Cegedim acquisition, we're going to give you a little extra help again this quarter by providing a third quarter guidance.
For the third quarter on a constant currency basis, we're projecting 23 to 24% revenue growth. 7.5 to 8.5% adjusted EBITDA growth; we expected adjusted net income to decline by 1 to 2% and adjusted EPS growth to be flat reflecting higher cash taxes as well as a higher interest expense from our incremental debt. For the third quarter on a reported basis, that is assuming exchange rates remain constant for the balance of the year, we're expecting revenue growth of 13 to 14%, a decline in adjusted EBITDA of 2 to 3%, decline of adjusted net income of 12 to 14% and a decline in adjusted diluted EPS of 10 to 12%.
Okay, on full year basis, constant currency, we're reaffirming growth of 19 to 20% in revenue, 13 to 14% in adjusted EBITDA, 20 to 23% adjusted net income and 15 to 18% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Looking at the same guidance numbers on a reported basis, that is actual currency rates assuming foreign currency rates remain constant for the balance of the year, we're reaffirming revenue growth of about 10% adjusted EBITDA growth of about 4%, 8 to 11% growth in adjusted net income and 4 to 8% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. And when I say about, I mean, you could see a swing of a half a point or so either way.
Now some quick math will tell you that we're projecting much stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter than the third quarter and there are a couple of reasons for this. First, the fourth quarter is historically been Cegedim a strongest quarter. Second, we're increasing our investment spend on new data sources such as specialty data, railroad evidence set, and new data for new offerings around the world and these year-over-year increases are most heavily weighted towards the second and the third quarters of this year. Our unlevered free cash flow we continue to expect the combined company to be between 70% and 80% of adjusted EBITDA.
So, in summary, we had a very busy and successful quarter. We closed the Cegedim acquisition at the beginning of April. We completed a secondary offering that included a $300 million share repurchase in May and we ended the quarter by delivering on our second quarter guidance.
The core IMS business continues to perform with great consistency including our 8th consecutive quarter of double-digit technology services revenue growth at constant currency.
We have combined the operations and organizations of IMS and Cegedim under one management structure. We're already seeing the benefits in our selling efforts. Now it's going to take a few quarters to begin realizing the $50 million of cost synergies but we're more confidence than ever about achieving them. So look forward to continuing the margin expansion stories that has been the hallmark of IMS since the LBL.
Finally, our balance sheet remains in great shape. We continue to generate strong cash flow and this provides ample flexibility to invest for growth. We feel good about the balance of the year and we're now planning for 2016 which we believe will be even more exciting than 2015.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Absolute, thank you very much. [Operator Instruction].
Tom Kinsley
Excuse me, operator, you said 1 followed by a 3 and then you said 1 followed by a 4. Can you please clarify?
Operator
No, I did mention it. It's is the 1 followed by the 4 to register a question. Very good. Once again, it's the 1-4 to ask a question. One moment please for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank. Go right ahead.
Paul Ginocchio
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all the color on the contract wins. It sounds like the strategies, you're actually doing the strategy well. Just on all the deal flow that we're hearing about in pharmaceuticals, is there any way you could quickly talk about what kind of deals where potentially you could see a revenue decline, I think that's only in the mega mergers. What kind of deals where you have no impact, M&A deals and Pharma have no impact on your business and what kind of deals or the structure deals would happen that would actually maybe potentially increase revenue from the combined company? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Okay, Paul, good morning. Thanks for the question -- good morning. Well, you know, I've commented about these mergers several times in prior quarters. As you know, many of the announced mergers maybe that were discussed significantly last year actually didn't happen.
In terms of the ones that are happening, the very large ones like the most recent one, the Actavis-Allergan one, these â obviously, when you have very large mergers of two companies that have overlapping therapy categories that will have more impact, because all of a sudden you've got two clients that become one client.
As I've said in the past, typically when that is the case, the spend doesn't go from 2 to 1, it typically goes to 2 to 1.7 or 1.8, okay. And the reason for that is, the different geographies. There's also increased spend in terms much services for rationalizing sales forces. They might buy more analytics and so on and so forth.
So, typically, we see when it's an exact overlap, we will see a cancellation on the data side. We will see growth on the technology and services areas. And that, kind of, will offset some of the losses of data. When it's a merger that has complimentary pipelines rather than overlapping and different therapy categories, then of course there is no cancellation of data contracts simply because they still need to track the different therapy areas, and so that's usually â that's not going to decline in the data span, actually it leads to an increase in services because when the companies merge, there's a need to redesign their sales force, redesign their compensation programs for example to optimize their footprint and all of that, we're extremely good position to provide those services.
Often also when there is a merger, that's driven by cost take out opportunities, we are in a position to offer commercial outsourcing of previously in-house analytics activities at both companies.
So, the impact is there. I've said before, I think I recall my comments early last year when there was a long list of about 10 mergers that were being discussed. I said at the time if all of this happened, we see a headwind of about half a point a couple of your hands in terms of our advertised revenue growth.
So, with respect to what's in the news now, I don't see any material or significant impact. We've looked at it and it's just not even in the rounding.
Paul Ginocchio
Thanks. In fact, if I could just sneak another one or a follow-up. Have you seen a situation where two companies get together in the info services business actually sees a pickup in revenue, has that happened historically?
Ari Bousbib
Usually, it happens when, for example, a larger company buys a smaller company, like the biotech company or a smaller midsized company that's in different geographies or different therapy categories. And all of a sudden, someone who wasn't a client either because they were buying from someone else or because they just could not afford the data so all of a sudden now the larger client who's already a client for their own drugs are now need to cover, need to grow in the acquired businesses therapy so we might see, you know, some small increases in data spend.
Paul Ginocchio
Thank you very much.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll proceed to our next question. It's from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Go ahead.
Peter Appert
Thanks, good morning. So Ari, you highlighted a lot quarry which is very impressive. I was hoping you might give us a little insight in terms of what drives it. Are these new users? Are you displacing existing products and winning share in the process? Is there any price implication associated with these wins? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Well, bear in mind, you know, we have a broad sweep of offering. Our strategy is strategy of integrating multiple applications that automate more to previously labor intensive or inefficient prophesies. We also provide applications for newly required either compliance or -- for example, the adverse effect tracking application which is required for pharmacovigilance and others, such requirements.
So we provide technology solution that enables our clients to achieve the compliance requirements which they would simply not otherwise be able to accomplish. So the beauty of what we do is that we provide an integrated suite of applications, obviously, the client can buy one application or two applications or the whole suite.
The value is the integration because it's seamless changes. You can make a change in an application. It's immediately done toward a cascade of other applications without the need to hire specific IT implementation, vendors and so on. So less labor, less room for error, less time and less cost.
And the second differentiating advantage that we have is that we are very intimate with the data. We're not just a provider of a technology application. We also provide the data that actually is the content, the real stuff, if you will, that goes into the plumbing that the application represents.
And because we are so intimate with the data, we are able to integrate this data into these applications in an easier fashion with less cost and less time. In many cases, our applications come with pre-integrated data. So again avoiding the need to hire an implementation provider.
So because of that, we are able, you see that our clients are very receptive to this value proposition. And in addition to that frankly we can â our applications are plug-and-play. You can â you don't have to buy only our applications. They are a series of APIs that allow the modules to be easily and seamlessly intergraded with anybody else's applications.
So we're not just, you know, a MDM provider or MCM or a CRM solution provider. We have a full sweat of products and we'll suit the needs of our clients.
And I think in all our conversations, especially since we've had the Cegedim acquisition, we've spend a lot of time with our clients and they're very intrigued by the approach and we've had some additional wins resulting from this.
So the wins I listed were in the core, tech services, business of IMS and then I additionally provided a few of the more notable wins that we've had that result from the integration of the Cegedim products.
Bear in mind we're not fully done with integrating these offerings. We just owned the company for a quarter but we're very excited by the reaction so far and, you know, I've personally been involved in calls with clients, even on MI sales processes that were going on and we see that clients are very, very interested in looking at how different the CRM application of Cegedim looks when it's integrated with IMS.
Peter Appert
But the specific question, it's less about new use cases for the products, it's more about displacing existing vendors that you're offering a better solution relative to?
Ari Bousbib
Once again yes and no. Yes for the most part you're correct. Especially for the Cegedim application. It's just, you know, existing needs with idle displace or replace or extend. And forward application like Nexxus social which is the adverse effects tracking application which is very successful in the marketplace due to increased compliance requirements, or even our compliance solution that we got from IMS, it's called 360 -- what do we call it? Aggregate spend, right. These are solutions that are seeing very high growth rates. Still small in the overall numbers for us, but it's growing at very, very high rates because this is a new need by a new use. Okay, thank you.
Peter Appert
Okay. Thanks, Ari.
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Go ahead.
David Larsen
Hey guys, congratulations on a very good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the your streamlining efforts and, you know, cost reduction efforts in consolidation of facilities and sort of your ability to leverage your margin there through those efforts? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, David. Look, I mean that's the easiest thing to talk about. You know, that's operations 101. A lot of integration work, those of us who like to get into the weeds, we are excited about this because there's a lot there, really a lot. And the more we learn about these, the more we are excited about the cost and take that opportunity.
You know, we told you $50 million run rate savings at the time when I think the Euro rate was like, 135 last year and we haven't changed that number even though the Euro rate is like under 1.10. So really if you just do the math, we've kind of raised the goal post without saying it because it's more like in the, 60 plus million dollars that we've agreed to let go. We haven't adjusted that $50 million down at all.
Secondly, I just told you today in passing that we now expect that run rate savings by the end of 2017. We previously had said that it would take three years from the acquisition which would have meant sometime in the middle of 2018 if you wanted to calculate that precisely.
So we feel confident with the timing. We feel confident with the number. There's a lot of very granular work as you can imagine. We have full-time resources. There is separate team that reports directly to me that's dedicated to the efforts. We are caring obviously additional expenses in this transition particularly during 2015.
For the balance of the year, we would go faster if we could, but as you are very well aware, in many foreign countries, in Europe in particular, there from processes which we need to respect with the unions, the works councils, consultations and so on and so forth before we can actually rationalize and restructure. That's for the people side of the cost take outs which as you can well imagine is a significant portion of the synergies.
The other portion of course is, you know, the real estate -- and that you have to renegotiate contracts, leases, we have -- I mean I could give you numbers. It's really harder pass some leases that we have to look at the facilities that we have to consolidate. The IT systems and infrastructure that, you know, servers that we have to decommission. Again there's a lot of heavy lifting in the trenches type of work and you can rest assured that we're on top of everything and we continue to identify opportunities.
But again, we all would like this overnight. It just takes time. Not just the works council consultations but you have two sales forces saying I don't want to name any country, but that similar in the country that we're not. If we have sales forces in Cuba, we would say, well, is the Cegedim sales force better than ours? Which ones? We got to through and personal evaluating people. Who do you retain? So, for a while we're carrying redundant resources until we figure it out. And sometimes it takes a couple of weeks to figure it out and sometimes it takes six months. Okay, so these are the type of issues we're working with.
David Larsen
Sounds great. Thanks a lot. Congrats upon a good quarter.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Go right ahead.
Andrew Steinerman
Hi. Ari, I just wanted to check if the acquisition revenue in the quarter outside of Cegedim was about 1%?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. You mean the other little acquisition that we do on an ongoing basis? We didn't do a lot, so it's about a point, yes. Correct.
Andrew Steinerman
And I know one of the acquisitions impact RX, it looks like it would have been in the information segment, right?
Ari Bousbib
That was very tiny, Andrew. So, it's kind of in the rounding.
Andrew Steinerman
Okay. Fair. So, I just want to ask just one trending question...
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, the bulk of the â yeah, the bulk of the acquisition â of those sources of acquisition as usual are in technology services.
Andrew Steinerman
Perfect. And so, let me just ask one trending question. I think you mostly answered it already. So when we think about the information division which was a constant currency, 0.5% growth in the second quarter. There was some pull-through from the first quarter which was a 3, which actually was a strongest number in a very long time.
When we think about the trending going forward for the information segment, I think you're trying to ask us to look at the first half together. Or is there anything about the second quarter that's telling about trends going forward for growth rate of the information segment?
Ari Bousbib
No, I think, Andrew, you're right on the mark. Look, we said in the first quarter â first of all, longer term, we've always said, the info business is a low single digit growth business. We've grown 0% to 2% in the past five years. We said in the first quarter there were some put forward by clients of data purchases, which show that 3%, which was unusually high.
And we told you that that was high. If you look at the first half, I think Ron reported 1.8% on equal side of constant currency. So that's, kind of, in the range of what we do and you're going to see this bounce around quarter to quarter between those numbers. So nothing to be alarmed an as trend or one way or the other.
Andrew Steinerman
Great. Thanks for taking the time. Appreciate it.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll get to our next question from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Go ahead.
Manav Patnaik
Hey, good morning, gentlemen. First question, I was â I'm just trying to understand, you've always had many years now of the double-digit growth in tech services side. I think one of the comments, you made in one of the wins was how the customer was doing everything manual and now with your suite of solution, it's pretty much in the cloud automated. What penetration level of that are we in the industry like how many more are sort of, doing it manual? Just any sort of, color on, you know, where we are in that phasing of everybody moving to the cloud or the new technologies?
Ari Bousbib
Look, I think the penetration overall, I think is still in its very early stages. There are, you know, segments of the Pharma market, mostly large Pharma, and in particular areas like for example CRM but again, we view CRM as one application, nothing more. And within that particular niche segment, there has been very high penetration of a sack-based solutions mostly because you've had a successful and aggressive provider over the past few years.
And so within that particular segment, you can say that the transformation within large Pharma in CRM stats-based solutions is pretty much complete, okay. But other than that one niche, I remind you that we view our market of technology services as a very large, $45 billion, $50 billion market that's growing somewhere between 5% and 10%. And so we feel that there is a lot more room to grow and so that means that horizontally across multiple applications well beyond CRM because of many, many manual processes and this is just looking at the commercial space, okay. There's a lot to do on the clinical side. I mentioned the win with the CRO, but we've got -- we're making ForEx as well with Pharma itself in terms of clinical trial optimization solutions.
These are highly manual processes, labor intensive, a lot of, trial and error, a lot of rework and waste and we think that from an operational standpoint, these processes are not optimized. And secondly they are extremely ripe for automation as well.
So again, we think of it as a big, big market there, addressable market as growing provided you don't limit it just to CRM and just to Pharma, to large Pharma. Again, beyond large Pharma, we have a huge market there.
Despite all the consolidations we've been talking about, large Pharma has actually been declining as a proportion of the total biopharmaceutical market worldwide and it does not represent the bulk of the growth. The bulk of the growth comes from mid-sized small and overseas companies.
If you look at the overall markets and we would be happy to supply specific data to that effect. So, we are very, very aggressive and many of the wins that I talked about, even on the mobile intelligence platform are with those markets with those segments.
Manav Patnaik
Okay.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you.
Manav Patnaik
Thank you. And then just on -- I missed on the Cegedim deal, real quick, I mean obviously you got the cost synergies are coming in early, revenue synergies seem to be -- you eluded a bit, but specific to the CRM application, can you -- like, I guess our understanding was in a Cegedim held sort of its own and kept its customers and then there was basically share battle between the other two players in this case. Now, that you guys have it under this sort of the one stop shop solution, do you anticipate sort of growing that base and taking share from the other guys?
Ari Bousbib
Well, I mean we're talking specifically about the CRM, which again, that's not our strategy; we're not just looking at CRM per se. We believe that CRM is a -- the way it's done today essentially addresses yesterday's sales rep.
We're living in a multi-channel world where the need to target effectively your ultimate customer which is your prescribing physician as well as the healthcare organizations and the payers.
You need to engage multi-stakeholders multi-channel. And so CRM needs to incorporate a lot of that, it's not longer -- and it's not just adding the word multi-channel in front of CRM that is going to make it multi-channel engagement solution.
You need actually the rest of the applications and more importantly, the data content that comes with it. So, we think that to answer your question, it's not really a battle, we don't think that's a two competitors or one competitor, we're looking at the overall market.
With respect to CRM per se, bear in mind these are long cycles, multi-year cycles, five years or so and, large pharma pretty much made choices and we think the next big battle on the CRM per se is moving to 2017-2018 timeframe and you can assume that we would be more than ready to get a fair share of that market as well.
Manav Patnaik
Thank you, Ari.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Manav.
Operator
Thank you. We'll get to our next question, the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Go right ahead.
Toni Kaplan
Hi. Ron, you spoke about some extra investment in this past quarter and expect it to continue in 3Q. Can you just talk about how much that impacted the margins this quarter and whether it's supposed to be a similar impact in 3Q.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah. Well, the first thing, Toni to look at when you're looking at margins is Cegedim had a major impact by far in the quarter because they come in at a much lower margin than us. And that's obvious but just bears repeating anyway.
Secondarily on the information side, I'm not going to tell you precisely how much your information investment was up, but we did have increased investment in several areas that I mentioned. One obviously a specialty data; secondly, real road evidence; thirdly we're rolling out some new offerings in different parts of the world and we're investing to be able to deliver those offerings. And the way our information business works is that when we buy data sets, we expense them immediately. So very often the revenue takes some time to come through. So it does have a drag on margins.
And there's some variability to that quarter-to-quarter. What we happen to buy in a particular quarter and I just wanted to point out that in the second and third quarter, that's when we had the highest year-over-year impact. And you see that in our combined margins where you're going to see, you know the first quarter and fourth quarter margin comparison year-over-year look as little better than the second and third quarter. And since you guys can all do math, I thought I would point out the reason for it.
Toni Kaplan
Got it. And Ari, I think you mentioned you've been getting a strong client response, you know, post the Cegedim combination. I just wanted to figure out, you know, what are some of the things that clients are highlighting?
Ari Bousbib
Well, clients are intrigued, you know -- like, clients are interested in functionality, cost reductions and of course, how does that change the way I do business and how can you help me? So again I mentioned before the two main ways we are able to help them is by integrating the different applications, eliminating the needs for implementation partners and integration between different applications. And number two, we can pre-integrate the data and we know the data very well.
So the cost to deploy and the speed of the deployment is very quick. We did -- I was having a review yesterday. I think, you know, we're able to deploy a. MI solution in China, I believe, within -- really a few days or 4,000 or 5,000 users in one go. And the reason we're able to do that is again because we're able to pre-integrate the data ourselves.
You know, in a different situation where you have another CRM solution and you now need to go to China and the CRM solution provided does not have the resources that we have on site and doesn't have the ability to pre-integrate the data because they have to go out and hire a subcontractor, an implementation partner, et cetera. This could take literally a year or more, okay.
So you've got global CRM deployment solutions where clients are in some cases were complaining that CRM solutions for which they the global deployment schedule three or four years ago, they are only now getting to some of the smaller countries. And so again, we have 15,000 people in 100 countries.
Tom Kinsley
All right. I think we've probably coming up on the hour. Why don't we sneak one more in and we'll call it the last one, operator. Thank you.
Operator
Certainly, of course. And our next question from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Go right ahead.
John Kreger
Hi. Thanks. A couple of revenue questions. You've done a great job of sort of identifying how Cegedim rolled in and impacted the top line. How do you guys think about how that chunk of revenue will trend over the next year or two? I know initially you talked about some legacy premise-based CRM assets that might decline over time. So now, that you've owned it, any update there?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah. I mean, that's a great question, John. And we should had focused on clearly in our remarks. Thanks for bringing it up, you know, especially [ph] in aggregate we have said, you know, had some revenues that we inherited but and we kind of, had no choice, a couple of lines of business that we are looking at potentially either divesting or shutting down and, of course, the more important one is the legacy on premise mainframe based CRM original solution that is declining at the fast rate and we, kind of, supporting the client that are still on that and facilitating their transition to a size application based model and to MI.
So but this is going to continue to trend down over the next couple of years and therefore, we love to take the overall. We looking on an accounting basis, how to report that but it's come hard because legacy product line, we're discontinuing it. We are not selling it but we still have some revenue associated with that and we can call it from a technical standpoint discontinued operations. So I wish, we could that and show you the underlying growth. So we will do our best to highlight, what that is in future quarters and to give you a sense for the underlying growth. What we reported today is in aggregate, so it does include the declining parts of the Cegedim business that we acquired. We did isolate them.
John Kreger
Great, thanks. And then question about your legacy business. How is the kind of outsourcing oriented business going? I think you put in work flow analytics. Are you seeing any improved uptick there?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, I mean, look, this is growing just as we advertised has been growing in kind of high single-digits and I think that's what we have, even in the second quarter. So if you look at the second quarter -- if you look at the first half, that's where we are on a constant currency basis. Its high single digits, 9% or so.
John Kreger
Thank you.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah. Thank you.
John Kreger
Great, thanks.
Ari Bousbib
All right. Well, look, thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again at the third quarter earnings call and in the meantime, don't hesitate to contact with us your question. And I'd be available with Andrew, Mark Markwick and Reena Patel to help answer your questions. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you disconnect your lines. Have a good day everyone.
