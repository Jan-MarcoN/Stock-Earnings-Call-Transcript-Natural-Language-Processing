Greetings and welcome to the QEP Resources First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Kent. You may begin.
William Kent
Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources first quarter 2016 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you have not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results and a slide presentation with maps and other supporting materials. In todayâs conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure EBITDA which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings. In addition, we are making numerous forward-looking statements to remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which would be out of our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard Doleshek
Thank you, Will and good morning everyone. Before I get into our first quarter results, I want to remind folks that at the beginning of this year we collapsed the bulk of what QEP Marketing was doing in the QEP Energy Company. We terminated the majority of the intercompany agreements between QEP Marketing and QEP Energy. We assigned all of QEP Marketingâs third-party purchasing sale agreements and gathering and processing and transportation contracts for QEP Energy except those contracts related to natural gas storage activities in the Haynesville gathering system.
QEP is no longer the first purchaser of other working interest ownersâ production from QEP operated wells. And as a result, you will notice significantly lower revenues and cost associated with the oil and gas purchase and resale activities. You will also see that we no longer have segment reporting. There is no impact to operating income, net income or adjusted EBITDA from this change.
Okay. Now, turning to our results, similar to the first quarter of 2015, the story in the first quarter of 2016 was all about low commodity prices. In the quarter, we generated net loss of $864 million. The primary contributor to the loss was impairment expense of approximately $1.18 billion, most of which was related to Pinedale and driven by lower forward curve financial gas and NGL prices compared with forward curve at year end 2015.
Adjusted EBITDA was $115.1 million in the first quarter compared to $254 million of adjusted EBITDA generated in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $222.8 million in the first quarter of 2015. Production in the first quarter was 82.7 Bcfe or 1.3 Bcfe lower than the 84 Bcfe reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. Oil volumes were a record 5.2 million barrels, up 113,000 barrels from the fourth quarter levels and NGL volumes were up 1.4 million barrels, up 93,000 barrels from the fourth quarter. Natural gas volumes from 43.4 Bcf, down 2.6 Bcf from the fourth quarter 2015. Crude oil comprised 38% of our total production in the first quarter of 2016, which was a couple of percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 and Chuck will give you more color regarding our first quarter production in his prepared remarks.
Our updated oil production guidance for 2016 is a range of 19 million to 20.5 million barrels, the midpoint of which is up a 0.25 million barrels from our initial guidance midpoint. Our guidance for natural gas and NGL production for 2016 is unchanged from the initial guidance that we provided in February.
QEP Energyâs net realized equivalent price, which reflects the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $3.68 per Mcfe, which was $1.79 per Mcfe or 33% lower than we realized in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $1.93 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the first quarter 2015. The weighted average field level equivalent price in the quarter was $2.93 per Mcfe, which was 22% lower than the fourth quarter of 2015. The equivalent price reflects field level crude oil prices that were $27.77 per barrel, field level NGL prices that were $9.97 per barrel and field level natural gas prices that were $1.96 per Mcf. Field level crude oil revenues account for 59% of total field level revenues, which was 2% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2015. Derivative settlements added $62 million or $0.75 per Mcfe to QEP Energyâs net price realizations compared to adding $1.70 per Mcfe in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $134 million in the quarter down from $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $127 million in the first quarter of 2015. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.73 per Mcfe, which was down $0.02 per Mcfe from the fourth quarter and transportation expense was $0.89 per Mcfe, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses is unchanged at $1.60 to $1.70 per Mcfe for full year 2016.
G&A expenses were $48.7 million, which is up $8.3 million from the fourth quarter primarily as a result of additional legal expenses, which we removed from our â for the purposes of calculating adjusted EBITDA. In April, we streamlined our organizational structure resulting in a workforce reduction of about 6% and expect to incur about $2.2 million in severance expenses associated with the workforce reductions in the second quarter. Our guidance for G&A expenses, ignoring these items, is unchanged at $150 million to $160 million for full year 2016, of which we expect approximately $35 million to be non-cash compensation expense.
Capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $157 million for the quarter. In addition, we made $21 million of acquisitions, of which $6 million was non-cash in the form of forgiveness of a receivable. The midpoint of our guidance for 2016 capital spending for drilling and completion activities is $475 million, which is unchanged from our initial guidance.
With regard to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $7.3 billion, shareholder equity was about $3.5 billion and total debt was approximately $2.2 billion, all of which were our senior notes and we had $616 million of cash. In March, we sold 37.95 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately $369 million. In addition, in March we sent a $32 million ANT payment to the IRS, but we expect a refund of approximately $130 million in taxes later this year.
I will now turn the call over to Chuck.
Chuck Stanley
Good morning, everyone. Since Richardâs already discussed our first quarter operational and financial results, I will spend a few minutes updating you on our plans for the remainder of 2016 and then I will quickly go through each core area and share some additional color on our recent operational results before we move on to Q&A.
As we described during our year end quarter, we responded to the sustained decline in crude oil and natural gas prices by dramatically reducing activity across our asset portfolio. We are focused on living within cash flow. We ramped down our operated drilling fleet from 9 rigs at the end of last year to 4 rigs at the end of the first quarter and today, we are operating 3 rigs, 1 each in the Williston and Permian Basins and 1 in Pinedale. And yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2016 capital investment guidance of $450 million to $500 million, a range we feel quite comfortable with as we ramp down and reduce activity.
We are only drilling wells that generate acceptable returns using current costs and the forward strip prices, excluding the impact of course of our oil and gas derivative portfolio. We continue to believe it doesnât make sense to aggressively consume the highest return on assets in our portfolio simply for the sake of driving production growth while commodity prices remained low.
While we have captured significant price concessions from service providers and material suppliers and we continue to achieve additional savings through efficiency gains over the past 15 months, we think there is still more room for improvement. We continue to optimize our well completion designs, refine well bore placement and evaluate optimum well density in each of our core areas, while simultaneously driving down completed well costs. We are also managing our drilling and completion schedules to position ourselves to take advantage of the Contango in the forward curves and for a return to production growth when prices recover.
Now, let me provide some color on our recent operational results by area. Williston Basin net production averaged 53,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 89% liquids, during the first quarter, a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2015 and a 14% improvement over the first quarter of last year. We completed in turn to sell 17 gross operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 99%, all of them on South Antelope. We also participated in three gross outside operated Bakken Three Forks wells that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter and the average working interest on those was less than 1%. As we have reported you in previous quarters our Williston Basin asset managers are laser focused on organically growing our future development location inventory on our existing acreage through a combination of high density infill development and successful delineation drilling targeting deeper benches of Three Forks formation.
You will recall when we acquired the South Antelope asset back in 2012, we assumed that each 1,280 acre spacing unit would be fully developed with four wells in each of the two productive reservoirs of Middle Bakken and the first bench of the Three Forks formation even though at the time of our acquisition there were no producing Middle Bakken wells on the property. We knew when we bought South Antelope it was in a good spot in the Williston Basin an area that had good rock quality in both target reservoirs, higher oil saturation and slight over pressure, we just didnât understand how good. We continue to see encouraging results from our high density infill development in the Middle Bakken and first bench of the Three Forks effectively doubling the inventory from our acquisition case. And we have been extremely encouraged by the early performance from deeper test in the second and third bench of the Three Forks formation, intervals that we dismissed is likely not productive in our acquisition evaluation and during our initial phase of four wells per reservoir per spacing unit development.
You can see from the performance history the high density infill pilot wells on our South Antelope acreage on Slide 9, these wells have evaluated both 400 foot and 600 foot high density infill well spacing. And the graph shows that normalized or downtime adjusted cumulative production performance from these infill wells continues to track closely the performance of wells that we completed with our enhanced design which you will recall is roughly a 50 stage 1000 pounds of proppant per foot completion design. More importantly, the normalized cumulative production performance from these infill pilot wells continues to significantly outperform the original parent wells that were spaced with the four wells per reservoir per 1,280 acre unit.
During the quarter we continued to collect encouraging data on second bench of the Three Forks and South Antelope as well. You recall, we put our first second bench wells online last summer and we turned four additional second bench wells to sales late in the fourth quarter of last year. As you can see on Slide 11, the performance of this family of wells, eight in total continued to attract significantly above the performance of our original Middle Bakken and first bench Three Forks wells. Late in the first quarter of this year, we completed and turned to sales four more second bench wells but they arenât included in this plot, because there is no meaningful production history by the end of the quarter. In addition to these four recently completed wells, we have five more second bench wells in various stages of progress at the end of the first quarter.
Our first well completed in the third bench of the Three Folks and South Antelope which we turned to sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 with 24 hour IP of 3,058 barrels of oil equivalent per day continues to amaze having produced the staggering 162,000 barrels of oil equivalent during its first 120 days of normalized production. The performance of this well was included on the graph on Slide 11. We also had four additional third bench Three Forks wells in various stages of progress at the end of the first quarter, so we are excited to get those online and watch their performance as well. We continue to make progress driving down wells costs in the Williston basin, current AFE gross drilled and completed well costs for South Antelope which assumes a sliding sleeve completion averages about $5.3 million with costs associated with facilities and artificial lift adding approximately $800,000 per well.
Our operated rig count in the Williston basin dropped from three at the end of fourth quarter of last year to one early in the second quarter of this year. At the end of the quarter we had a total of 20 gross QEP operated drilled and uncompleted wells, 17 on South Antelope and 3 at Fort Berthold with an average working interest of 85%. And we expect by the way that that DUC inventory will increase during the second quarter due to pad development and completion sequencing. We also have interest in an additional 28 gross DUCs that are operated by others with an average working interest of about 4%. Slides 5 through 12 in the slide deck we posted with the release yesterday have additional details on our Williston Basin asset.
Turning to the Permian Basin, daily production during the first quarter averaged a record 16,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day and thatâs about 85% liquids, a 21% increase from the fourth quarter and 86% increase from the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter, we completed and turned to sales seven gross operated horizontal wells. Our latest group of four horizontal wells targeting the Lower Spraberry shale delivered outstanding results with an average 24 hour peak gross rate of 1,602 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Two of the four Spraberry shale wells have been online for 30 days and adjusting for downtime, average cumulative production of 33,417 barrels of oil equivalent during the period. These two wells had lateral lengths of approximately 7,300 feet. Two additional Spraberry shale wells on which we reported initial production last quarter have now reached 90 days of normalized productive life and they have achieved an average cumulative production of 95,199 barrels of oil equivalent. Their laterals are slightly longer about 7,500 feet and our longest lived Spraberry shale well â longest producing shale well is a 9,934 foot lateral and this now achieved 171,210 barrels of oil equivalent after 150 days of normalized production time. So as you can see some outstanding results from this family of Spraberry shale wells.
During the quarter we also completed and turned to sales two additional wells in the Middle Spraberry, a slightly shallower interval with an average 24 hour peak gross rate of 830 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A seventh well which is an exploratory well testing a new play concept in the Permian basin outside the footprint of our existing acreage was also completed and turned to sales during the first quarter. The well is producing and we are evaluating the results, but at this point itâs still too early to share anymore details with you. Similar to the Williston we are focused on organically growing our inventory of development locations on our Permian acreage as well. Our Permian asset team recently completed an integrated study of the Spraberry shale including core, wire line and micro-seismic data which leads us to believe that there are multiple distinct flow units or benches within this interval that are separated by hard limestone baffles or barriers that limit the vertical growth of fractures during stimulation. While this might sound discouraging, it is actually good news because it means the wells that we have drilled and completed to-date despite their very strong performance may only be draining a portion of the Sprayberry shale interval. This means there is likely room for a significant number of additional wells within each spacing unit and we are currently testing a new spacing geometry sort of a modified wine rack geometry, which is shown schematically on Slide 15.
We also continue to reduce well costs in the Permian. The current AFE gross drilled and completed well costs for Spraberry wells averages $5.2 million with costs associated with facilities an artificial lift, adding about $700,000 a well. We had two operated rigs in the Permian Basin at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, which was down to one operated rig by the end of the first quarter and we had an inventory of four QEP operated DUCs, all in the Spraberry shale and all with 100% working interest at the end of the quarter. Slides 13 through 15 provide details on our Permian Basin properties.
Turning quickly to Pinedale, net production averaged 277 million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day and thatâs about 14% liquids during the quarter. Pinedale production always declines sequentially from the fourth quarter levels due to suspension of well completion activities during the coldest months of the winter and during the first quarter we had no completions at Pinedale. Well costs continue to come down at Pinedale too. Current gross AFE drilled and completed well costs for QEP operated wells averaged $2.7 million with facilities and plunger lift adding a couple of hundred â $200,000 of additional cost per well. At the end of the quarter we had one QEP operated rig working at Pinedale down from three at the end of last year and at quarter end we had an inventory of 31 gross operated QEP DUCs with an average working interest of 61%. Slide 16 provides details on our Pinedale property.
Turning to the Uinta Basin, net production averaged 80 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, thatâs about 21% liquids during the first quarter, a 13% increase over the fourth quarter of last year and 4% above our first quarter 2015 levels. About 52 million cubic feet equivalent per day of the total volume was from the lower Mesaverde play and that volume was compromised of about 9% liquids. During the quarter we completed and turned to sales a pad of eight new directionally drilled vertical wells, primarily targeting the Lower Mesaverde. These are Pinedale type wells drilled from a single pad and drilled out directionally to the targets. All eight wells performed above our pre-drill estimates and combined the eight wells achieved a peak 24 hour gross rate of about 29.1 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. The eight wells have produced six-tenths of a billion cubic feet of gas after only 29 days online, so very strong performance from these wells.
We continue to be quite pleased with the results from our drilling program in the Uinta Basin, which continues to support our view that the Lower Mesaverde play has Pinedale like potential. The strong results from this latest group of wells are another step on the path to economically developing this multi-trillion cubic foot equivalent resource. At the end of the first quarter we had no drilling activity and no uncompleted wells in inventory in the Uinta Basin. Slides 17 and 18 in the deck provide additional Uinta Basin, Lower Mesaverde details.
We continue to make great progress on improving the competitiveness of our assets by improving well performance with enhanced completion designs combined with a relentless focus on driving down completed well costs. We have also made tremendous progress on organically increasing our future development location inventory across our existing asset base through high density infill development and proving up deeper benches in the Three Forks in the Williston Basin and through continued successful delineation of the Spraberry potential in the Permian. We are also making great progress unlocking the multi-Tcf potential in the Uinta Basin asset, as evidenced by the performance of our most recent group of Lower Mesaverde wells.
From an operational perspective, all of our assets are performing quite well and our teams of talented asset managers have stepped up their efforts to enhance performance on all of the assets in our portfolio. A lot of our focus on this call and frankly in our communications over the last several years has been on rebalancing our portfolio to increase exposure to crude oil and I think we have been quite successful in doing so. But I think itâs also important to remind investors that we had a balanced portfolio world class crude oil and natural gas assets. And these gas properties are well positioned both from a cost basis and from a geographic location perspective to respond to what we see as changing fundamentals in the natural gas markets late this year and into 2017.
From a financial perspective as Richard mentioned earlier, we have made the decision earlier in the first quarter to raise additional capital to bolster our balance sheet to maximize our flexibility in a lower for longer commodity price environment with an equity issuance that raised net proceeds of almost $369 million. With over $600 million of cash and an un-drawn revolving unsecured revolving credit facility we are in a great position to be opportunistic in a tough market. Tactically we believe â we continue to believe that reigning in capital investments, slowing down growth and preserving liquidity with allow QEP to successfully navigate through the current commodity price cycle and emerge well positioned for the future.
With that Michele we can open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. Please proceed with your question.
David Heikkinen
Good morning guys. Chuck and thanks for the cumulative volumes on the Lower Spraberry wells. As we looked at Spraberry, you guys are definitely tracking, it looks like a couple million barrel type curve on these cumes and actually the results just favor even above that, can you talk through expectations of production profile, yet I know type curves are early, but is there a reason why things would deviate from the 30 day, 90 day and 150 day rates you gave. And then as you go into any other area, how do you think about the diversity across the potential for 16 wells that accounted on your modified wine rack, can you talk about expectation for cumes in the same type of timeframe?
Chuck Stanley
So thanks, David. A couple of questions there. Let me see if I can handle them sequentially. First we are quite pleased with these results. We really learned a lot from the integrated study we did on two things. One, exactly where to land the wells and then recognition that these frac barriers could limit vertical growth and as I have said in my prepared remarks, at first you think itâs a bad thing and then you realize that these very strong wells, which by the way, we have been landing them toward the bottom of the interval that these very strong well results are only accessing roughly a third of the Spraberry shale interval. And so that recognition means that obviously we have got a lot more locations potentially in the middle and upper benches of just the Spraberry shale, the Lower Spraberry shale. So thatâs a â that was sort of a big aha for us and these barriers look pretty innocuous on just conventional logs. So evaluating how laterally continuous they are and how effective they are across the entire acreage position will take us some time, but the team is focused on that. Number two, we are right now as we speak drilling the initial wine rack wells to evaluate both vertical and lateral interference or drainage competition and we obviously donât have the results from that yet. But based on what we have seen in other reservoirs, albeit higher quality â much higher quality reservoirs in the Williston Basin, we are pretty excited about the potential to put more wells in this reservoir and recover more of the oil in place because as you know with the initial well densities that folks have been talking about, the recovery factors are in the low the mid-teens at most. And we think there is a lot more oil to capture out of the reservoir. Variability across the acreage, we are lucky in that we have a plethora of vertical wells. A large number of them donât have any â a meaningful logs, but a handful of them do and we have a handful of core.
So we are again in the process of correlating the core data we have to the open hole logs we have from the old vertical wells. But early indications are relatively uniform reservoir properties across our acreage in the Spraberry. What could negatively impact this intra â the early very strong performance, intra-well interference, if we drill the wells too close together, we have got some spacing tests, as you can see on the map in our slides and so far other than just initial simulation related interference. Sometimes we donât see what appears to be well-to-well competition, but itâs early days as you already observed. But overall we are quite pleased and quite excited about the results that we have seen. And if you just take the numbers that I gave and plot them up on the Williston Basin cumulative production curve, you will see that the Spraberry shales look a heck of a lot like Williston Basin wells. Another observation that I would share and itâs unrelated to the Spraberry shale, but I think is important is we believe that the same frac barrier or frac baffle issue exists in the deeper reservoirs, but we really havenât done the detailed core work to accurately place our horizontal laterals in the deeper Wolfcamp intervals. And we are coming back to that now and recognizing that some of the early wells we drilled probably were not optimally landed and may in fact have been right underneath barriers or baffles that impacted the vertical growth of the fractures and could ultimately have impacted the performance of those wells. A lot more work to do there. Right now we are focused on Spraberry and you can see the results today.
David Heikkinen
Thanks Chuck. I will get back in queue. That was a long answer, so I will let other people ask. Thanks.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks David.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
David Tameron
Good morning Chuck. Can you expand a little more about your comments on the gas market and just as you think about 2017, think about the Pinedale, maybe talk as well about kind of NGLs and how you see that playing out just from a regional standpoint over the next, whatever six months to twelve months?
Chuck Stanley
Sure. I think we have all observed over the past quarter the remarkable strengthening of the forward curve and natural gas forward curve, especially in 2017. But itâs also strengthened dramatically in the back half of â16. And I think the market is starting to recognize that at the current level of rig count and the current drilling activity across all of the productive basins in the U.S., the oil basins with associated gas and then there is very little dry gas directed drilling going on that the market is going to be undersupplied once we work through the summer and into the fall and we get into winter. And as you know, natural gas markets reset every winter, but with roughly 1,000 total wells being delivered every month by the current drilling fleet, at some point during the winter and into early 2017, the gas markets have to rebalance, because there is just not enough supply coming into replace decline and some of the supply that is bottled up canât access some of the markets in particularly the Rockies region, but also in the Southeastern part of the U.S. And thatâs one of the reasons why we start to think about â and we havenât shifted that way yet, but we start to think about the optionality in our portfolio to allocate some more capital to gas potentially in the Haynesville as well as Pinedale or Uinta to respond to firming and increasing natural gas prices. And we just see a macro call on production going into â17 as a result of underinvestment across the gas space.
On the NGLs, obviously NGLs pricing has improved. The largest driver of that is obviously declining supply, but also storage levels for propane have gone down, thanks to an increase in exports. And then longer term into â17 and â18 there is a large call on ethane coming down the pike as new ethylene crackers are completed and put online in â17 and â18 that we think longer term will result in positive frac spreads across our producing area, particularly in the Rockies. Obviously, the first place that sees it is the producing areas closest to the facility, so the Gulf Coast region and Southern and Mid-Continent region, but ultimately as the crackers come online, all of the ethane thatâs currently being rejected is going to need to be recovered in order to satisfy the new demand created by the new crackers.
David Tameron
Alright. Thatâs helpful. And then just one more on the Bakken, what are the next couple quarters look like as far as development or maybe the remainder of 2016 is â how does that look compared to what you have done the last six months, what should we expect?
Chuck Stanley
Well, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks, the completion schedule is kind of lumpy because we are sitting on a pad that we will drill out and we will not be completing wells around that rig that are currently drilled in case. So, it will be somewhat lumpy. And as we tried to do, we tried to indicate that quarter-over-quarter we are expecting flattish crude oil production, so it may yo-yo back and forth between Williston and Permian as we pad drill wells on pretty close spacing and sequence completions. So, I wouldnât expect we are not going to complete 17 wells in the second quarter in the Williston Basin. Itâs likely going to be just a handful, if any and if they are on, they are not going to contribute much to second quarter production. But I would also remind you that we put 17 wells online in the first quarter and a good lead number of those wells came on in the second half of the first quarter. So, they are going to have a significant flush contribution into the second quarter production volumes.
David Tameron
Alright. I appreciate it. Thanks.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks, David.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Corales with Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Corales
Good morning, guys.
Chuck Stanley
Good morning.
Brian Corales
A couple of things on the Bakken, can you â those recent completed deeper benches at Three Forks, is there any reason those wells donât look similar than the previous ones you all drilled? I know itâs early.
Chuck Stanley
They look â you know, I think that what I would say is from an oil production volume standpoint they look virtually the same as the shallower benches in the Middle Bakken. They tend to cut a little bit higher percentage of water, because they are in the deeper reservoir, but from a rock and performance perspective, they sure look very similar.
Brian Corales
And do you have â in your reservation acreage do you have those deeper benches there?
Chuck Stanley
Yes, Brian, they are there. They are likely, especially on our acreage, not very perspective. I would say that the â prospective, I would say that the first bench is clearly well developed. The second bench â if you think about it, the Middle Bakken extends the further seats, then the first bench of the Three Forks you kind of step back to the west a ways, three, four, five miles and you see the development of the first bench and then you step back more than that, six or eight miles and you see some evidence of second bench development, but on our acreage very limited for the deeper benches.
Brian Corales
Okay. And then one more if I could. The â if we are looking at the rig count today, if you are going to add â if prices improve and you are going to add rigs, I mean, would it be an easy decision to go to the Bakken or with the developments in the Spraberry shale would you consider putting rig there over the Bakken?
Chuck Stanley
I think that the two are, from an economic perspective, given a couple of developments, one, the recent performance of Spraberry wells, which as we have already described, is quite exciting. Two, we have seen a big decrease in LOE as we have shifted to higher productivity wells, lower contribution from the legacy vertical wells that we inherited when we bought the property a couple of years ago. So, Richard, we have seen our LOE drop from $15 a barrelâ¦.
Richard Doleshek
Down to $6, $7.
Chuck Stanley
Down to $6 to $7 a barrel. Itâs almost a 50% decrease in LOE which is driving enhanced economics as well. So, I think what I would say to you, Brian, is there is a strong desire from both asset teams to get additional holes drilled in the ground. And at the end of the day, itâs going to come down to we are managing of some arm wrestling with Jim Torgerson and itâs also going to come down to where we think we can get the most meaningful results not only to drive production volumes, but also to answer questions about future development, well spacing. When we are sitting in North Dakota, how far East and South does this third bench extend for instance? And so we need to collect additional data before we can just sit on pads and grind out wells. And so both asset managers are fighting for another rig to do some of that delineation work and we will just see. We have been pretty tight with the capital and we will see if the current firming in crude oil prices continues into the second half of the year. We will reopen a discussion with the board on adding another rig and where we add it will depend on who yells the loudest and then the most convincingly.
Brian Corales

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Josh Silverstein
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jim, just following up on the last question, just given the cash balance, I was just wondering if there is anything thatâs limiting you from going to the fourth and the fifth rig potentially going to one in the Bakken and one elsewhere or do more in the Permian or just your thought process as to further accelerating?
Jim Torgerson
I think itâs too early, Josh. I mean certainly, we have seen a firming of prices, crude oil prices and when you sort of step back and look at it, you say, why, because the fundamentals havenât really changed. There is still an structural oversupply in the crude oil markets of a million or depending on which pundit you believe, 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day. So, why are prices fundamentally better and is this sustainable or is it just simply a blip up before it blips back down again? And so we want to see stronger for longer prices before we make a decision to drop an additional rig into either of the assets. And as I said in my prepared remarks at this point the Board and management both agree that accelerating development activity and consuming these great high return locations to drive production in still what I think is a pretty soft commodity tape is not the right use of capital. So we are trying to keep our powder dry. We are looking for opportunities to bolt-on through our existing footprint. And we are continuing to do what we said we are going to do, which is expand the inventory organically on our existing asset base as we delineate additional reservoirs and as we prove up the infill programs. We are obviously pretty far along in the Williston, but the Spraberry results and the potential for multiple take points in the Spraberry shale reservoir tops up the inventory there, quite nicely as well.
Josh Silverstein
Great. Thanks. Itâs helpful. And I guess just sticking on the infill, I was curious if you guys have had any data points as far as the going to 600 foot spacing on the Three Forks one bench. And then maybe some early thought as to how many wells you might be able to get per section for a second or third bench as well?
Chuck Stanley
So we have some Three Forks one bench wells that are drilled at 600 feet and they are constrained on both sides. I think if you look at Slide 8, you can see where we have piloted infill wells and we have done some more on offset pads that are shown in the stars on Slide 8. We have also put some closely spaced wells into the second bench, but I would not call them meaningful data points for two reasons. One, just the small number. And two, relatively short production history. So I think we need more time on those. But one of the things I would say to you is the technical teams are focused on not stacking these wells vertically one on top of the other. So again, kind of the same thing that we talked about in the Spraberry shale, a wine rack type pattern where we stagger these wells so that if you close your eyes and imagine it, we are putting a 10,000 foot lateral a few tens of feet, 60 feet, 70 feet directly under another producing well. And the Three Forks doesnât have the same obvious shale barriers that you see in some other horizons. Itâs just a carbonate, so itâs more brittle. And we just donât want our frac directly underneath and up into an existing well bore and screw it up. So our focus is to try to stay away and stagger the wells. And so it could lead to a slightly odd looking and not geometrically pleasing pattern in the deeper benches in order to avoid the existing wells.
Josh Silverstein
Alright. Thanks guys.
Chuck Stanley

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Smith with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Smith
Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.
Chuck Stanley
Good morning.
Kevin Smith
Most of my questions have been answered. But would you mind going into a little bit more detail about your well cost reductions in South Antelope, essentially what was driving that?
Chuck Stanley
Whatâs driving it, Jim, itâs a combination of justâ¦
Jim Torgerson
We are getting much better prices from our vendors with time. And then we are just getting a lot more efficient. We just continue to improve the drill times.
Chuck Stanley
So the 50-50 vendors andâ¦
Jim Torgerson
I think so.
Chuck Stanley
About 50-50 vendors â at this point. Now earlier on it was probably two-thirds vendor concessions and one-third efficiency and now as we continue to squeeze, itâs about 50-50.
Jim Torgerson
About 50-50 and pipe is a big part of that too as well. Pipe has come way down.
Chuck Stanley
Okay.
Kevin Smith
Got it. And what â can you talk about how much you have reduced your drill times?
Chuck Stanley
I have got a sheet here that we can go to, so todayâ¦
Jim Torgerson
While you are looking up that, we did have one day where we actually drilled 5,500 feet in a lateral in 24 hours. So we are really making good oil there.
Chuck Stanley
So if you go back to 2014 we averaged about 17.2 days from spud to TD. In the first quarter we were down to 12.2 days, thatâs a 29% difference across 1 year â 2 years of experience, basically. So a huge decrease, we averaged 12.2 days in the first quarter for a 10,000 foot lateral.
Kevin Smith
Impressive and thank you. And then lastly, I know this is kind of a minor, but I was just kind of curious from both your point of view and maybe industry, you get a lot more non-op activity in the Bakken this quarter versus last quarter, are you going non-consent on anything or is that just a reduction in overall activity?
Chuck Stanley
No, itâs a reduction of well activity. I think if you go back and let me flip back now to the first slide on our Williston Basin, Slide #5, itâs kind of hard to see unless you blow it up on a computer screen. But we have a lot of yellow across the Williston Basin and a fair amount of thatâs mineral ownership that we have from some legacy acquisitions we made years ago. And so we see sort of a microcosm of industry activity with very small working interest, but we see a lot of well activity and what you see in the decline in non-op activity is a direct reflection of the reduction in activity across the basin and the concentration of activity in a handful of the core areas, some of which we have a little tiny interest in and some we donât. But you are absolutely right, your observation is correct from a couple of years ago when sometimes we would have 20 or 30 non-op wells on the morning report. We just have a handful today and itâs a direct reflection on overall industry activity.
Kevin Smith
Alright. Thank you. Thatâs all I have. I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Daoud with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Gabe Daoud
Good morning, guys. I am hoping maybe we can just get back to the Permian and talk a little bit about the Middle Spraberry results there and going forward maybe the mix between Middle Spraberry and the Spraberry shale drilling throughout 2016?
Chuck Stanley
Second question first. Our efforts right now are focused on the Spraberry shale. Itâs got the best reservoir characteristics, the best well results. Middle Sprayberry is not as good as you saw from the IPs, but still from an economic perspective, competitive but itâs obviously not our first priority. We donât have enough long-term production history on the Middle Spraberry yet to give you a lot of color on it, but itâs better than marginal. Williston Basin wells out around the peripheries of the basin, itâs got â one of the things about the Middle Spraberrry is that it exhibits a shallower decline, so while their IPs might not be as flashy â the 30 day IPs might not be as flashy, the shallower declines lead to pretty robust cumulative production.
Gabe Daoud
Thatâs helpful Chuck. Thanks. And then on the Spraberry inventory and I guess this overall on the slide deck the increased density, can you maybe just talk about what that means to the 775 growth location count that you have previously stated, could we expect maybe some type of update to that at some point throughout 2016 once you get maybe some of these spacing results in the books?
Chuck Stanley
Yes. At this point we canât update it because we donât have the data. As I said, we have built this model that I think is very sound from a technical perspective. We need to see it in the earth to confirm that itâs real, but from everything we have seen, we arenât stimulating the entire Spraberry shale section. The other observation that I made earlier in response to, I think it was David Heikkinenâs question about â this is also I think transferable potentially to other horizons. And we have had a pretty simple model of just a single layer of development wells in each of the intervals and it may very well not be the case. We know for a fact that other operators developing the Wolfcamp in the Southern part of the Midland Basin have been wine racking their wells and getting very strong results. And we donât know why it wouldnât work here as well. But we donât have enough data yet, unfortunately, to answer your question and itâs going to be a while because obviously we need more production performance and we need more data points before we can meaningfully update that inventory number for you.
Gabe Daoud
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot, guys.
Chuck Stanley
Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Please proceed with your question.
Gail Nicholson
Good morning, gentlemen. You talked about there was more water in the lower Three Forks benches than the Middle Bakken. I was just curious does that create a delta on your LOE of the lower Three Forks versus the Middle Bakken?
Chuck Stanley
I am looking at Mr. Torgerson who has his fingers almost together, which I interpret as being tiny. The â a couple of observations. One, we have a very concentrated footprint itself at Antelope. So, from an infrastructure perspective, we move the water by pipe to nearby disposal wells. And two, itâs not massive volumes of water. I mean, itâs not that different from the first bench or Middle Bakken, but itâs noticeably â the oil water ratio is less in the deeper benches. And when we look early on at the time we acquired these assets, we were convinced or at least I was convinced â there were some other people obviously that werenât that the deeper benches were water-bearing and they would make 100% water. So, boy was I proven wrong and I am happy to be proven wrong by the way, but it is not meaningful with respect to LOEs. Itâs not going to change the LOE materially.
Jim Torgerson
We have seen about a 10% increase in LOE from the first quarter of â14.
Chuck Stanley
Right.
Jim Torgerson
First quarter of â14 to first quarter of â16.
Chuck Stanley
But thatâs largely just â yes, noise.
Gail Nicholson
Okay, great. And then just looking at the Williston and thinking of differentials, differentials have definitely come in because the commodities come in. But there has also been a large build out of pipe in the Williston. As you progress through time and hopefully commodity prices continue to rise, do you feel like the historic differential and our higher commodity price for the Williston might have been reduced with that pipeline build-out and how do you think about that?
Chuck Stanley
Well, I think obviously two things. One pipe gives you a lower cost relative to other forms of transport especially if you are riding on the interruptible capacity of those pipes. Two, there has been a lot of build-out and a lot of that, the rail loading and oil handling facilities gives producers like QEP options to access additional markets, which from time-to-time are going to be higher value. And one of the things that drove the build out of the rail infrastructure 4 or 5 years ago was the differential between Brent and LLS versus WTI or Williston crude oil. And so we were able to move oil to the coast and sell it at a higher price than we could sell it in the middle of the country and cover the cost of the rail transport. So over time, I suspect that there will be instances where oil will move preferentially by rail just because of the arbitrage between waterborne cargos, Brent cargos versus pipe borne cargos. So, I like the optionality. It also lessens the vulnerability to infrastructure outages for maintenance and as we see in the northern part of the U.S. for refinery turnarounds and also pipeline outages. So, having the safety valve of rail loading facilities, I think helps keep bases narrower going forward. We were bumping up against total takeaway capacity at times over the past few years and that was one of the drivers of the wider bases.
Gail Nicholson
Okay, great. Thank you.
Chuck Stanley
Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Velie with Capital One. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Velie
Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have one quick one on that Three Forks third bench well. It looks as though around day 50, it breaks higher and goes above the high processing completion line whereas last quarter it looked to be tracking pretty lockstep to that. Is there any distinct reason for that jump?
Chuck Stanley
Absolutely. Thatâs when we turned on the ESP, the Electric Submersible Pump. So, the early time production history was flowing, naturally flowing and then we started to lift the well artificially with a pump. Good observation.
Brian Velie
Thank you. The high processing completions I guess maybe as those pumps came on over time is a little more normalized across?
Chuck Stanley
Yes. Itâs the difference between the smoothing of a large number of wells versus a single well, basically where you can see every little hiccup, but the change in the rate was a direct result of the artificial lift.
Brian Velie
Okay, great. Thatâs all I had. Thank you very much.
Chuck Stanley
