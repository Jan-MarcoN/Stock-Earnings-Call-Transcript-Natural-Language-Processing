Dominik Heger
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results of the first nine months of this year. Todayâs call will be hosted by Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO.
I will now hand over to Georg.
Georg Denoke
Thank you, Dominik and also good afternoon from my side, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to this call. As always I will start with a high level summary of the developments in the first nine months of 2015 on Slide number 3. We realized the increase of revenues by 7.7% to â¬13.6 billion. Operating profit increased by 8.2% to â¬3.1 billion. On a currency adjusted basis, revenue and operating profit were slightly below last yearâs level.
Healthcare continue to deliver stronger growth. Nevertheless the overall macroeconomic environment remained challenging the positive effect from the weakening of the euro against many currencies decreased in the third quarter. We incurred non-recurring cost of â¬192 million in the first nine months. These are related to the restructuring measures of the program which has been introduced in 2014. The total cost of the measures of â¬258 million also includes the expenses of â¬66 million incurred in the fourth quarter of last year.
With this, all measures under the program has been identified and initiated and no additional measures are planned for the fourth quarter of this year. With 23.1%, the Group margin was slightly up. The operating cash flow development was positive with 9.2%. On a reported basis EPS was up by 5%.
I would like to move on to the development of revenue and operating profit by division on the next Slide. The revenue development of the gases division benefited from the payment from exchange rates and the stable comparable growth development. Comparable growth was 2.1% in the first nine months and 2.5% in the third quarter. Engineering revenues developed in line with project progress. Revenues were 10% below the level of last year.
On the right side of the Slide, you see that gases division generated an operating profit of â¬3.1 billion. The margin improved slightly. The engineering division realized an operating profit of â¬169 million. As expected the margin came in at 8.4% in line with our guidance of around 8%.
I will now move on to a more detailed view of the performance in the gases division on Slide number 5. As mentioned earlier, the positive currency contribution decreased in the third quarter. On a nine months basis, the tailwind from the weaker euro came in at 8.8%. The effect was moderated by headwinds from natural gas prices of 1.5%.
And a couple of other factors to which I will come shortly. In the reporting period, comparable growth was 2.1%. This development was also supported by the acquisition of LPG business in Australia which is included since March. Please be aware that comparable growth was negatively affected by couple of factors including the expected end of contracts, lower LPG prices and the repeal of the capital tax in Australia. Adjusted for these additional effects, comparable growth would have been 1.6 percentage points higher and in total 3.7%. For the quarter this number would be 4.4%. Please note that this figure is not adjusted for the lower pass through of electrical energy. I would like to go through comparable growth and adjustments for additional effects on the next Slide number 6.
Healthcare again recorded strong comparable growth of 7.6%. Contributions to the growth were recorded in all geographical regions and in hospital as well as in home care. Growth was driven most significantly by volume growth at Lincare, continuing on site, comparable growth in this product area decreased by 0.6%. The development was adversely effected by turnarounds in particular in the third quarter. Additionally, as you already know, the development was restrained by the end of contracts, which we have mentioned already in this year. Excluding this effect of end of contracts, one side would have recorded compatible growth in the first nine months of plus 2.4%.
Pipe revenues increased by 1.8% on a compatible basis, growth was effected by lower LPG prices. Without this effect, compatible growth in pipe would have amounted to 3.7%. In cylinder, compatible growth amounted to 0.3%. The development was negatively affected by lower LPG prices and the repeal of the Australian carbon tax. Excluding these two effects, cylinder would have grown by 1.6%.
I would now like to continue with revenues by operating segments on Slide 7. Revenue in the year declined by 1.6% on a comparable basis, mainly due to the end of the contract in Italy, as well as the challenging economic environment in Africa and UK. In the Middle East and Eastern Europe, we continue to experience a good growth development. By product area, the highest contribution to growth continues to be from healthcare. In Asia-Pac, comparable growth was 1.1%, solid comparable growth was recorded incliner; the development in the South Pacific region continue to be impacted by the already mentioned impact of the end of contract and on site and lower LPG prices.
From an product area perspective, on site and pipe were the strongest contributors to growth within Asia-Pacific. In Americas, revenue grew by 22.3% compatible growth further accelerated to 8.3%. In particular, our North American home care business delivered significant revenue growth. Also in our North American industry gases business, we realized a positive development which was supported by pipe and specialty gases sales. Meanwhile, the economic climate in South America continued to be weak. Nevertheless we have been able to achieve slight compatible growth in all product areas in South America.
Proceeding now to operating profit by operating segment on the next Slide. Again at start of this year, which increased slightly by 0.4%, in the third quarter, we have to recognize a loss of â¬22 million on receivables of our UKâs customer which entered into liquidation. Despite this impact, the operating margin remains stable on the high level of 29.9%. In Asia-Pacific, operating profit increased by 9.1%, the operating profit development was supported by tailwinds from exchange rates. The margin remained solid despite a weaker South Pacific region. As for the Americas, operating profit increased by 29.2% to â¬977 million with an operating margin of 25.2%. Letâs now take a look at the engineering divisionâs performance on Slide number 9.
I have already outlined and the revenue in the beginning. Despite the challenging environment we were able to deliver a solid margin of 8.4%. Due to the low oil price many customers had postponed their investment decisions within this year, in particular, in the petrochemical industry. This is reflected in a 58% lower order intake in the first half of this year. 
You are all aware that order intake in the engineering business is rather a lumpy thing and you should not compare quarter-on-quarter. In fact, a comparison of quarters is not meaningful. Therefore, please have in mind last year in Q3 we received an order from [SIBUR] for the largest acetylene plant in the world and thatâs the main driver of this relative negative comparison.
The order backlog of EUR3.8 billion remains solid. And as you know as of today we are concrete discussions without now mentioning customers on some major projects. The financial position is outlined on the next slide.
And cash flow from operating activity has improved by 9.2% year-over-year in line with the improvement of the operating profit. Net debt-to-EBITDA decreased slightly since the end of 2014 to 2 times. At the end of the nine months period of 2015 our average cost of debt is below 4%. This reflects our very good credit quality and the dynamic interest rate management. The credit ratings remain unchanged at A plus with S&P and A2 with Moodyâs, the outlook of both ratings is stable. 
And I conclude with the outlook on the last slide of the presentation. There is no change to the previous update which we had provided in July. This means that depending on economic trends and exchange rate developments we anticipate to achieve 2015 revenues in the range of EUR17.9 billion to EUR18.5 billion and operating profit before non-recurring items between EUR4.1 billion and EUR4.3 billion.
In the same timeframe we are seeking to achieve a return on capital employed of 9% to 10%, also depending on economic trends and the exchange rate developments we target to achieve revenues of EUR15.1 billion to EUR15.5 billion and an operating profit between EUR4.1 billion and EUR4.3 billion from the gases division. 
In the engineering division we plan to generate revenues between EUR2.5 billion and EUR2.7 billion with an operating margin of around 8%. We confirm our medium term targets for 2017 of Group operating profit between EUR4.5 billion to EUR4.7 billion and then return on capital employed of 11% to 12%.
Please note that these targets are based on exchange rates prevailing from the targets were communicated at the end of October last year. I also reconfirm the HPO targets of gross cost savings of EUR750 million to EUR900 million in the four years from 2013 to 2016. Additionally, the restructuring measures shall deliver around EUR180 million savings.
Thank you for your attention and interest in Linde and we are happy to take your question now. [indiscernible] you may now call for questions. 
Question-And-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Dear ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Walsh
Thank you very much. Good afternoon all. Thanks for takes my question. It was two really. You touched on it just at the end there regarding the HPO program. Can you just be a bit more specific about your expectations both continuous improvement and gross cost savings in 2016 versus 2015? And in terms of organic growth, itâs my second question, moving into 2016 how much organic growth do you think you can deliver from new project ramps moving into next year? Thanks very much. 
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you Paul for your question. On the HPO program as you know I think we have increased HPO program number 2 above the bend with of what we achieved in HPO number 1 which was slightly below 800 million. From the perspective of the environment where you have seen some stagnation on prices also from a purchasing perspective, I think you should not assume the upper end of the range which is 900 million. We are in the range of what we communicated.
And letâs say that depending on the development of price levels, that will also define how big the final contribution in the next year will be out of that program. Therefore, more important is that we continue really to achieve what we communicated with our customer focus initiative on the restructuring side, mainly in the southern hemisphere of our business, which should drive next year partly into it and then also in 2017 that will ramp up of the program as you know from our communication. So there is really no new thing on our expectations compared to the slides from our communication.
Paul Walsh
Can you just remind me where -- on those programs, can you just remind me what you will have delivered by the end of â15?
Georg Denoke
We are at that moment in time really at the midpoint of the range which we indicated and we are also within this first half year when you say when we communicated last time, is the midpoint of the remaining two years. So from that perspective, I assume we will end up at the slightly above the lower end of the bandwidth because of the impact of prices for purchasing.
Paul Walsh
And on organic growth from project ramps in 2016?
Georg Denoke
I think thatâs a difficult one at that stage honestly from an overall perspective. When you see the numbers which are contributing to that growth in 2016, you would have to add two things; one is, as we communicated, there isnât delay on the production contribution of some of the emerging markets. And we were talking about that last year in October. So that is an additional contribution which comes next year, but which is probably one year more than we originally anticipated. We always have that for emerging market and ramp up for merchant activity itâs up to three years and we have seen some markets really do not meet that time line.
From an on site perspective I think there is no change from the structure contribution, which means normally you see in year three, the peak of the contribution of sales from an investment, which goes onstream in the respective year. So when you go back to the presentation where we have the investment pipeline included, then you can create your math out of that. Some of the projects are growth related some other projects are also cost related. So you will rather see an impact on EBIT not always on the top line that is the both the substitution of our cost position. So at that stage what I wanted to say because we want to close the year and then communicate 2016 targets when we have the full year available.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Clark, Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark
The question is related to Lincare, first of all just clarifying. Obviously the business is still growing well. It looks like it could be almost double digit volume growth. Just want to be clear that in terms of the margin, youâre still obviously probably at least in mind with the Americas, just want to check that. And then also weâre looking ahead to next year in CB3, when CB2 is coming up? Obviously, very high profile and number of locations you were taking out at 100 or so, ahead of that to manage the way through the margin. So just wondering with CB3 obviously weâve had less so the new slow like that. I actually believe your locations have grown again to about 1,100. But when do you see the cost coming out, the volumes back, rebuilding the margin and obviously the margin hit youâre going to take next year with CB3. Because obviously with CB2 with that cost cutting the volume is growing within two years, you were back where you were. So I am just wondering how much correction with CB3, your plans for that?
Georg Denoke
Thanks Peter for that question. I think I can really confirm that the cut off the Lincare performance is in Q3 double digits, itâs year-to-date double digit, so slightly above the 10% and that is driven by volume, as you know that. So we are ahead of letâs say what we expected from an growth perspective and consolidation perspective of that market. So thatâs positive on the margin. I can repeat what Iâve had in the half year, which is contribution above the average of America.
On the CB3 expectations, I think it is really too early to talk about that, even if we are relatively late in the year. But the discussions are still ongoing, there is an price cut expected beginning of Jan, increasing over the period I think also then into the third quarter of 2017. So from that perspective, itâs a shift. The strategy is a little bit different what was originally said that this starts mid of the year 2016. So that is something which you already know, The number you have heard of around â¬400 million, which are in CB3 areas only to be clear I think. That number is the last publicly available information when we acquired Lincare in 2012 and Lincare was growing since then of course also in this area. Therefore we havenât disclosed a number. We only confirm that the last number which was communicated when figures were available were around the US$400 million. So the number will be different and we donât know exactly what the price cut will be. There is for the part within CB3 which is also with small rural related areas for these and distribution cost advantage will be given from the authorities. But itâs not clear yet how that will be handled. So from that perspective, I have to ask for the [occasions]. And when we have that, you will receive this information probably even we then communicate our year end numbers and we probably know best what.
Peter Clark
Okay. It is, it is.
Georg Denoke
What we always will do, you will see a dip next year in margin, I think that is pretty clear. And therefore it would be wrong to tell you something different. And then there will be the recovery through additional cost measures and one is of course location driven but itâs also about our growth as you know in the product service offering, I think we have introduced some additional services also through innovation of medical devices for example. And therefore that will be a party compensation also and that is today visible also in the volume. So itâs not only the CB2 effect from a volume perspective, itâs also the volume part which comes off a new services for patients or advanced services for patients. So I think we delivered really what you -- what we promised in 2012 in August with this acquisition, so we are absolutely in range of a 4% to 6% growth in EBITDA in total terms that was at that point in time the guidance and I think we have delivered top-line more aggressively. And we are able to keep margins above the level what we anticipated. And I donât want to create now the image that I know what the outcome of CB3 is. For 2017 I think there will be probably nine months available that you can grow without then an impact of a price cut. â16 will be more rough I think for us.
Peter Clark
Okay, thank you. And I know [indiscernible] 1,100 locations now, thatâs the last thing I have seen.
Georg Denoke
I think we have reduced as you know from 1,100 to 1,000 down. We are open to capital allocations, probably we are somewhere between 1,050 and 1,100 I would say.
Peter Clark
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Klein, Berenberg. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Klein
Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could tell us what in euro terms is actually the revenue coming out of Venezuela at the moment. You had minus 70 million year-over-year in 2014 and minus 30 million over the nine months 2015. I was just wondering what is left in absolute terms coming out of Venezuela? And secondly, if you could maybe say quickly how big the remaining exposure to the UK steel industry? I think youâre also the supplier to Tata and certain UK steel works. If you could give us a bit of an indication of how big that exposure would be? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So from Venezuela perspective I think you know there are parts which are related to hyperinflation. So I think the year-to-date number is around 30 million in euro terms. And from an UK remaining steel perspective, of course we are supplier of Tata in this kind of sort of cluster auto. I think we are market leader. You can assume that we do have steel exposure also through manufacturing and other parts. So itâs not letâs say for me a new development, of course itâs a big hit for us with a 22 million of [SSI] but when we knew in 2013 that this business was sold from Tata to SSI then it was based also on the price level at that point in time for the steel pre-material honestly and we have seen a significant change.
So I donât have a number for you and I think it would be the wrong analyst assumption now to do a calculation on an expectation which is tomorrow different. So from this perspective I think you can assume with a market share above 60% in UK, Ireland. If we do not have a problem when a steel plant was shut down then no one will have a problem. Therefore we should be one of the major suppliers in certain clusters.
Also here I think the cluster of the key side to which where the shutdown of SSI is taking place that cut is also supplying other clients I think that is important to other customers. So from an cluster impact today, we are fine in that location; nevertheless, the big hit and that of course for the quarterly performance especially.
John Klein
Can I quickly come back to Venezuela, would you have an annual revenue number for the -- in euro terms, what youâre making in Venezuela, not a year-over-year number but the annual revenue that youâre expecting out of the country in 2015?
Georg Denoke
I think the number is, as I said, the year-to-date number was 30 million for the nine months period. So you can do the math.
John Klein
Okay, I am sorry I misunderstood it earlier, okay. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Andreas Heine of MainFirst. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andreas Heine
Could you refer a little bit more on the UK, because for the first time you mentioned UK as an area where you have slower development. And could you also refer to Southeast Asia, what is going on there, so the countries which are not Australia and not China? And in the Lincare I would like to know would you be able in the U.S. homecare business to take part in the consolidation or is the market share of Lincare too high to assume this? And last but not least you have a strong increase in the margin in Americas. Is that all driven by Lincare or did you have also an improvement in other parts of North America. Thank you very much.
Georg Denoke
Thank you for your questions. I think UK itâs the first time that we mentioned that there is some certain decline in the market businesses after two great years. This is also something which we have to say. So when we were talking about the better performance, then in the last year UK were on the positive side. So that is the first time Q3 where this is changing a little bit. So overall I think we have still seen growth there, also supported by the other product segments like healthcare. So I wouldnât now turn into the discussion that of course we have seen since more than 15 years these rationalization trends in UK nevertheless we also have seen growth in other services. Therefore, please do not be carried away now at that stage with the SSI being in liquidation, I think thatâs the point.
So UK is still with a positive growth factor. Moving to South and East Asia, I think you have of course different countries, very different countries, the diversity of that geography is rich. And of course by size also very different. So the market with the highest industrial production growth at that stage is India with very strong program as Moody took over as leader. Of course has this also since yet I wouldnât say no, but nevertheless India is substituting some of the decline you have seen in other markets. And we have mentioned here especially Thailand of course because of also the exposure to oil and gas. But also we do see of course the good development there. We have talked about different development and all of that.
So thatâs an market which is in decline at that stage. Malaysia also of course an market for us very important where we are market leader. We see a more flattish development. So thatâs not an decline here we have a strong PGP position. We do have also of course a broad footprint of hierarchy of our -- by development. Therefore South and East is the mix picture and the lighthouse at that moment in time is India and can be India when we look into the future. There is the pressure from overcapacity in Steel in China which is moving of course into these countries into South and East Asia but also there are answering as you know with the weapons and measures they have in mind.
So from that perspective itâs not queerly flatted, itâs also a little bit protected. When we talk about the consolidation expectations from an market share perspective, itâs always very difficult of course to talk about market share. You know that we have increased market share. I think we are significantly below level where we would say that we do not see consolidation potential, I think we definitely see consolidation potential through our volume growth in the -- of course expected area where of course you need and that is always what we said when we were talking about Lincare strategically. You have to be a cost leader and you have to offer an kind of industrialized cost pattern for of course and service for humans and this combination is very important. Therefore, the cost competitiveness is a very important driver for the consolidation.
Andreas Heine
Yes I basically didnât mean only the consolidation by gaining market share but also by external growth, would that be allowed or is Linde already to be? 
Georg Denoke
I think on the small and definitely that is a possible and that is also what we do. I think I cannot refer to specific things there because there are some more sizable players that would be probably more difficult then.
Andreas Heine
Okay, thanks.
Operator
The next question comes from Martin Roediger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin Roediger
Thank you. Regarding the momentum in the gas business, we see from other chem companies that September and October were pretty poor months in terms of demand. Did you recognize this similar pattern in your business so far? And regarding the -- the second question is regarding the operating cash flow. You made good progress in the first nine months. Is there any reason that you will not beat last yearâs operating cash flow level in the current full year or is there comparison base for Q4 too high? And finally, your quote in the press today that you are in talks with customer regarding long-term project. Can you elaborate on that? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you for your questions. I think we are industrial gases, we are not chemical, right. So from that perspective even if you are covering us as a chemical research analyst, I think you have to see that our pattern is different. We are contracted business, thatâs the first big important part and we are late cycle. So when customers are producing then we still have letâs the resilience in the system because without industry gases no one can produce. So from this perspective our pattern is much more resilient. So we cannot confirm that development because we are in our structure and you know that, thatâs all on the call that this is a resilient profile and there is not these comparable drops which companies were communicated. So from this perspective, if rather, I would say we donât have the October numbers but of course we do track trucking, number of loads, all these things, itâs a rather stable environment where we are in.
I cannot now talk about any contract negotiations, I think you have heard us talking about certain geographies where we do believe that there are opportunities for us independent of certain overcapacity in markets. But here are markets on earth where activity is available for us. And of course we have seen now in the first nine months of course that many customers who were talking about opportunities based on old oil price levels that these were doing their renumbering their calculations, nevertheless some continued I think, therefore itâs difficult really to talk about things but we do see some opportunities which are concrete letâs say that way.
Cash flow, I think the quarter where the comparison was more [difficult] than this quarter because last yearâs quarter Q3 was driven by the big order intake in the engineering for the cracker of SIBUR as I mentioned which was 1.1 billion. So from that perspective, few advance payments were included and therefore we have seen this drop in Q3 comparison drop we are still ahead. I assume for Q4 that we will be ahead of the previous yearâs level. There is no reason that this would be too big. But of course no one knows but overall from a stability of the business, I think I wouldnât consider that as a plan for you.
Martin Roediger
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Benson, Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Benson
Thanks very much. I just want to quiz a little bit on the closures. Can you just give an aggregate figure for the totality of the tonnage expiries that you're talking about and these latest closures as they affect the tonnage business, just to [dimensionalize] what's coming to an end? And I know we can judge what's coming on-stream because of the level of CapEx. Secondly, on the Lincare, just taking Andreas Heine's question a little bit further, when you are making small bolt-on acquisitions, and I think if you look at your cash flow statement you've spent over 100 million on acquisitions so far this year. Can you separate the Lincare performance between acquisition led growth and the underlying growth? And could you just give us a sense of the outlook for engineering? If the order intake stays at these depressed levels, what does it mean in terms of prospects for 2016? Thanks. 
Georg Denoke
Okay, Andrew letâs start with Lincare. I think what we did at Lincare is honestly an acceleration of organic development, when we talk about the smaller acquisitions which we are entertaining in that market. So you are talking about participants in marketplace which are in CB2 areas they didnât gain the license to hunt for new patients. These players want to exit thatâs in calculation of average duration of service for the patient base you can take over. Therefore, thatâs really a normal acceleration of organic development where you have the advantage that you can stop that. And itâs not a big number, itâs probably below I would say, below â¬20 million, from my perspective. I think you have that in the backup, we have to count that as acquisition. So, my friends here telling me that this is around â¬18 million, so you can really -- you should not overestimate that, okay?
Andrew Benson
All right.
Georg Denoke
So from an overall perspective in the tonnage activity, so this number of course has increased through the quarters. This quarter is especially bad in its comparison therefore we are adjusting because all end of contracts are -- we accumulated in that quarter plus you have turnarounds on other locations which are also planned turnaround so we knew that this can com, sometimes we have to shift from an customer therefore itâs always difficult to say that we come, sometimes you have the expansion then and then itâs in the next quarter. But I think we have adjusted that figure for you and you know that how much calculation the end of contract part as we said I think from the year-to-date number minus 0.6 comparable basis it goes then up to 2.4% for the year-to-date development. And that is excluding only to be clear, thatâs excluding the turnarounds, and the turnaround is something again like, I like â¬20 million, I think I would say something like â¬20 million again.
So this is not adjusted here and also not adjusted as electrical energy because we believe itâs a pretty difficult thing on the local locations and next year it can different again. Therefore we have always kept the comparable growth and have given you the additional information. I think this is what I can share with you on the aspect of end of contracts. The last question if you please repeat your last question for me.
Andrew Benson
Order book stays where it is or perhaps you can give some flavor of how you expect the order book to unfold. What it means for the sales and whatâs the outlook for the engineering division? I was just really looking at engineering orders, just so how that can development over the medium term.
Georg Denoke
From the base perspective more confident than we have been in Q1 where everyone was going back into their offices, closing the doors, doing their math, understanding what that means. I think people are now understanding what their expectation is for the future development and then there are some markets where you would see opportunities which are North Africa, which are Russia, which are the Middle East, where people always were in discussions over the last nine months period. So from that perspective, we are not calling off that business. We do see opportunities and we believe that there are concrete opportunities available for us.
And then on the broader order intake perspective there was a relatively when you cut out the big contracts, which we always had year-on-year, when you cut these all, you see that there is a relatively stable development on the smaller end of that market. So, that has not dropped like close to 70% number. That is really rather stable in some areas itâs even a little bit above the previous year level. So, that is I think what I would give you as an impression at that stage. And then you would have always keep in mind that when you experience something like we experienced in 2015 from an oil and gas type perspective, then you want to have an order backlog like we do. And I think that is the other part. So there is of course a period where it becomes more difficult from an absorption perspective and overhead perspective. But we are not there yet and therefore we donât want to talk about that because we are focusing on opportunities and that is here I think the message we have to give to you.
Andrew Benson
Okay, but is there a reason to believe that â16 is going to be a tougher year than â15 which is a tougher year than â14 numbers thatâs so reasonable in engineering?
Georg Denoke
From an scenario based thinking you can say it could be a tougher year, it could be a tougher year. It depends on certain things happening and then it could be a similar year than â15, so I wouldnât now open up that scenario again. Please take that as caution, but it should show you that we are in scenario thinking plans. And our upper case scenario is not worth than 2015, our lower base scenario is more difficult than â15.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Markus Mayer, Baader Helvea. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Markus Mayer
Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen. Several questions. Firstly, on your engineering division, you had roughly 30 million restructuring in the quarter. Can you give us concrete majeures and more color on those measures? Then secondly, can you give us a number what the cash outflows from the restructuring measures were there in Q3 in the cash flow? And then thirdly, can you give us a number of the reactivity projects, i.e. work in progress you have on the balance sheet? And then lastly, we saw a lot of force measures among petrochemicals in the first half. You might think that they overcut maintenance CapEx. Is this an upside for Linde's engineering business? 
Georg Denoke
Can you repeat the last part?
Markus Mayer
Yes. The last part was in the chemical sector at least we saw a lot of force majeures among petrochemical companies, and you might think that they have overcut their maintenance CapEx spendings and therefore have to invest more over the next years. Is this an upside for Linde's engineering business? 
Georg Denoke
Letâs say that way, I think there are certainly also upside of the letâs say development in the market you have seen. One of these upside is that -- or letâs say changes which are positive for the development, I wouldnât say that thereâs brutal upside but letâs say that way. When we talk about our assumptions two years ago about the continuation of naphtha crackers in parts of the world, that also has changed, right. From a natural perspective the naphtha cracker debate pretty brilliant compare to an [ethane] cracker. And therefore, there will be also re-venting opportunities in markets like that. I think it would be now too much on the steep of that call to go through the maintenance assumptions. If you see it like that way then definitely it would be an upside. I wouldnât now make a pattern out of that because normally like we do, people are of course restricted on cash but maintenance and repair, everyone knows that it comes back at one moment in time. And from a safety perspective, also you have to have that in mind. So itâs difficult for me to confirm that.
So from a perspective of the cost measures we have taken, these are the normal cost measures you would expect in a declining market where you do have certain capacity available and you have [flexation] for us and that is what we use also from an engineering perspective. 
On the cash flow number, I think I donât want to have an isolated communication on the cash out because then you also can say there are other things, there are less prepayments and then I add that, back up the number, itâs of course something like, itâs above 50 million itâs below 100 letâs say that way. But I wouldnât now adjust that easily because you have seen the drop in the prepayment. So from this perspective, there is also additional cash out of the implementation of the measures overall for the focus program there, customer focus program also next year. I think there some things will come in Q4 and then there will be also additional cash flow out -- cash outflow in the next year.
Markus Mayer
Then also the last question on the project -- activity project on the balance sheet?
Georg Denoke
The assets under construction you mean?
Markus Mayer
Yes, under construction also yes.
Georg Denoke
That is going down, I think we will give an update on the year end number. Only remind you in end of 2013 it was 1.7 billion overall, end of â14, 2 billion of course. At the end of the year itâs also sometimes ramping up because we are ordering on the smaller part of activities like additional GDE, smaller projects. But we should be below the last yearâs number definitely.
Markus Mayer
Okay.
Georg Denoke
At the year end, yes.
Markus Mayer
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Mackey, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Mackey
Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Just I've got three questions, please. Firstly, I wonder if you could just, to help us model, just remind us exactly when we annualize the Italian and the Australian contract expiries and the carbon tax repeal, please. The second one is going back to the whole SSI and Tata situation. Probably talked around it a lot, but if I can be blunt, can you tell us what revenues are going to -- to what extent we should see revenues step down for the loss of those two customer contracts? And do you expect to receive any sort of one-off payments, for instance from SSI, or is the receivables write-off, is that acknowledging basically that in a bankruptcy situation you can't -- you're not expecting to get any compensation at all? And then the final question is, often one of my favourites, but [Gist]. We've seen a stepdown in margins in the others, or in [Gist], in the third quarter. M&S renegotiated its distribution contract is the third quarter margin, the number that we should assume for the time being and the basis on which any potential third party might look to negotiate a potential acquisition price, please. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
On the last one I rather keep that for the marketing phase, so no I am kidding. I think on the truth is probably somewhere in between because that business also grow and you always know that the fourth quarter is a different quarter with all the Christmas activity. So, therefore I donât want to give you a guidance, I think youâve seen the slight level, fourth quarter I think will be more pronounced but donât over expect that. Tata, I think Tata is our customer and remains our customer, so Tata has not stopped activity. This was SSI was a former Tata location. They have sold that business to SSI. And SSI is shutting down only to be pretty clear here. Tata is a very important customer and from a major geography perspective, a customer, so please correct that if you have misunderstood that. So itâs about [25]â¦
Peter Mackey
But Tata is also closing some capacity, isn't it?
Georg Denoke
Tata is -- I mean only to tell you, of course I grew up in steel when I started my career 30 years ago, but only a short period of time. But I have seen steel they were also adjusting capacity, they were always doing product segmentation for better products and better marketing here in Europe and they have adjusted I think capacity. But thatâs because for Tata, and thatâs not of course for Linde. So from that perspective, then you would have to talk about that. I think itâs absolutely right what you were asking on SSI because administrators probably are listening. We havenât -- it's an accounting measure that we have took the hit of 22 million. And of course we hope because we have been critical suppliers since a while that we can recover something. But that is not expressed in my quarterly communication plus I took a hit, but I took a hit on a corporate level because I thought thatâs the worst case assumption and we donât know yet, so that is the point.
Peter Mackey
And what is the revenue that relates to the SSI contract that will drop out, presumably, from the fourth quarter?
Georg Denoke
I think itâs around -- it's a little bit above 10 millionâ¦
Peter Mackey
Right. Per quarter or annually? Per quarter?
Georg Denoke
Quarterly of course so now I mean you have deep in your model Peter I think. Therefore I give you a flat answer on your first question, take it on the annual basis what we have of course Q4 is a little bit better because that was when I think Italy started within Q4 and therefore it end somewhere in Q4. So from that perspective itâs I think November. But the rest more or less annualized.
Peter Mackey
Yes, and probably [indiscernible] went in the second quarter, is that correct?
Georg Denoke
Thatâs correct.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Tyler, Redburn. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Neil Tyler
Just one quick additional detail on the same topic, I'm afraid, Georg, so apologies for that upfront. Just looking at the press reports over the last few months, suggested that you'd signed a new contract with SSI in July of this year, and as well as one in July, I believe, of 2013. So can you possibly provide one more figure, which is the asset value attributable to either or both of those contracts? Because certainly the latter report I read suggested that you had intended to build a new ASU as a consequence of that contract. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Press releases are always a difficult thing, especially when youâre in a quarterly call. So I would say the following, and I tried to anticipate your question honestly because I felt that the essence in that clusters available are covered by additional customers in that cluster. So the question about the value of the asset base is not important.
Operator
Thank you. There is one follow up question from Markus Mayer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Markus Mayer
Coming back to Andreas' question on the market shares in the U.S., and if I remember right, when you took over Lincare your market share was roughly 28%, around about, and then you acquired market share. So is it fair to assume that you have now around about 32%, 35% market share? And when competitive bidding part two took place, or before that, a lot of your smaller -- not only smaller but also the competitors which are only on number three, four and five position they had margins around the breakeven level and then potentially due to competitive bidding they came down below the breakeven. Do you still see that these kinds of competitors are at this margin level, and if some of the competitors are said to be for sale that the prices for these companies have moved accordingly to these margin levels? 
Georg Denoke
Look I have no number available for you honestly because thatâs a pretty close market from a perspective there or not public. So thatâs difficult, so I canât give you an answer on that. I only want to correct your assumption, I think itâs 28% when we started and the last number we communicated was 32%. Thank you.
Markus Mayer
Okay.
Operator
Thank you. There are currently no further questions. I hand back over to Mr. Denoke.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you very much for that detailed discussions and I hope to hear you next year when we have our annual communication and looking forward to it. Thank you. All the best for you. Bye, bye.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. This call has been concluded. You may now disconnect.
