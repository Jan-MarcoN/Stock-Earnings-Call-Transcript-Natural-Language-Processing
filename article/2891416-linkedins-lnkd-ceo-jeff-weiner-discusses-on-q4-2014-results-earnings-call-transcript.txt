Good day and welcome to the LinkedInâs Fourth Quarter 2014 Full Year Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only model. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and then instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, todayâs call is being recorded. Thank you.
Iâll now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Sonefeldt, Head of Investor Education. Please go ahead sir.
Matt Sonefeldt
Welcome to LinkedInâs fourth quarter of 2014 results call. Joining me today to discuss our results are CEO, Jeff Weiner; and CFO, Steve Sordello.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, management will make forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements relating to expected member growth and engagement, our product offerings including mobile and our product deployment process, the results of our R&D efforts, revenue including revenue growth rates of our three product lines talent solutions, marketing solutions, and premium subscriptions, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, share dilution, taxes, the product mix between online and field sales, churn rate and expenses. 
Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the section entitled âRisk Factorsâ in our quarterly and annual reports, and we refer you to these filings.
Also, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the companyâs performance. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables in our earnings release. This conference call is also being broadcast on the web and is available through the investor relations section of the LinkedIn website.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Jeff Weiner.
Jeff Weiner
Thank you, Matt, and welcome to todayâs conference call. Iâll start by summarizing the operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014, and Iâll recap some of the key milestones that highlight the success of our strategy. Iâll then turn it over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers and outlook.
Q4 was a strong quarter, bringing to a close another successful year of growth and innovation. One year ago, we began a number of multi-year strategic investments in the platform. We continued our transition from desktop to mobile, and also focused on initiatives in jobs, content, and global expansion. While still early, we made significant progress on these priorities in 2014, and maintained solid growth across all member ecosystem metrics while delivering record financial results.
For Q4, overall revenues grew 44% to a record $643 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $179 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. For the full year 2014, revenue was $2.22 billion, up 45% and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $592 million, and a non-GAAP EPS of $2.02.
In Q4, our platform continued to show strong momentum, as measured by unique visiting members and member page views. During Q4, cumulative members grew 25% to 347 million, unique visiting members grew 23% to an average of 93 million per month, and member page views grew 34%, well ahead of unique member growth. Again, we saw a year-over-year increase in member page views per unique visiting member, demonstrating strengthening organic engagement. 
Our reach is much broader when including SlideShare, which approached nearly 70 million monthly unique visitors during Q4. LinkedIn creates value for members by connecting them to the people, knowledge, and opportunities that matter most to them professionally. 
Today, we do this for nearly one-half of the worldâs professionals and students. Yet, our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce, all 3 billion of them, by building the worldâs first economic graph. In the last year, weâve made meaningful strides against several of our multi-year initiatives that will help us achieve our vision.
Mobile was a top strategic priority for LinkedIn in 2014, and we focused our resources to ensure that our product and engineering organizations were fully mobilized. In 2014, we continued to execute against our multi-app strategy, which now includes our flagship LinkedIn app, Connected, Pulse, Jobs, and SlideShare. 
For our talent acquisition customers, we improved the Recruiter app, and we released a new Sales Navigator app for outbound sales customers. In the fourth quarter, mobile accounted for 49% of unique member visits to LinkedIn and is growing at double the rate of overall member activity.
Increasing the scale and relevance of jobs on LinkedIn was also a major investment in 2014, aligned with our core value proposition of helping connect members to the right opportunities. Early in the year, we acquired Bright and shortly afterwards we began adding open job listings to LinkedIn, targeted to active job seekers and making LinkedIn more attractive to hiring managers. There are now more than 3 million active job listings on LinkedIn, a greater-than 10x increase from a year ago. 
Our long-term goal is to have every available job in the world on LinkedIn. To achieve this, we are expanding on our ability to create better insights for our job-seeking members and ultimately put more relevant job opportunities in front of them. Our mobile jobs app, which we launched last year continues to show strong momentum, with more than a million downloads to date and a four star rating.
The growth of original content on our platform was another strategic priority in 2014, consistent with our goal of having all of the worldâs professionally relevant knowledge accessible through LinkedIn. In February, we introduced the ability to publish long-form content, allowing our members to augment their professional identities with their unique knowledge. 
Upon seeing rapid adoption and meaningful social engagement with these posts, we steadily accelerated the rollout of this functionality. By yearâs end, we made long-form posting available to all 230 million English language members, on our way to eventually making this functionality available to LinkedIn members globally. 
We surpassed more than 1 million long-form posts on the platform, and we recently saw our first week with more than 50,000 new posts. Meanwhile, our roster of hundreds of professional influencers continue to use LinkedIn to deliver compelling content to our members. A few weeks ago, Valerie Jarrett, Senior Advisor to President Obama, turned to LinkedIn to break news of the administrationâs new paid family leave initiatives. Her post has received nearly 400,000 views and thousands of likes, comments and shares.
Rich media also continues to grow on our platform. SlideShare now hosts more than 17 million presentations and videos, demonstrating strong progress toward our goal of making it the largest repository of professional knowledge on the Internet. Increasingly, we are seeing more well-known business influencers such as Eric Schmidt, Arianna Huffington and Suze Orman, use SlideShare to engage an active professional audience that is seeking out deep knowledge on specific subjects.
Expanding LinkedIn internationally has also been a major initiative. In Q4, more than 75% of new members came to LinkedIn from outside the U.S. China, with roughly one in five of the worldâs professionals emerged as a focus in 2014. In February, we launched our local Simplified Chinese version of the platform. Prior to this launch, there were 4 million English-language members in China. Currently, we have more than 8 million members in China. And earlier this quarter, our ICP license application for our local Chinese LinkedIn site was approved.
Creating value for our members enables us to deliver useful offerings to customers of our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions products. These product lines transform the way our customers Hire, Market, and Sell on a global basis. In Q4, Talent Solutions grew 41% to $369 million; Marketing Solutions was up 56% to $153 million; and Premium Subscriptions increased 38% to $121 million.
For Talent Solutions, 2014 was a year of strategic investments in both our flagship Recruiter product and in our field sales team. At our annual Talent Connect conference, we introduced powerful new search capabilities to Recruiter that simplify the experience for hiring managers, as well as tools that help recruiters find the best fit for their particular companies. More broadly, our efforts to add millions of job listings to the platform should provide benefits to both recruiters and hiring managers who are looking to fill open positions with the best active job seekers.
For Marketing Solutions, in 2014 we made progress against two of our key initiatives â the transition to a more scalable content marketing platform, and the creation of a full-funnel end-to-end product portfolio. Sponsored Updates continues to show strong momentum, now accounting for approximately one-third of total Marketing Solutions revenue. 
And with the acquisition and integration of Bizo, we are now ready to relaunch our Marketing Solutions product suite. We believe this will make LinkedIn the most effective integrated platform for marketers to reach, nurture, and acquire professional customers. We are currently in the process of transitioning our global marketing solutions sales force to deliver this new suite at scale.
Within Premium Subscriptions, 2014 saw the simplification of our various member-facing offerings, while investing heavily in our Sales Navigator flagship product. We are off to a strong start with Sales Navigator, which we believe will scale into our third, large vertically-focused product line following Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions.
As we begin 2015, LinkedIn remains focused on our core strategic priorities. For our members, itâs about connecting them to the people, knowledge and opportunities that matter most to them professionally. With regard to helping members build and nurture their professional relationships, weâll continue to invest in our profile and networking functionality on the platform, such as the flagship and Connected applications.
Related to professional knowledge, we are committed to growing our publishing platform, making SlideShare the largest professional content repository on the Internet, and making Pulse the best application for relevant content based on who you are and who you know. And with regard to connecting our members to the right opportunities, weâll continue to make it easier to find the right jobs and get hired through our Jobs application by leveraging the scale and data of our platform.
On the customer side, we remain focused on helping companies hire, market, and sell. In Talent Solutions, we are addressing key unmet needs in the marketplace for hiring managers by simplifying the search experience, streamlining the referral process, and making talent branding more powerful. In Marketing Solutions, we will integrate Bizo into a full-funnel solution that can be used both on and off the LinkedIn network.
For Sales Solutions, weâll continue to educate the market around the power of social selling. In this year, we plan to enter a new category with products allowing companies to utilize LinkedIn in the enterprise by leveraging content and data that members are already sharing publicly. And now, Iâll turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials.
Steve Sordello
Thanks Jeff, Today, I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, and the tax impacts of these adjustments. The fourth quarter underscored a strong 2014 for LinkedIn. We made progress on many of our long-term investments. We ended the year with positive momentum across the business portfolio, ranging from growing organic engagement in our member platform, to strong performance across all three product lines.
As a result, we generated revenue growth consistent with prior quarters, and record levels of non-GAAP net Income and adjusted EBITDA. Specific to LinkedIn members, Jeff highlighted the trend of strengthening organic engagement, driven in particular by the shift to mobile and a richer content experience. We continue to invest in creating a platform that delivers value to members across specific professional use cases.
One example of a key 2014 investment was relevance, an area showing early positive results. The redesigned desktop homepage began gradually ramping in December. Members on the new experience have increased engagement with news, publishing members, and social interactions, driving an approximate 90% increase in social activity. Wins like homepage relevance drive our investment into the member platform, where a stronger member experience expands our long-term monetization potential.
With regard to monetization, revenue totaled $643 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year. Talent Solutions performed well during the yearâs seasonally strong quarter, growing 41% year-over-year to $369 million, and representing 57% of sales versus 58% last year. Field sales comprised 77% of Talent Solutions revenue, and showed continued balance through our land and expand strategy. Pulling forward sales force hiring was a key second half investment, an initiative spanning reps for both customer acquisition and relationship management.
Our conviction to accelerate investment stems from increased visibility into our long-term opportunity, which we outlined in our second quarter results. As a reminder, we see a pipeline for Talent Solutions in excess of $10 billion against the broader $27 billion full-time hiring market. New customer acquisition showed particular strength, even in well-established markets. For example, our large enterprise customers in North America drove more than expected new business, suggesting healthy headroom in more mature regions.
Overall customer growth remained strong, increasing to over 33,000 customers. Business with existing customers was a particular point of strength, driven in our core markets in North America, EMEA, and with global strategic customers. The net ratio saw a strong seasonal uptick, helped in part by record low churn on a global basis. For the full year, the net ratio was essentially flat versus 2013 on a much larger book of business, strength we believe can continue into 2015.
In addition, the online channel generated solid performance. The job seeker subscription showed a meaningful increase in subscribers generated by the new self-serve purchasing experience. At the same time, self-serve jobs showed slower growth, a byproduct of pushing SMB accounts with larger upside into the field channel. Marketing Solutions grew 56% to $153 million, representing 24% of total sales versus 22% last year.
Powered by Sponsored Updates, our core business grew 40% year-over-year, excluding Bizo, an improvement versus last quarter. This is a positive result given the comparison to Q4â13 when Sponsored Updates began fully ramping. The field sales channel generated strong performance on several dimensions, with greater than 20% growth in both spend per customer and total customers.
Also, the number of field sales customers buying multiple products increased by nearly 50%. This dynamic has helped overall desktop display perform in excess of our expectations throughout the year, despite the challenge of slower desktop inventory growth. Sponsored updates across both channels grew 50% quarter over quarter, and well over three times versus last year. Effective pricing increased greater than 40% versus last year as we benefitted from strong click thru rates and growing demand in the auction.
As it relates to Bizo and our broader strategy, during the fourth quarter, Bizo contributed approximately $16 million to Marketing Solutions. The Bizo sales team closed a strong Q4, seeing a pull forward in demand ahead of the re-launch of our product suite. Included in the $16 million was approximately $4 million in data licensing revenue that will be discontinued going forward. 
More importantly, last yearâs Bizo acquisition represented a large step on the Marketing
Solutions strategic roadmap and we are pleased with the progress weâve made against our integration plan. In Q4, we successfully joined our R&D teams to begin development on the re-envisioned product suite, which will launch in coming months. In Q1, we are unifying and training the LinkedIn and Bizo, and ultimately acquire prospects.
Premium Subscriptions grew 38% to $121 million, contributing 19% of revenue compared to 20% last year. As a reminder, we rolled out a simplified buying experience in Q4, reducing SKUs, better educating customers, de-emphasizing email marketing, and standardizing free trials. This drove a small downward revenue impact that we believe will be slightly larger in Q1 given the larger typical seasonal sign-up volume in the first quarter. More importantly, we believe the longer-term impact will increase the lifetime value per subscriber and lift overall revenue. To date, we have seen an increase in the number of new subscribers, and improvement in renewal rates.
Sales Solutions outpaced our expectations in the first full quarter post launch of the flagship Sales Navigator. While the majority of Sales Solutions remains online, field sales showed particularly strong performance as the primary driver behind growth. We have migrated virtually all enterprise customers to the new product and encouragingly, churn has improved versus last year. 
We are seeing strong performance with larger customers on both new customer acquisition as well as renewals. The SAP deal is an example of larger enterprises finding value in social selling. And similar to Talent Solutions, we are seeing the land & expand model take root. Our business continues to become more global. In Q4, international represented 40% of overall revenue versus 39% last year. And by channel, field sales contributed 64% versus 61% last year.
Moving to the non-GAAP financials, revenue outperformance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $179 million, a 28% margin compared to $111 million and 25% margin last year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $71 million while stock-based compensation was $94 million. On taxes, GAAP expense was $4 million with a positive impact from the R&D tax credit, creating a $16 million benefit. Non-GAAP tax expense was $42 million, reflecting the static 35% non-GAAP tax rate implemented in 2014. 
GAAP net income was $3 million, resulting in earnings of $0.02 per share compared to $0.03 last year. As a reminder, GAAP net income now includes a non-cash interest expense related to the convertible offering. The fourth quarter expense was $6 million, and will be approximately $11 million to $12 million per quarter in 2015. Non-GAAP net income was $77 million, resulting in earnings of $0.61 per share compared with $48 million and $0.39 last year.
With respect to the balance sheet, the November convertible offering further strengthened our cash position with minimal dilution and interest, while providing flexibility to invest in our strategic roadmap. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities.
Free cash flow for the full year was $21 million; however, cash flow and CapEx were impacted by approximately $180 million in second half property purchases in Dublin and Silicon Valley. We believe both geographies will help create centralized scale for our employees over the long-term. Without the property acquisitions, free cash flow would have been approximately $200 million in 2014, a positive result considering the level of investment in our self-managed datacenter project and global facilities expansion.
I will end the call with guidance for the first quarter and our initial outlook for 2015. Revenue guidance for 2015 incorporates continued strength in our core business, a growing contribution throughout the year from key strategic initiatives, and the planned transitions in Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions during Q1. For revenue, we expect Q1 to range between $618 million and $622 million, 31% growth at the midpoint. And for the full year, we expect revenue to range between $2.93 billion and $2.95 billion, a 33% annual growth rate at the midpoint. 
First quarter guidance includes the following impacts. We expect approximately $20 million related to Marketing Solutions, as the integration and training of our sales force will push revenue to future quarters. $4 million of this impact also relates to shutting down the Bizo data product. We expect approximately $5 million related to changes in premium subscriptions, slightly more than Q4 given higher seasonality in signups. And finally, we expect approximately $10 million in impact related to the headwind from foreign exchange rate volatility.
As it relates to adjusted EBITDA, we plan to maintain a consistent investment philosophy as in past years where we balance creating scale and efficiency in our core operations with long-term investment towards our strategic roadmap. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect Q1 to range between $152 million and $154 million, a 25% margin at the midpoint. And for the full year, we expect approximately $785 million, a 27% margin, consistent with the level achieved in 2014. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.53 for Q1 and approximately $2.95 for the full year.
Additional guidance inputs include depreciation of $61 million for Q1 and $270 million for the full year; and first quarter amortization of $12 million and $45 million for the full year. Stock based compensation of $103 million for Q1 and approximately $460 million for the full year. Related to our convertible offering, cash interest expense of $2 million per quarter. On a GAAP basis, there is an additional quarterly non-cash interest expense of $11 million to $12 million. 
For GAAP taxes, our ability to forecast remains limited given the level of GAAP pre-tax income, but we anticipate greater than $80 million in tax expense for 2015 given the continued build out of our global business. A non-GAAP tax rate of 25% for Q1 and the full year 2015, the product of a growing international business. The change versus 2014 reflects a rolling long-term forecast that we expect to result in a stable long-term tax rate over the next several years. And finally, fully diluted weighted shares of approximately 128 million for Q1 and 130 million for the full year.
To conclude, 2014 represented a year of both new strategic investments and significant progress against LinkedInâs long-term roadmap. We improved our member experience by investing in mobile, content, and the successful launch in China. Within monetization, we increased investment to pursue the larger market opportunity in Talent Solutions, while laying the foundation for Marketing and Sales Solutions through the acquisition of Bizo and the launch of the flagship Sales Navigator. We will continue to aggressively invest in our member and customer platforms to pursue the vision of building the worldâs first economic graph and realizing LinkedInâs full potential.
Thank you for your time, and we will now take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, [indiscernible] for Doug. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on the level of investment for Sales Navigator this year, your expectation I saw that last year as your sales force issue was ramping. And then also if you could provide anymore color on how different this Marketing Solutions relaunch will be. I know itâs early but anything you can provide would be great. Thanks.
Jeff Weiner
So on the Sales Solutions side in terms of the investment, from a head count perspective in terms of sales people, we ended the year just north of 165 heads with only 165 or 170. Today, we are about 200. We expect to grow that throughout next year by about 80%. So we are still in investment mode in terms of rolling out the sales force as well as continuing to transition the customer base. We are virtually fully transition on the field side, but the online side itâs about 20% transition.
Steve Sordello
In terms of the Marketing Solutions roll out and transition, itâs really adding to our portfolio of Marketing Solutions product. So on the heels of our success with native advertising and sponsored content, this reflects the integration of Bizo and multichannel nurturing so that our Marketing Solutions partners are going to be able to nurture prospects on LinkedIn, off of LinkedIn and thatâs both mobile and desktop. So itâs going to provide a much more robust set of solutions and we are looking forward to bring that to market.
Unidentified Analyst

Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.
Gene Munster
Hi, good afternoon. If you could talk a little bit about the new sea growth at 36% year-over-year, how sustainable is that? I know that your sales forces uncompound [ph] that growth and some broader thoughts on how you should expect that to trend for the year? And separately as CapEx went up dramatically quarter-on-quarter, could you talk a little bit about some of the data, more about the investments that you are making.
Steve Sordello
Sure. I think you are referring to page view growth in terms of the traffic to the side and we have seen continued improvement in user engagement both in terms of unique visitors and page views, both of those accelerated in the quarter. Page view is from 28% to 34% as you mentioned. We are seeing I think good returns on some of the earlier investments in content. We talked about the publishing platform and the homepage growing at a material faster rate than the rest of the site as well as mobile. Mobile is now approaching 50% of our unique visitors, so investments in those two areas have been driving growth. 
I think looking forward, I think we expect it to continue to grow in a healthy manner, not necessarily accelerate as we continue into 2015 of very healthy levels, but we continue to be somewhat stable. 
In terms of the CapEx, we are currently â this last quarter weâre influenced by a couple of large investments in purchases of land. If you strip those out, we are running somewhere in the 17% revenue level in terms of CapEx and I would say for 2015 expect around that level may be slightly higher. We are investing in a number of areas. The self managed data center is one that we have talked about previously. We are planning on launching a third one this year on international basis and possibly a fourth in addition to continuing with some pretty significant facility build outs. So those two areas from a CapEx perspective are keeping it in that high teen range.
Gene Munster
Excellent. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jim Lee with CLSA.
James Lee
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Relating to China, now you getting to ICP license, besides being able to put service on the ground, just wondering what this allow you to do? And also secondly, I think you guys recently appointed a new Government Relations Officer. Iâm just curious what his background was and what youâre hoping to achieve with this appointment? Thank you so much.
Jeff Weiner
So with regard to China license, itâs been â this is usual. That was always a part of our plan that we continue to execute. There is still a lot of work to be done, but we have always talked about our focus on putting the right team in place and we are very fortunate to have built a really talented group there in china. 
Most recently, we added a Head of Engineering in China, so we are looking forward to more localized development efforts there. We had a good 12 months in terms of membership growth doubling the number of members from 4 million to 8 million, and weâre going to be continue to focus on the team and getting the product right in delivering the right number value.
In terms of government relations, I think youâre referring to Pablo Chavez who has been with us for roughly a year now and Pablo has been a wonderful addition to our team. And he is not focused specifically on China, he works on government relations on a global basis but we are very fortunate to have him here.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo.
Peter Stabler
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, one for Jeff and one for Steve. Jeff, certified developer programs appear to be really successful for some of your large social platform competitors. Wonder if you could offer some thoughts on the importance there and may be any plans to expand it? It seems fairly limited at the current time.
And then Steve, wondering if you could just give us a snapshot on currency. What the impact was in the quarter and then what youâre baking-in in terms of expectations for full year 2015. Thanks very much.
Jeff Weiner
So with regard to our platform plan and certified developers, weâre going to be getting increasingly focused on specific used cases for developers. So for example, with regard to our Marketing Solutions efforts, API that facilitate third party social media marketing agencies to create more value for their customers and our customers. And we have a number of vertical areas where we think we have similar opportunities.
With regard to our general API program, we want to get as focused as possible on the things that make the most sense for multiple constituents within the ecosystem. So a great example of that would be our in share buttons and the ability to share content from third party sites. So I think going forward, the best way to characterize it would be greater clarity and weâll be much more explicit about our objectives by vertical.
Steve Sordello
And in terms of currency, I think one of the factors in our business is the consideration that 40% of our business is international, but over 70% of the total business is in U.S.D. So that somewhat mitigates it and we are also a ratable business, so the quarter to quarter volatility is there, itâs more of a deferred volatility. In the past itâs been nominal and in Q4 less than 1% impact on revenue, Iâm sorry in Q4 less than 1% impact on revenue, in Q1 we are predicting less than 2%, and for the year somewhere between 1% and 2% impact, there could be greater variability but thatâs what weâre projecting at this time.
Peter Stabler
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
Dan Salmon
Hi guys good afternoon. Jeff I just wanted to ask a little bit about the LinkedIn Corporate Solutions customer number for the quarter because you saw nice acceleration again and I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around that, what may be some of the drivers are as the international numbers starting to pick up if Sales Navigators are opening some new doors, particularly against the context of a little bit more emphasis on expanding rather than landing that seems like a pretty positive figure.
A â Steve Sordello
Yes this is Steve. So, we did have a healthy quarter both in terms of new business and existing business. On the new side, nearly 3000 customers, a good number of those came from the more established companies in some of the larger markets, which is a good sign in terms of there continuing to be headroom, so that was very positive. 
Weâre also obviously continuing to expand more and more deeply into S&B in terms of the number of accounts, one of the good phenomenonâs thatâs been happening over the prior quarters is despite that longer tail being reached are [indiscernible] able to maintain that near record level and thatâs due to the fact that we continue to also sell into our exiting account base bigger deals and so thatâs been a healthy rate. 
Our net ratio has been strong in terms of add-ons and renewals net of churn. This last quarter churn was a record low as weâve focused and that really was mainly in North America and EMEA in the larger accounts. So, I think itâs been pretty broad based. We also in the Q3 timeframe started to accelerate a little more investment in terms of sales on the hunter side as we did the work in terms of the visible pipeline and saw a larger opportunity. So, that had a moderate impact in the quarter, but good performance overall.
Q â Dan Salmon
And then maybe just one quick follow-up you mentioned that Sales Navigator came in above expectations in the quarter, is there any color you can provide around maybe the level of promotional activity whether thatâs three months to start things like that and how the â it sounds like a fairly positive demand environment may reflect that as 2015 goes on.
A â Steve Sordello
Yes, what I would say is, weâve been continuing to focus on the migration particularly on the field sales side, most of the growth has come on the field sales side. I think weâre making good progress in some of the larger accounts. SAP was an example. This is a little longer of a sales cycle given of the higher volume type of proposition than talent solutions, but we felt good about the performance. In terms of the business side, this is a ratable recognition. So, this is something that is going to build over time. 
And today we are very much still focused on continuing to improve the product, continuing to educate the customer on social selling and how to best utilize the product in addition to the selling portion of going to market. In terms of â so thatâs kind of a high level takeaway, you know positive results so far still in early stages of its life cycle.
Q â Dan Salmon
Great, thank you Steve.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitz of Jefferies.
Q â Brian Fitzgerald
Thanks. As you talk to clients about Sales Navigator, can you give us a sense for some of the feedback on how differentiated the product is versus competitors and what are the unique data assets that LinkedIn actually has, I can really further enhance Sales Navigator for clients, thanks.
A â Jeff Weiner
So the primary point of differentiation is actually related to the second part of your question, it is the data. So, by virtue of our membership representing their identity to the world we understand who they are, their role, their experience increasingly those individuals are sharing their professionally relevant knowledge which provides a really strong in for somebody looking to build a relationship with that prospect. So, I think the available data, I think beyond the data is the insight that is generated from that data. 
So, understanding when someone switches jobs when they are promoted into a new role, so that they become the decision maker within an organization where the sales person needs to reach out to. Sometimes itâs the little things like being notified when itâs worth reaching out to someone to congratulate them on something in particular, helps to nurture that relationship. So, it really runs this section, but I think the key point of differentiation is related to our data.

Jeff in your prepared remarks I think you mentioned new product categories, Iâm just curious as to what this is and also do you guys mentioned good returns on content presumably youâre talking about the publishing platform and the influencers, have you been able to see any sort of traffic benefits from scaling the job listing for 3 million, okay thanks.
A â Jeff Weiner
Yes, with regard to the new product category, I think youâre talking about some of our enterprise efforts and with regard to the enterprise I would start by saying, with regard to higher marketing sales we already have enterprise products. Our recruiter is really enterprise products Sales Navigatorâs and enterprise product. The way in which companies are interacting with our company profile in LinkedIn and then administrating those products and services, to some extent thatâs an enterprise product. 
What I was referring to in the prepared remarks is that we think increasingly there is an opportunity for LinkedIn to create value within an enterprise within an organization leveraging information thatâs already public. So, by way of example our public profile information, which particularly in larger organizations you see some of those companies turning to LinkedIn to look up someone within their own company because of how robust that public profile information can prove to be. So, there is examples of content or information thatâs already publically available and weâre trying to thing about ways in which we can better leverage that to create value within an organization. 
I think similarly there is also opportunity to facilitate the way in which employees are sharing news and content, not only with one another, but externally in service of things like higher market and sales. And weâve got some interesting things that weâve been working on that weâre looking forward to continuing the test and experiment and hopefully roll that out and create value in that regard. 
With regard to the comments you mentioned, part of your question on the publishing platforms impact on traffic, yes, I do think our investments there in the expansion of the publishing platform from â at first 500 influences to now north of 230 million members have certainly made a difference. And we are hoping that similarly our investment in job liquidity will be making a difference as well, particularly in developing economies. You know market like India for example is we can create more job liquidity in a market like that. We are hoping to generate more value for our membership, particularly the younger demographic.

Justin Post
Hi, congrats on a great quarter. Can you hear me?
A â Jeff Weiner
Yes, thank you.
A â Steve Sordello
Thank you.
Justin Post
Actually, can you please update us with any large customers wins such as SAP for a Sales Navigator category and also I was wondering what is the Sales Navigator revenue as a percent of three month subscription revenue, I think it was roughly 25% last quarter?
A â Steve Sordello
Yes, we did announce SAP in the quarter and as I mentioned where we are seeing some success is in working with some of the larger accounts both in terms of renewals and add-ons. And the goal is for SAP to be an example of what can become on a greater scale and so no media announcements on that side, but we feel good about the momentum that we are seeing. In terms of the revenue as a percentage of premium subscriptions, yes, last quarter was roughly 25% this quarter it is approaching 30%. Again, this is a business that will fill gradually over time.
Q â Justin Post
Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Kerry Rice of Needham & Co.
Q â Kerry Rice
Thanks a lot. To go back to marketing solutions and maybe the expansion of the publishing platform, can you talk a little bit about maybe the dynamics there as it relates to maybe providing additional inventory that you can advertise on and if there is any impact to CPMs, I know that a lot times you sell out on the field sell side and so I was curious if you are even running advertising against maybe some of the long form publishing and then the second question is just beyond the hiring additional sales people, beyond China too â can you talk about other ways you think about monetizing the international markets. Thanks.
A â Jeff Weiner
So, with regard to the relationship between the publishing platform and inventory, the vast majority of the inventory thatâs been sold for the purpose of sponsored content has been in our feed both desktop and mobile, mobile actually comprises the majority of that. So thatâs where that is focused.
In terms of the publishing platform and additional inventory, we are excited about the potential there but itâs still early and we want to make sure that we continue to invest in getting those platform right, those capabilities right. One thing he didnât mentioned that I would certainly include in the mix with regard to future inventory creation through content would be SlideShare. 
And SlideShare has roughly 17 million unique and that we feel has very strong potential going forward, over 17 million presentations and videos have been created to date. And thus far, we havenât really been as focused there in terms of monetization utilizing SlideShare as a source of potential Marketing Solutions inventory.
So with regard to international and monetization opportunities, I think itâs going to be very consistent across the business lines that weâve been making progress on in the U.S. So higher market and sell and thatâs both through our field channel efforts and through Self-Service.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you. Itâs Brian on for Mark. Following up on the Sponsored Updates question, are you seeing any evidence that positive, auction dynamics are starting to kick-in or improve? And then if you could provide an update regarding the number of advertisers on the platform and possibly highlight the strength youâre seeing with any particular industry vertical.
Jeff Weiner
Yeah, on the Sponsored Updates side, we are continuing to see marketers adopt content marketing over the course of last year in terms of the auction it is developing. I think thatâs showing in terms of the improvement of eCPM which were up about 40% year-on-year. So it continues to build.
Our advertisers continue to grow and I think the last number we have roughly 5,000 advertisers on the Marketing Solutions side that fluctuates here and there, and the fourth quarter is seasonally strong on active basis. So that continues to build nicely. And another healthy dynamic we saw in the last couple of quarters is the spend for advertiser increasing nicely.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge of Cowen.
John Blackledge
Great. Thanks. With the field sales people ramping for Sales Navigator in 2015, can you just remind us how long it takes for them to get up and running from their start date? And is Sales Navigator being sold to enterprises globally at this point. And just thoughts on the TAM for Sales Navigator in terms of total global people and/or a dollar amount for the opportunity. Thanks.
Jeff Weiner
Yeah. So in terms of the ramp time, it varies on average I would say six to nine months on average. In terms of the global opportunity, we havenât â this is still a relatively nascent piece of our business, so we havenât really published a lot in terms of the TAM. What I would say is, we started to look at it from our internal dimensions of the visible pipeline that we see similar to Talent Solutions, and so roughly a similar number which is around $10 billion opportunity based on our members and the network.
John Blackledge
Thank you.
Jeff Weiner
Okay. With that, thatâs going to conclude this quarterâs call. Thank you so much for your time and we look forward to talking next quarter. Take care.
