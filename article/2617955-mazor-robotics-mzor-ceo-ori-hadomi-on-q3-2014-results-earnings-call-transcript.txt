With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer. Ori?
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael. I want to thank everyone for joining us to review our 2014 third quarter results. I would like to begin by reviewing the highlights of the quarter and then I will spend a few minutes outlining the market environment and our growth trends.
We are pleased to report that in the quarter we sold five Renaissance systems. All of the systems was sold in the U.S. market and it makes it the best ever quarterly performance in the U.S. One of these systems included the recently launched Brain Module, which continue to garner increased interest from surgeons and hospital administrators.
Additionally, two of our current users upgraded to the Brain Module, so causing our four active Renaissance systems being utilized for both brain and spine procedures. So with that, let me begin with the details on our Renaissance system sales. The first system sale â the first system was sold to St. Mary's Medical Center, which is located in San Francisco representing the first Renaissance in the Northern California region.
With more than 400 private rooms on St. Mary's, itâs the longest continually running hospital in San Francisco and has a reputation for using advanced medical practices including pioneering spine surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation program to ensure a positive patient experience.
The second system was sold to Spine Specialist of Michigan, a modern facility that utilize the latest technology in spine care. The third system was sold to OakBend Medical Center, an independent community hospital, located in the Greater Houston metropolitan area and this sale increased the number of Renaissance systems in the Houston markets to five. This success demonstrates the effectiveness of our cluster strategy, as hospitals need to purchase a Renaissance system to remain competitive and ensure surgeons continue to perform procedures in their facilities.
The fourth system was sold to Forest Park Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. These hospitals pride itself for pioneering procedures in virtually every surgical discipline and also use advanced robotic technology to enhance the patient experience. This increased the number for Renaissance systems in the Dallas area and Texas to 2 and 10 respectively.
Finally, the fifth system was sold to Morton Plant Hospital, a 700-bed hospital located in Clearwater, Florida. This system was sold with a Brain Module and increases the number of Renaissance systems in Florida to nine.
Looking at the distribution of the sales, I'm encouraged that we created new markets to drive future revenue opportunity and deepened our presence in existing markets.
And now, a few words about the new Brain Module which is generating increased interests among new customers, but also among existing customers. The first of the two upgrades was from Littleton Adventist Hospital, which is in the greater Denver metropolitan market. As you may recall, this still required a Renaissance system a year ago, primarily for brain and was one of the test sites before the commercial launch. It has now upgraded the Renaissance to offer both spine and brain surgeries to its patients.
The second upgrade was sold to Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville, Florida. Baptist is clearly a believer in Renaissance system. Itâs one of three hospitals in the U.S. with two Renaissance systems driven by surgeons demand to avoid all of scheduling conflicts. It was also one of the test sites for the Brain Module. We believe this is a very exciting development for Mazor there has been over 50 brain procedures performed today using the Renaissance.
As we had said previously, we anticipate the Brain Module will be used mainly for Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS. DBS procedures are currently used mainly to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson disease. However there are other indications and this novel treatment is being researched for other indications and we expect continuous growth in this segment. We have priced the Brain Module at $129,000, bring the total system lease price for both brain and spine models to almost $1 million.
However, hospitals can still purchase the system with only one model, but it is spine or brain at $849,000 lease price. The success to-date and increased interest in the Brain Module demonstrate our ability to develop additional application for the Renaissance, expanding the addressable market for the system.
In looking at the financial highlights we reported revenues of $6.1 million, almost double last yearâs third quarter revenue of $3.1 million. Revenue from disposable, service, and other, in the third quarter was $2.5 million, which is 67% increase over the year-ago quarter, demonstrating the clinical utilization is continuing to grow. System utilization is a leading indicator and over the long term we believe it will implant new classes to purchase the Renaissance to achieve similar clinical and economic value.
To-date Renaissance has been used in over 9,000 cases placing over 60,000 implants. An encouraging factor is increased average per account due to the wide distribution of the procedure volume between more surgeons. Overall, we ended the quarter with 77 systems installed globally including 44 U.S. systems in 41 accounts, compared to 30 systems a year ago, representing 46% increase.
In the U.S., we estimate the addressable market for Renaissance including surgery centers to be between 2,200 to 2,400 facilities. So our penetration rate is just under 2%. As I mentioned in the last call our target audience includes the for-profit Accountable Care Organizations and I firmly believe Renaissance address each of their needs, because it delivers better patient outcome, lower the cost of healthcare and improve the hospitalâs financial profile. As a result we have more clinical interest than ever, which is reflected in site visits, case observations and attendance in Bioskills Labs.
Surgeons are engaged and they are demanding that their administrators purchase the Renaissance system. As we discussed on the last call â on the last conference call in August, the decision making process on the part of the hospital administration has become longer for Mazor and other capital equipment purchases. Despite these challenge we have a strong pipeline and to convert these into system sales, we recently implemented a number of strategies to meet these objectives.
The first of these growth strategies is increasing our interaction with hospital administrators and assessing the level of interest during each stage of the first quarter so we can achieve better clarity as to the timing of their decision. Second, we are focused on extending our footprint into the major metropolitan area. I believe our results in this quarter adding Detroit and San Francisco are good example of this commitment.
The third step involves greater participation of the clinical sales team in the sales process. The presence and involvement with surgeons and administrators who are already using the Renaissance system allows them to identify potential new revenue opportunities. This includes selling an additional system to a current user or it was during the first quarter the clinical team identified the current Renaissance user, who wanted access to the system at another site resulting in the sale.
The fourth step involves the expansion of the capital sales team. We continue to recruit talented and experienced capital sales team members and our record pipeline reflect their effort. We expect to convert this into system sales in the coming quarter. Although we should caution that the length of the time it takes to get new team members to be productive in capital sales can take several quarters, so growth should be viewed as a long-term investment rather than an action that should yield immediate results.
In the fifth actionable item is enhancing our presence at key industry events and conferences. On this method, there will be three podium presentations at this yearâs NASS annual meeting in San Francisco. The presenters are Dr. Faissal Zahrawi from Florida, a leading minimal invasive spine surgeon; Dr. (inaudible) from the Netherland; and Dr. Sam Bederman from UC Irvine.
Their presentation will highlight the clinical value of using Mazorâs technology, its high accuracy and referred usability of the pre-operative plan in the breadth of cases from primary surgeries to revision cases. I believe our refined sales and marketing approach increase our opportunity to generate long-term growth in the U.S. Market. And to assure these efforts or execute it flawlessly and to maintain our focus, we recently promoted Chris Prentice to be the CEO of our U.S. business. Chris has been with us since 2010 and his numerous contributions to our U.S. growth strategy have been critical to our success. We look forward to his continued contribution and leadership.
Now, let me discuss our international effort, we achieved a significant milestone as received clearance to sell the Renaissance system in China. We are working with our Chinese distribution partner Cicel to penetrate this key market, one of our large opportunities in Asia. We have a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific market with systems and distribution partners in Taiwan, India, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong. For this region continues to be an exciting growth opportunity for Mazor.
We believe the active discussions in these markets are result in system sales. On the R&D side, we recently launched a new enhancement focused on improving the system performance and customersâ experience. We always continue to focus our resources to ensure our long-term competitiveness and market leadership.
In summary, we had a solid quarter and we are encouraged by the level of activity in our sales pipeline. We anticipate building on this momentum in the U.S. and internationally. We believe the data supporting the clinical and economic benefits of the Renaissance system along with the continued increase in customer utilization will drive great adoption and expand Renaissanceâs global installed base.
And as I said earlier, we are still in the very early stages of penetrating the market in which we are active, and we are looking forward to continued growth in the future.
Now to review the financial highlights of the quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori, and hello everyone. I will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Revenue for the quarter was $6.1 million, a strong increase over the $3.1 million in the year-ago third quarter. Geographically revenue in the U.S. was $5.4 million or 89% of total revenue, $6.7 million or 11% of revenue from international markets.
Capital sales revenue increased to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2013. Reflecting five systems sold compared to the year ago period, when we sold two systems and one system upgrade.
Revenue from disposable kits sales service and other, totaled $2.5 million, 67% increase compared to $1.5 million in last yearâs third quarter, reflecting the increase in installed base as well as great (inaudible) innovation of the system. Gross margin for the quarter expanded to 80.6% compared to 73.2% in the last yearâs third quarter. The gross margin expansion is primarily due to the higher sales volumes in the quarter compared with the comparable quarter in last year. Gross margin in the 2014 second quarter was 79%.
Operating expense were $8.4 million compared to $5.8 million in the year-ago third quarter. The increase is due to our continued investment in sales, marketing, and research and development. On a GAAP basis the net loss for the third quarter was $3.9 million or $0.09 per share compared to net loss of $3.5 million or $0.10 per share in 2013 third quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis the net loss for the period was $3.2 million or $0.08 per share compared to $3.1 million or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Cash used in operating activities in the third quarter was $4 million above the $2 million in the last yearâs third quarter of 2013. The increase in cash used for operating activities reflects the company efforts to raise awareness of its Renaissance system, in addition to continued research and development to maintain its leadership position.
As of September 30, 2014 cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and long-term investments totaled $54.2 million, which provides internal resource to execute our business plans.
That concludes my remarks. Thank you again for joining the call. Operator we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.

Okay. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.
Ori Hadomi
Good morning, Jeff.
Sharon Levita
Good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Sharon. Could you talk about this $7.237 million in long-term investments on the balance sheet basis?
Sharon Levita
Yes. This is cash that has a little bit longer range, some deposits, which has longer periods.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Okay. Could you talk a little bit about the anticipated data, thatâs being worked on or any studies that you know of or any data that we should see prior to or into NASS presentations that you mentioned?
Ori Hadomi
What you â the clinical studies and control studies that we are running we just initiating in this early days, as I mentioned about two months ago. So I donât expect any real result before next year. The types of the results that will be presented are based on studies that deal surgeon needs independently on their site, and will describe the results of using the system in both simple and complex cases including revisions and primary surgeries.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Okay. Will any of that be related to any economic analysis?
Ori Hadomi
I donât know to tell you â I donât know to tell you in advance. This is their presentations from the abstract that they submitted. I didnât see reference to economic data.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Okay. Could you provide anymore or any data as far as the $2.5 million of revenue as far as number of procedures, number of disposables used, service revenue, any metrics specific to that as far as procedures or utilization that you can provide?
Ori Hadomi
As you know, Jeff, we published our utilization from the U.S. on an annual base in the first quarter. And we â and also then we report about the U.S. utilization, excluding the international as we donât have a real control in the utilization in international, because we sell to distributors and often times they buy for bulk.
So we need to wait another quarter and during the first quarter to report about the average utilization. We donât have right now any additional datas that we are reporting about specific utilization or average utilization. We do see that we are able to maintain very high level of utilization, but the exact numbers in the average, we will report on an annual basis.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Okay. But is it safe to say, at least, domestically that utilization for the third quarter was approximately what it was in the second quarter or the first quarter?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, yes.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Okay. And lastly if I may, could you â I know youâre probably sick of this question over and over, could you talk about the backlog or a funnel as it stands now and how Q4 looks as it related to last year, as well as the first two quarters of 2014?
Ori Hadomi
You just asked a question, and I used to give the answer. And you can talk to â I feel where there is so much more activity and interest in the market than what weâre used in the past. I also feel and see that we walk in different way. We try to engage and to get (inaudible) from the hospitals much earlier along the quarter. One of the reasons why along the previous quarters, there was a very, very lack of clarity and uncertainty for many of the decisions where it goes to the very, very last week and sometimes the last day of the quarter and still it was delayed.
So with using different methods in different ways in order to incentivize the hospitals to make the decision earlier and itâs not to make the decision which is to communicate to us â with us earlier with the administration. So without going deep into the number of the sales, I can say that the numbers they (inaudible) out now and the level of engagement and the discussions and the depth of engagement by â this mean by proving to hospitals which is involved, to what extent legal, operation, marketing, CEOs are engaged in both in the discussions, I'm very encouraged.
However, I still want to wait and see how things will progress and mature, and will be translated to close deals and related to utilization. So I believe itâs still too early to give indication about the results, but I can say that still the level of activity and the type of process today we see both in the West as well as in the East, of course, is very encouraging.
Jeffrey Cohen â Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc.
Perfect. Thanks very much for taking our questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Young Xuyang Li â Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good morning. This is Young Li in for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking our questions. So first question is, so we've seen some encouraging results this quarter in hospital capital as well as robotics, we understand that the hospital capital environment is lumpy and one quarter doesnât make a trend, but are you seeing that from the hospitals as well?
Ori Hadomi
Again, I think that it would be â I wouldnât make conclusions from the sale â a general conclusion from a sale of our five systems. After all statistically, I wouldnât think that this represent market trends. However, from the team that is in the markets, from the level of interest and from the process and the task interaction that we have and holding with hospitals, we definitely see â I would say a good encouraging dynamic.
But as I told â as I said earlier, I think that we are too small in the market in order to be used as an indicator to changing â to the changes in dynamics in the capital market â in the hospital capital market.
Young Xuyang Li â Barclays Capital, Inc.
Sure, understood. And last quarter you carved out a longer selling cycle for the capital sales, and a lot of the other robotic companies have carved out that as well. Are there any changes in the quarter relating to that type of trend?
Ori Hadomi
I â we discussed this here internally. I would say that anecdotally, I think that this quarter found sales â the sale cycle was much shorter than in the past. However, from out of the sales deals we were working on this more than a year. So if I need to give you a kind of a general guideline, I wouldnât think the sales cycle being significantly shortened. Thatâs what I can say.
Young Xuyang Li â Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, got it. Thanks. And I guess another question, so you mentioned that I guess last quarter that the Affordable Care Act might have had some impact on hospital admins being more hesitant when making capital decisions. And I guess in the quarter after the act is implemented some of the other companies are seeing some initial signs of impact from ACA, such as slightly higher volumes. But I guess, from your end, are you seeing any changes to the decision-making process by the hospital admins?
Ori Hadomi

Not yet. I canât say that weâll see any significant change. I think that hospitals are adopting into the new environment and new rules. They become more and more efficient, but itâs not in the way that I can say we see a major change or any kind of major improvement shortened of the process. I believe that they are taking lot of steps and you may expect this type of processes in these organizations sometime takes it time.
Young Xuyang Li â Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Ori Hadomi

Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
Thanks. I guess I had a couple of questions on the International business. And there werenât any international system sales this quarter. Iâm just wondering if you could comment on that. Is that just sort of the normal lumpiness of the business or is there something else going on?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. Hi, Mike. Thank you for this question. No, I wouldnât make any conclusion from this, thereâs definitely the lumpiness and definitely the kind of the sales cycle in different territories. And the fact that we sell to distributors who have much less control in the process, we work indirectly and often times what we know is what we hear from a distributor. We do try to travel a lot to the markets and spend time with the distributors in the market.
I spend time last quarter in few markets in India. And learnt a lot and was actually came back very encouraged by the opportunity. But I wouldnât make any conclusion from the fact that this quarter there were no sales in the international. I am very encouraged and happy with the five sales in the U.S. and I do expect that later on this year and next year we will see also continued sales coming from the international markets.
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
Okay. And then, in China just wondering, it seems like â itâs obviously a huge market. So it seems to me that the sales could ramp pretty quickly there, but would you agree with that or what do you expect the sales or the adoption I guess to look like in China?
Ori Hadomi
Right. I wouldnât â I donât want to set expectations of any fast growth of sales in any new territory. I believe that when you enter new territory it takes time. You need to put the seeds in the ground to water them and to wait sometime. China is a huge country with great opportunity but also with very different culture and very different type of sales cycle and sales methods. I feel that we have a very good partner and I am satisfied with the way they let us through the regulatory process and the introduction to few leading hospitals. I do expect to see the first sales next year.
But I donât want to set expectation that China is in the near term a fast-growing engine. Because from my experience every territory when you enter it takes time to make the first steps.
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
Okay, thanks. And then, can you just update us on the numbers of capital and procedural reps that you had as of the end of the third quarter?
Ori Hadomi
The number of capital and clinical reps that we have in the markets?
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
In the U.S., yes, thatâs correct.
Ori Hadomi
Okay. So we have 18 team members in our capital sales team. Three of them are Senior Directors and 15 are Area Sales Managers. And then to the clinical sales team, we have almost 40 in the market. Some of them been recently hired and some are more experienced.
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
Okay. And then, last question just on NASS. So I know you talk about the three podium presentations. But I was wondering if you could maybe describe what else you got planned for NASS. I mean, are you going to be doing any training there or do you have any kind of events planned for physicians, speakers at your booth, et cetera?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, we have basically all what you mentioned. Weâll have a booth. We even have a cadaver lab and surgeons already registered for training and hands-on training in the cadaver lab. Weâll have all the speakers in the booth and weâll have a lot of visits in the booth. So you are very welcome to come over and see the activity there.
Mike Matson â Needham & Company
All right. Thanks a lot.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Sharon Levita

Thank you.
