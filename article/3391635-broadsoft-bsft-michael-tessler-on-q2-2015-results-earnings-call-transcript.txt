Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, John. Good morning and thank you for taking the time to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. In the first half of the year we delivered strong financials further extended our market leaderships position and executed against our strategic objectives that we had outlined on our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call.
I want to take some time now to look back on our achievements in the first half and also look forward to our remaining goals for the rest of the year. As you recall back in February, we talked about several key initiatives for the year. These were a differentiated end to end user experience, BroadCloud growth, sell-through promotion and network transformation project.
First, on user experience, we mentioned this as a key theme for 2015 and a differentiator for us. Let me spend more time today providing some details. Our goal is to provide a superior, unified communications user experience. What's required to deliver this is an easy-to-use, intuitive, front-end interface and importantly one that seamlessly integrate with a world-class, back-end, unified communications platform. Our recent acquisition of mPortal demonstrates our commitment to user experience. The company designs and develops rich, high-quality customer experiences across mobile, Web and other connected devices. We made the acquisition the foundation of a newly formed team, which we call BroadSoft Design.
BroadSoft Design is a high value-added solutions group who's mandated to enable service providers and enterprises to customize and differentiate their own unified communications offers that are built around the functionality of BroadSoft's UC-One platform and other complementary third-party services or applications. Our goals for design to be both a driver of services-related revenue in itself, but more importantly, enabler of greater differentiation for our customers and sell-through for BroadWorks and BroadCloud.
BroadSoft Design is differentiated due to several factors. First, the team has telecom, mobile, Internet and online domain expertise which is critical in dealing with the stringent requirements of the world's largest service providers. Second, its philosophy focuses on individual (05:31) requirements first, and then works back the right solution rather than the other way around. Third, it delivers turnkey solutions to a strong development services team that can take an additional concept all the way through product development and delivery.
In combination with BroadSoft's core software and cloud solutions, BroadSoft Design is truly one-stop shop for delivering superior end-user experiences. To make this a bit more concrete, let me give you an example of what's possible. The Design team creates an entire customer care e-commerce application for a service provider, so customers can easily self-serve to check their balances online and even order new unified communication services, because UC-One functionalities embedded within the app during the ordering process. A customer simply clicks to open up a voice or even video call with the service representative within the application itself.
Let me close this topic by saying that while it's still early, there's a lot of excitement from our customers about what BroadSoft design can do for them, and we're already in discussions with them about a number of different project opportunities.
On BroadCloud, let me share some of our progress. We are continuing to focus on building our BroadCloud customer base, which means adding more customers to a platform, and making our existing customers more successful. Our BroadCloud offer continues to be in demand by service providers, small and large, as many service providers look to quickly launch new unified communications services.
Here are some recent highlights. At the end of June, we had over 200,000 total subscribers. Of those, there were 160,000 wholesale subs, up from 130,000 we noted at the end of Q4 2014. In addition, we have over 45,000 retail subscribers and are poised to have service in Germany. In Q2 we on-boarded another Tier 1 customer, which is currently in the process of rolling out services to their end customers.
On sell-through, we continue to see strong sell-through of hosted and trunking in the first half of the year, demonstrating the momentum of the market and the success that our customers are having with our platform. In fact, Q2 represented the highest quarterly sell-through for host in our history, and trunking sell-through was strong as well. At this point our five largest hosted customers in aggregate now deliver services to nearly 3.5 million business subscribers on their BroadSoft platforms.
We believe that some of the success of our customers sell-through is directly attributed to the work of our channel acceleration and go-to-market teams who works side by side with our customers' sales channels to help them create and market their offers.
On network transformation, on a number of earlier calls we discussed the concept of network transformation, which are projects in which we transform a service providers' existing business and consumer fixed and mobile subscribers from legacy platforms to BroadSoft. To give some color on the benefits of these transformation projects, I want to share with you the work we are doing at an international cable operator. This is a win we haven't mentioned in the past, but it's an interesting one as we've been selected as the go-forward unified communications platform for the enterprise customers.
We've also been asked to transform their 2 million fixed residential lines on to BroadWorks. In Q2, we successfully completed a migration of 75% of those lines and our customer was able to shut down one of their two legacy VoIP platforms. We expect to finish the rest of the migration by the end of this year. We believe that our success in this one project will allow us to expand our relationship with the service provider to more of their operations in other countries.
Lastly, I want to share some of the things we've heard from customers in our recent interactions with them. As a strategic and trusted partner to many of them, our dialogs always have some give and take. Our customers appreciate our thoughts on overall market dynamics and trends, given our bird's eye view of the market. And we got the benefit from hearing about the goals and challenges of our customers.
We've heard a number of common themes from these conversations. For example, the ability of their unified communications platform to scale and offer breadth and depth of services is critical. A robust cloud service that has offered in major geographies and then poured success factor for us and our service provider customers. The focus on mobile end user experience and customization continues to grow. Defining our vision for the unified communications roadmap and the evolution of unified communications into the workflow and work processes is growing in importance. And finally, the go to market repositioning by other industry players is creating a concern amongst service providers and plays well into our tight relationship with them. These themes align with our vision and gives us confidence that we are executing on the right strategic direction.
In summary, we had another strong quarter and look forward to updating you on the progress in the months to come. With that, let me now hand the call over to Jim who'll go through our results. Afterwards, I'll be happy to answer any questions. Jim?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report strong Q2 and first half of the year results. Let me run through the Q2 headlines. Total revenue was $64.5 million, up 23% from the year ago quarter. Billings which we define as revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue were $70.8 million, up 20% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.32 versus $0.28 in the year ago period. We had one 10% customer in the quarter.
Software license revenue was $30 million, up 17% year-over-year. Software license billings were $32 million, up 9% year-over-year. We had another solid hosted UC quarter. This was especially gratifying given a tough comp with Q2 of last year. You may recall that in Q2 2014 we had a sizable EMEA transformational software billings event.
Trunking and consumer billings were up year-over-year with the growth in consumer partially driven by consumer VoLTE billings. We also had strong billings growth in North America and APAC and emerging markets partially offset by a decline in EMEA due to that tough transformational comp.
Our subscription and maintenance support revenue was $27 million, up 23% year-over-year. Of that revenue, maintenance support revenue of $18 million was up 14% year-over-year.
Cloud SaaS revenue of $8.5 million grew about 50% year-over-year and from $8.1 million in Q1 2015. SaaS did grow a bit more slowly than we had expected this quarter. And I think we will also be a little light in Q3. We haven't had the uptick we expected from new carrier implementations. But I think we will exit the year very strongly, driven by acceleration with our existing major SaaS customers.
Professional services and other revenue of $7 million was up 51% year-over-year. This growth in PS is being driven by these large transformational deals we've discussed in the past. Given the timing of revenue recognition milestones related to several of these deals, we expect continued strength in PS revenues in the second half of the year.
Now, moving on to costs and margins. In Q2, we had gross margin of 75%, down a point from the year ago quarter. Gross margin for both software and subscription and maintenance support improved year-over-year.
Within subscription and maintenance support, BroadCloud margins in Q2 were in the mid-30% range. We saw a bit of margin compression for our SaaS business, a combination of investing in current geographies and in new geographic expansion, and SaaS revenue a bit below our expectations.
Overall margins were impacted by the SaaS gross margin, as well as the decline in professional services and other margins to 16% from 27% a year ago. Remember that we expense all of our professional services cost in period while revenue may be deferred. Our acquisition of mPortal as well as the continued investment in our existing services organization drove the increase in professional services cost of sales.
Unusual for us, we also resold about $600,000 of hardware at the request of a specific transformational customer which negatively impacted margins. We expect that over a multi-quarter period, our professional services gross margin will average in the mid-30% range. For Q3, we expect that overall cost of sales will increase by $1.5 million to $2 million versus Q2. This reflects not just a full quarter's worth of mPortal expense, but continued investment in professional services as well as additional hardware resells to that customer.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled nearly $38 million and operating margin was 16% versus 18% a year ago. Operating expenses were up over $3 million sequentially over Q1. We did have some costs in Q2 that were non-run rate in nature, including over $1 million in advisory and legal fees in the quarter. The rest of the increase came from the operating impact of the mPortal acquisition as well as other head count additions.
For Q3, our estimate is that operating expenses will be up about $1.5 million from Q2. As we noted last quarter, we intend to continue to be aggressive in our investments to support our go-to-market efforts, our product development, and our transformational network projects.
I'd also note a modest change in our non-GAAP tax rate. Based on the current projected mix of our businesses in the U.S. and internationally, we now believe that a 4% non-GAAP tax rate for the remainder of 2015 is appropriate. For Q3 and Q4, you should model 4%. I would expect that that to continue through at least 2017, after which, we believe that our non-GAAP tax rate would transition to approximately 20% of our non-GAAP pre-tax income.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $207 million at the end of the second quarter. We generated $9.6 million in cash flow from operations, accounts receivable of $90 million were up from $73 million in Q1, due in part to the billing strength of the quarter, which also drove deferred revenue to $108 million, up from $101 million in Q1.
Now, on to guidance, as you saw in our earnings press release, we expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $66 million to $70 million, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.27 to $0.37. For the year we've updated our annual guidance to reflect the impact of the mPortal acquisition, as well as the modestly higher tax rate. We now expect 2015 revenue in the range of $264 million to $272 million. Full year EPS is now in the range of $1.36 to $1.61.
As part of our third quarter guide, we expect that we will continue to recognize revenue from several of these large transformational projects, which will cause professional services to be an even more significant revenue contributor in the second-half. We estimate that professional services revenue will be north of $10 million in each of Q3 and Q4.
I would like to reiterate how pleased we are with our business and our performance for the first half of the year. We see momentum and demand for our hosted UC offerings and believe that the steps that we're taking and investments we're making in our business will enable us to continue that momentum into future quarters.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, would you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. You may begin.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you, gentlemen. Nice quarter. Okay. A couple of questions. First of all, can you update us on the seven transformation projects? How many of those are rather you're recognizing revenue from? And maybe by the end of the year, how many of those will be revenue? Give us a sense of that, please.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, I would tell you that several are in both buckets. So, there was revenue off of the balance sheet for those â several of those projects in Q2. I expect the same thing for Q3 and Q4, but there are a couple that won't be revenue until 2016.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. But, by second half, I think you said in the past, all seven should be in revenue. Is that still kind of the expectations?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Well, actually I think with the one that Mike talked about this quarter, it's A. And the â and as I said, a couple won't be revenue until next year.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit about the â maybe, Mike, about the international cable win. Is that â do you consider that a consumer win, number one? Number two, on the consumer VoLTE billing front, is that the print, because I think that's the consumer VoLTE customer you had booked in a while ago. I'm just curious if that's now you're seeing kind of revenue of billings coming from â can you give us an update on those two specific opportunities?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Let me â I'll cover the first part of the question and Jim can cover the second part. So I think the way to look at the win that I talked about during my remarks is â and I think this is how we see lots of these transformation things happening, Dmitry, is that we really are leading in with our flagship UC offer like we did here and as we start getting into the dialog with the account, we started to look at a number of possible transformation items that would map well.
So I think what you're going to see is I wouldn't â it is certainly â we will transform 2 million fixed residential, but we really didn't get into the accounts starting there. We really got the accounts started on the UC front. And then as the customer realize the opportunity to use our platform for both fixed, consumer, mobile then these kind of opportunities arise through the relationship with the account. So that's kind of how I think a lot of these transformation deals will roll out for us. Jim, maybe you can cover the revenue piece for Dmitry.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, Dmitry, I think your question was Sprint consumer of VoLTE source of the consumer VoLTE revenue and we're â we can't be that specific. I mean, clearly that we did announce the Sprint win in VoLTE, but we can't be that specific.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. I thought I'll try. Okay. Let me just ask one last one, and I'll get back in the queue. On the BroadCloud, could you remind me again what that number was? I missed that.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. $8.5 million in the quarter.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, how many â or the better way to look at it, I know Verizon was a customer there. Are there any other Tier 1s that are buying BroadCloud offerings?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. The two Tier 1s that are publicly identified are British Telecom and Verizon, and then a major Tier 2 in the U.S., XO is also publicly identified.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks for that. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. You may begin.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Mike and Jim, what gives you the confidence that the BroadCloud P revenue will accelerate exiting this year after a couple of soft quarters? Is there anything specific? Any new customers coming on-line or specific initiatives they've talked about that you think would lead to that re-acceleration?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, Rich. I think, one of the things we are engaged in a fairly large project with one of our existing accounts in a kind of a new launch, and it gives us pretty good sense that that will help us re-accelerate the growth. And frankly, the efforts we've put into this launch that will take place kind of early fall that has kind of taken quite a bit of resource and time to get off the ground, but we think it's a pretty big opportunity. And so, while we've seen a couple of quarters of soft growth we want to â we think with this launch will do in fall timeframe, we'll see a pretty big uptick in the numbers. And as Jim mentioned in his remarks that we would exit the year at a pretty good clip (23:52) rate on BroadCloud.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. That's helpful color. Thanks. And I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that SIP Trunking actually had a good quarter. I'm wondering if you could add a little color to that. Was that domestic, was it domestic and international, anything? Any color there would be appreciated.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. It was mostly driven by domestic but there was some international uptick. So we're seeing a little bit more international â sort of international momentum in SIP Trunking but it was, it really was mostly driven by our major domestic customers and it's interesting because as we said in the past, the sell-throughs continue to look pretty good, and so it was nice to see the, sort of, software billings start to pick up again too.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. And I think you've only before said that you expected that business to grow this year but not how much. Any other color you'd be willing to give on the trajectory of that business this year?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
I mean, I think it'll lag the overall growth in the business and certainly lag hosted. So, I mean, I still think it'll be growth, but I don't think it'll be substantive relative to the hosted business.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. That's helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. You may begin.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of bigger picture ones. But first a housekeeping item for Jim. The stock comp was up quite a bit in the quarter. Was there something one-time in nature about that or maybe give us some sense of the ongoing stock comp expense that you expect?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So, we had a large grant in April to the company. It was the first large grant we done in a couple of years. It was not to the NEOs, but the rest of the company. We view that as really important in keeping an equity entrepreneurial culture in the company. And like I said, we hadn't done a grant for a couple of years. So it was that grant.
And then, secondly, the way we account for restricted stock units tends to make the first year much higher in expense. So, you actually start seeing it trail down going into next year, but it was all driven by this April grant.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And so, looking at the back half of the year, is it going to be more consistent with the March quarter in terms of a recognized expense or the June quarter?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It starts going down. It'd actually be down in Q3 and Q4, and then further down when we go into the new year.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And then a couple of bigger picture questions. This is obviously a big investment year for you guys with the transformation projects and other initiatives. Talk us through kind of the long-term operating margin projections. And I assume it's leveraged off of higher revenues that gets you there. What is the driver to that?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah. That's exactly correct. We think there's a ton of leverage in the business on growth where we've been funding expansion in professional services and in SaaS. And I think as you get through 2016 and start looking into 2017, we start working our way back to the long-term operating margin. And I think with SaaS as an example, PS, I don't think you're ever going to get above the â for more than a quarter above mid to high 30%s in margin. But SaaS, which were generally in the 40% â 45% range were a little lower this quarter.
That's so scale-driven that when we get that business up into the 70%s from a gross margin standpoint, that'll really help drive the model. And operating expenses and I think, once we get to scale there, the operating expenses are really shared across cloud and software. So, it's by and large the same R&D effort. It's the same selling effort. It's the same marketing effort. It's the same G&A. So, again, I think that'll help drive leverage in the model.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty & Company. You may begin.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Oh, yeah. Good afternoon or good morning, I always screw that up. Quick question. During the quarter you noticed â I noticed that you had a press release out for one customer that converted from BroadWorks to BroadCloud. And on general, are you working to get more of your customers off BroadWorks onto BroadCloud? Can you discuss that overall strategy a bit? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure, Catharine. I'm running around the world you are to be afternoon, so...
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
I know. Sorry.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's okay. Yeah. I think the best way to describe the strategy between BroadWorks and BroadCloud is we've been very open with the customers on selecting whatever option happens to be the right one for the customer. And really looking â helping the customer, kind of, evaluate the economics of those decisions. So I would say that there's a few kind of trends. There's some customers that look at BroadCloud as a fast way to get into market and potentially they will in-source with BroadWorks.
We have some customers that either have not reached large enough scale or for lack of, if you like, technical competency or overall cost of implementation, have looked at moving from BroadWorks to BroadCloud. And then we have customers who are just looking at BroadCloud as their go-to-market platform.
So, I think you're going to see a variety of these strategies. We're trying very much not to push people from one to the other, but really we think it's a huge competitive advantage for us to be able to offer this choice to our customers. And not only choice, if you like, kind of a blanket choice, but we also have some customers are saying, you know, maybe for a small business offer, I'll productize that in my network, but for a medium and large I might use BroadCloud, because I'm not sure exactly how big the opportunity is or I'm not really sure I know how to build the end-to-end process or such. So I think the choice is really the opportunity and you shouldn't read into one press release that this was kind of a â we're trying to push everybody from software to cloud.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And the other question is on â RingCentral has been pretty vocal on the fact that they've been doing very well at AT&T, over 10% of the revenue, TELUS and BT. How many BroadCloud customers do you have and then, what is pretty much your competitive response to RingCentral really trying to move upstream within AT&T or some of these others? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right. I think, unfortunately, I can't speak specifically about our customers. We're not able to do that. I think, generally, I think that your previous question is exactly the question that â and the reason why most of the carriers that we're talking to like the choice of being able to either use our white labeled BroadCloud capability or potentially â or have the potential to in-source into their network. And I think that really is a key differentiator for us.
In addition, I think if you look at the ability for some of the OTT players to go up-market, that's kind of a big stretch. We've been doing it for a long time and we also have extremely, kind of large geographic experience being able to kind of run in 80-plus countries, understanding the regulatory and unique requirements of those markets. So, I think we have a very strong position against the OTT guys. I think you see a little bit of success they're having today. I think we'll end up being a much more strategic supplier to many of those carriers over the long run.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. You may begin.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks, guys. I've got a handful if I may, some quick ones. If you could discuss the pricing environment? What was your head count? What's going on with DSOs? It looks like there's been a big upward trend, I assume some of that â well, I'll let you address it. And if you could address, new â how much revenue is coming from new projects versus existing customers?
And finally, going back to Catharine's question, Mike, so that we don't put you in a position where you're tied by individual customers, perhaps, you could address the broader question of putting aside any one customer, AT&T or otherwise, what are you seeing from the RingCentrals and 8x8s and others in terms of any change in competitive landscape? And I'll stop with that. Thanks, guys.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, I will â let me knock off a few of yours, Paul. And the, pricing, I'd say it's a â we're keeping â it's pretty similar to where it's been in the past. I mean, where no real loss in price realization. If you look at ASPs, arguably with the addition of unified communications in the bundles, we're actually seeing an ability to raise prices. So, pricing is continued to be I think pretty competitive for us, so in a good sense.
Head count, we ended the quarter at 1,150. That included a little over 100 from the mPortal acquisition.
On DSOs, it did pop up a little bit, but we have essentially no bad debt. The â our customers pay. And it's actually more driven by two things: one, billings yet again being in excess of revenue. So, you really kind of have to adjust for billings, not revenue to do real DSOs. And some of that billing happening quite late in the quarter. So it tended to have AR be up.
And I'll let Mike jump in on the broader â I'm sorry, on new projects, I mean, a lot of the transformation projects are not necessarily with new customers. So, it's a little hard to tease out. Obviously, you can look in the professional services line, and we were run-rating $4 million or $5 million a quarter. Now we're run-rating $7 million, suggesting we'll go to $10 million, a lot of that is new projects, but many of those new projects are with existing customers.
So â and then, Mike, do you want to take Paul's, I think, last question?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think â Paul, I think that your question at a high level is, are we seeing any differences in the competitive situation. I think the answer is no. I think the competition has been pretty similar over the last year, year-and-a-half. Clearly, we see the OTT players competing with our service providers as kind of a one level of competition. As I think I mentioned in my remarks, we have a number of our service providers who are doing extremely well against those OTT players. Unfortunately, they don't always break out those numbers, but you could see that the numbers of our top five well eclipse all the OTT players in combination.
So, I think that we're clearly going to see some, like, end-user competition between OTT players and our carrier community, our carrier partners in many markets. A lot about it is obviously focused here in the U.S. and maybe one or two markets internationally. And so, I think the competitive environment hasn't changed very dramatically.
And the OTT players had a few success stories with a few of the service providers. We see that as pretty isolated at this point. And in a number of those service providers, we are in fact busy working and building strategic platforms where we believe we will be there for the long-term. So, that's the environment with those players.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Mike, can you see any change vis-Ã -vis Cisco, Nokia, Ericsson, Alcatel Lucent, Huawei?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say that the big equipment guys are very light in this area. I think they've realized the complexity. We don't see the big switch manufacturers as players in unified communications. I think the stakes have gotten way too complex, way too advanced. Cisco clearly has had a service provider strategy, not been tremendously successful in sell-through. They've obviously convinced a number of service providers to implement their technology for a large enterprise, few thousand seats and above. But those implementations have not gone very well and the overall sell-through of those platforms has not been very strong. So â and we've not seen much change from Cisco on that front.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group. You may begin.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Thank you. My question is back to the professional services business. Jim, could you talk about the kind of the margin trend last quarter, the impact? It sounded like some of it is from the resale in early stage, but it seems like there might be some impact this quarter. If you could, talk about that margin trend.
And how should we think about the lead and lag of the professional services for network transformation project? Is that the leading indicator? When does that typically turn into licenses? What kind of lead and lag should we expect to see from that?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So that â yeah, I think, we'll â the professional service will get up to at least the high 30%s for Q3 and Q4 as some more revenue comes in off the balance sheet. So the compression as it were in this quarter was really, again, billings being higher than revenue and just building that business up as well as the mPortal business. We'll get the full quarter of mPortal for revenue and expense and then, as I said, some of these projects coming in. So, I think we'll exit the year in that mid-30%s to high-30%s range for PS, which is really where we aim it.
In terms of lead and lag, it's a bit of a mixed bag as you see in the filings, billings was, again, higher than revenue, but there was a lot of in and out. So, we are recognizing revenue on several of the projects, and then on several, we're deferring. So it's a little hard to be predictive what we've said and I think continue to believe is for these large transformational projects, we'll see more in professional services this year and then you'll start seeing much more software kick in next year.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood. And in the context of the comment you made earlier about the operating margin ramp more in 2017. How do you see next year in terms of where we are in terms of the investments versus some of the network transformation projects and SaaS revenues turning up higher margins. And if I look at this year versus moving towards your longer term model.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So I think next year, obviously, we're not guiding the year yet. But I think next year could lay out reasonably positively from a margin growth trajectory. We'll have more scale on SaaS, which is really helpful. As we said from these transformational projects, I think you'll see a higher mix of software versus professional services because of those projects. So I certainly would like to see next year where we move up some margin points in gross margin and we get back to 20% plus on non-GAAP operating.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
And final question from a network transformation. If I think about this year, you're guiding low-20% or low to mid 20% growth for revenue. Is there a way to think about base market growth and what network transformation projects are layering on for this year? Is it even possible to think about it that way and how that sort of that trend line continues versus the underlying market growth?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, and Mike, jump in here, I think it's really hard to tease those two out because they're all part of the underlying growth in hosted. We look at sell-through, certainly the sell-through data is positive on our â for our existing customers in production. We've always had a balance of customers in market and others that are implementation about to go into markets. And these transformation projects are by and large hosted projects, although a couple are not. And final piece is as we said there have been mostly professional services and I think that our software line, billings and revenue continues to grow quite nicely which is less impacted by the transformation projects right now.
Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Understood. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. Any uptick in cable orders for the back half of the year? And second, on the $600,000 of hardware sales, do you see that more as a one-off or do you see those kinds of request flowing through going forward? Thanks.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, yes, so cable has been really â especially U.S. cable, great spot for us. And we had a very good first-half and we expect to see a really very good second-half in cable. So, I'd say trend lines in cable dominated by US Cable, very, very strong.
And then, I hope it's a one-off, Brian. It's a â I expect to have something similar in Q3, same customer, same project. And I'm hoping that it'll stay as a very unusual thing for us.
Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. Good luck, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. A couple of quick ones. First, was the 10% customer the same voice over Wi-Fi customer as last quarter or was it a new one?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Different customer.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then it looks like software billings growth lagged overall billings growth by quite a bit. Can you help us understand the delta there?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Jess, it was the â I alluded to it in the prepared remarks. There was a â we had a very large transformation software deal in Q2 of last year. We said it was international and would be revenue â we expect it to be revenue in 2016. And so, that one deal was large enough that it was going to make the comp hard. So, overall, it's very happy to see that level of billings growth, but it definitely made the software comp hard.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last one for me on the outlook. Can you tell us how much of the $4 million lift to revenue is due to mPortal? And perhaps how come we're not seeing more of a life given it seems like the organic business was fairly strong in Q2? It sounds like the commentary on Q3 is better than a lot of people thought, and the original outlook didn't include mPortal. So, just trying to understand the dynamic there.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, the $4 million raise for the year is really all driven by mPortal. And I mean, I think we feel really good about the business. We feel like we're tracking for the year. First-half obviously was strong. For now, just given really how far away we are from Q4, we thought it prudent other than mPortal the fact that we keep the guidance that we had set.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, nothing slipped out, so to say, just the desire to be conservative given where we are in the year?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It seemed prudent â no, nothing negative about the business whatsoever drove the maintain on the guide, the maintain plus mPortal.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right, guys. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. You may begin.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Yeah. I appreciate you coming back to me. Jim, can I just ask you, I know it's been asked a couple other times and I really was paying attention. But that said, can you revisit gross margins, exactly what's going on?
And one other question, if I may, with respect to this very large deal you had in the quarter from the cable operator, can you give us a sense for how large that is?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, okay. So, first on gross margin, really, what's going on is mix, software and maintenance and support are actually, margins are increasing. And so, we had â but what pulled it down a little bit was higher proportion of revenue in PS and in SaaS.
On PS, we continued to add resource and you'll again see â look at PS, a year ago, we earned $4 million to $5 million a quarter. We just did $7 million. We're suggesting it will be north of $10 million in Q3. So that's a pretty sizeable ramp and we've had to hire in front of that ramp. So that tends to pull down margins.
And then, we did with mPortal have expense in the quarter. That also tended to push the PS margin down. I think it will be back up into the high 30%s next quarter.
And SaaS, a little bit of the same, really, it was a combination of the revenue coming in a little lighter than we thought. And really, the expenditures for some of our geo-expansion, and Mike talked about a very large U.S. project that actually involved more investment. But, I think the ROI will be very strong. We'll see that as we exit the year.
The cable deal that Mike referenced in the transformation was definitely a nice deal. I didn't â it was one of our smaller transformation projects, but we thought it would add a different flavor to it, and we're trying to give you guys a bit of how different some of these transformation projects can be.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
All right. And since I trust there weren't other people lined up, so I'm going to ask one more, if I may. On the transformation awards, when you look at the pipeline of available opportunities that haven't yet been awarded, has there been any change? And what does that look like in terms of number of opportunities that are up for grabs, again, putting aside exactly who gets them?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would say that we're really early on in the transformation, Paul. I mean, every incumbent operator needs to shut down their PSTN network. Many carriers have generation one, let me call it, VoIP platforms that are out of maintenance. So there's a lot of opportunity in a lot of them (52:52).
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Mike, I apologize, but let me focus the question. I recognize the long-term trend, but in terms of carriers that have actually put out RFPs or other specific inquiries, whether in an RFP context or otherwise, how many of those are there?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I couldn't tell you the number of active RFPs, Paul. I don't know.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
It's so large that you don't know the number or you're just not familiar with the number?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I just â I don't know. I mean, a lot of these things are not â I mean, I would say some of them are going RFPs. Some of them are just as I described with the one that we were â I described it in my remarks, you kind of back into some of these transformation activities as a result of the work we're doing under unified communications. So, sometimes, they're not really kind of formal full tenders. So, yeah, I don't know how to put an easy number on it for you, Paul. There's X number of RFPs and we're competing for those. I don't think that's a really good reflection of the opportunity or the activity that we're engaged in...
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
When you and Jim talked about it â I'm sorry, when you and Jim talked about newer transformation deals as part of the revenue and part of your billings, you all call it out and I assume for good reason. Similarly, in terms of opportunities as we look further into the future, can't you also â I'm not sure I understand the distinction why you could call it out on the one hand with respect...
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
But, Paul, I'm engaged with 600 carriers in 80 countries. I know what's going on, and a lot â I mean, we're engaged in all those carriers, I mean, and that's a function of how we create our pipeline and our guidance. So, to call out a number on transformations is not the way we do things. I mean, it's part of our overall buildup. And we identify which projects are likely to be engaged â for us to be engaged and over the next period, and that's how we do the buildup, but it's not â I don't think we have a transformation column, which is different than the rest of our business.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And also, Paul, just, so the â I think that in some ways, the U.S. was a little, is a little quicker to market on this, and I think we're cracking very well on the U.S. And then we've noted some in Europe and what makes, to us, Europe even more interesting is you win a major carrier's home country, you're the certainly, the more likely platform as they start transforming their other large OpCo.
So, the trajectory for us on transformation is really pretty positive. And as Mike said, a lot of it is not necessarily are P driven given we're either already in carrier and/or we're already doing the transformation in OpCo 1 and then we become the model for OpCos 2, 3, 4 and 5.

Thank you. Our next question is from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. You may begin.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up; did mPortal have any impact on the earnings outlook for the year?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean it's pretty consistent with the press release on mPortal. We said that it was â we added the $4 million in revenue to the revenue guide and we took â it really impacts $0.02 to $0.03, but we took a couple of pennies off of the EPS guide for mPortal.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
