Good morning and welcome to the First Connecticut Bancorp, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Daukas. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Daukas
Thank you, Austin, and good morning everyone. I am the Investor Relations Officer for the company. And before we begin with our presentation, we would like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcement. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor afforded by that advisement. Thank you.
And now here is John Patrick, our Chairman, President and CEO.
John Patrick
Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. I know historically before other than the analyst that we have that will ask questions and cover us, we typically have a significant number of shareholders on the call and I just want to extend my wishes for happy New Year to all of you and thank you for your interest in our company and your support over the last several years and I look forward to sharing the great 2018 with everybody.
As you can see from our release 2017 was a good year for us. It was very consistent with what we've talked about relative to our core earnings. Our growth drivers have been deposits and loans which continues to build franchise value in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.
As we continue to grow our loan portfolio, asset quality continue to remain very strong. Our deposit growth, our core deposit growth was strong in our footprint especially in light of the fact that we didn't open up any branches during 2017.
The metrics that we've been talking about, I think that youâre seeing it really coming to fruition. Iâm pleased but weâre not done yet with where we are relative to ROA, ROE and especially from an efficiency ratio but more importantly I think from an expense ratio coming in at 2.05, I think is really indicative of our company where we don't have a lot of fee income, and we're a spread-base company driving our core competencies of taking in deposits and making good loans.
I went over the core number, Iâm going to turn it over to Greg in a minute because I can handle key accounts, Greg's got to handle the more of a sophisticated accounting and heâll go into a little bit of the ramifications relative to the tax impact in our deferred tax asset and some of that for everyone.
So Greg, let me turn over to you.
Greg White
Thank you, John.
Couple of things in the press release worth repeating. The deferred tax asset impairment or revaluation was about - was $5 million for the quarter that equates to $0.31 in earnings per share. We also expect the lower corporate tax rate to have a positive impact on our earnings per share this year of about $0.24 to $0.05.
Other than that, as you look at the quarter, if you look at the pretax income quarter-over-quarter its basically flat and that's despite selling about 30 million of residential fixed rate loans out of the portfolio right at the end of the third quarter which obviously had a little bit of drag on the fourth quarter net interest income.
Point-to-point loan growth was $49 million for the quarter. I think it's worth mentioning that if we back out loans held for sale for both quarters, our average loan balance was only up 12 million during the fourth quarter. So obviously that suggests that most of our loan growth came toward the end of the fourth quarter which obviously bodes well for this quarter - the first quarter of 2018.
For an effective tax rate for next year, weâre estimating it right at 19%, and as far as margin the lower corporate tax rate will probably or should affect our fully tax equivalent net interest margin, it will go down by about 4 to 5 basis points.
So I will turn it back to you John.
John Patrick
Great. At this point in time, I just want to mention before we get into Q&A and I know everybody has got a busy day today with lot of earnings announcements that. 2018 our strategy will remain solid or remains the same, will continue to grow deposits and make good loans. We're focused on reducing incrementally our loan to deposit ratio. We still believe we have a very, very good relationship with our regulators. We don't look at it as somewhat of a terrible constraint but we understand that we need to continue to bring that down, so we'll continue to grow deposits quicker than we grow loans.
Then we have some challenges going on within the organization to make sure that we do that and everyone is focused on that. I think 2018 also we know we talked about in the past will have our Manchester office opened in March and I anticipate that weâre going to have great success there. We have companies waiting for us to open that branch. Iâve talked to a couple of business owners over the last couple of days and so we know that day one we will be active and weâll be taking in - we'll be taking in deposits there.
And additionally as we look at our de novo branching strategy, which has been really, really successful over the last seven years now, where we have added more than a dozen branch offices that exceed $50 million in deposits on average in all those offices. We're looking at a couple of the locations, probably one of the location in '18 that will continue to round out and grow our franchise.
It's not just about putting branches and to say we have more, it's doing it smartly with the footprint that we utilize using minimal amount of FTE in those and being really operational efficient.
I talked a lot about operational efficiency over the last several quarters. I think that you can see that coming through loud and clear in our efficiency ratio which is down significantly from last several years and improving at 65%. We are still working on that. We believe we will take improved processes in many of our areas.
Our mortgage banking area is really a shining star where we're taking a lot of redundancy and efficiency - putting a lot of efficiency in that organization, they have done a great job, they have done themselves. And it's really allowed us to go to the market much quicker than what we see our competitors going to market with.
The retail banking side did a great job with deposit growth last year as did the commercial banking side. So all-in-all we've had really six consecutive years now of earnings per share growth. We want to continue on that trajectory. We continue to reward our shareholders with increases in dividends and we had a 67% increase during 2017 or $0.06 a share and hopefully we will continue to have that same trajectory with dividend growth in the future.
So with that, let me turn it over for any questions and answers that anyone has.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Damon DelMonte with KBW. Please go ahead.
Damon DelMonte
So for my first question just kind of looking at loan growth for the upcoming year. You finished off pretty solidly in the last quarter was about 7% linked quarter annualized growth. Based on your pipeline and based on what you see with the economy throughout Connecticut, what you feel comfortable with for 2018?
John Patrick
I think weâre going to go $200 million Damon. Weâre going to look at that and hope to do more obviously the constraints on the deposit side a little bit. We are focused on bringing that down so if we can grow our deposits quicker, weâll grow our loans quicker.
As it relates to the state of Connecticut quite frankly there has been a lot of discussion on it. I'm really optimistic. I'm kind of excited for this year. I've been out recently with Mike and weâve been visiting many of our customers. I was actually - we were actually at three different customers all on the manufacturing sector, very highly selective manufacturing.
Every single one of them needs to hire a minimum of 10 people, those are highly skilled jobs, engineering jobs that type of thing. In our own marketplace, with United Technologies, well, Stanley Works have made significant investments in the area. And in Southern Connecticut, the Electric Boat is going real strong. Both those companies have ten-year backlogs, the Hartford Insurance Group continues to grow and do something.
So, I'm really excited about where we are in Connecticut right now. Yes we have some structural problems within the state itself. Those arenât going to be easy fixes but what we're seeing from some of our businesses is really encouraging.
Now, hopefully that will turn into some growth capacity from them. The challenge is theyâre using their technology and theyâre being very, very efficient in what they are doing and so forth. So there's a balance between their growth and their need to borrow money. So, if theyâre not borrowing money hopefully we have a cash management relationship within this strong enough that weâre going to see a growth in deposits there.
Damon DelMonte
And then with regards to the loan to deposit ratio, obviously your comments were that youâll continue to focus on - Iâm trying to lower that by growing deposits at a faster clip. Do you have a target level for - to get down for 2018, I think youâre at a 113 as of year-end is a goal that you have for 2018?
John Patrick
No, I don't - Greg and I and others here weâre very comfortable operating where we are. We know we have a tremendous amount of liquidity within our mortgage portfolio. We could do some balance sheet engineering and fixed it tomorrow, but there is a cost to that.
So if you believe that you know, I'm not going to get a significant - if I made a 100% loan to deposit ratio or less than that, do you think I'm going to get a significant lift in my stock price. I don't think so I think they look at the quality of the franchise, I think they look at quality of our earnings, I think they look at the quality of the assets and I think they look at our earnings overall.
And then if I'm not being pressured from a regulatory perspective and we have good relationship with the regulators because we do what we say we're going to do. We take them down the strategic road that that we go down than why have the expense right now. And so we believe itâs something we can manage, we want to bring down we understand what the optics are but weâre very, very comfortable operating in this environment.
Greg White
It's Greg, and let me just add you know there's a little bit of a broad brush with this loan to deposit issue. I think banks with 40% to 45% of their loan book residential like ourselves should be looked at a little differently from a bank. Obviously, that's pretty liquid asset for the most part should be looked at differently from a bank with 15% to 20% resi book.
So I have said this before I would make the argument the way again securities are 6%, 7% of our total assets the way I would look at us is take our deposit, back out broker deposits and put that over total assets, weâll look pretty good compared to the industry.
Damon DelMonte
And then I guess one for you Greg, as it relates to the margin could you just repeat comment on the expected impact of the NIM on the - with the lower tax rate and the FTE adjustment, you said about four to five basis points?
Greg White
Yes 4 to 5 basis points, I said third quarter weâd expect the NIM to come down fourth quarter and it did obviously the tightening in December, I would expect the non-FTE NIM to actually increase a little bit in Q1 given that Fed tightening with that said the FTE fully tax equivalent NIM is going to come down 4 to 5 basis points next year.
Operator
Our next question is from David Bishop with FIG Partners. Please go ahead.
David Bishop
Circling back to the better efficiency obviously you guys have done a nice job there maybe not so much from an efficiency ratio but an expense ratio the overhead ratio I guess full year 211 fourth quarter 203. Do you have any sort of specific targets there, do you expect to see that trend and stay below 2% expenses as a percent of average assets?
John Patrick
Yes, we should get there I think so. We don't give a lot of forward guidance we never have that this, you know things happened. And so - but I think that that's a good measure for us specially second half of next year as we go forward.
First quarter typically raises here and I think our seller increase is going to effect it early second quarter and then there's some things in the first quarter we also have Manchester coming on but year-over-year we should be good.
David Bishop
And from what I heard the preamble it just sounds like the one branch coming onâ¦?
John Patrick
One branch coming on and we might have another Iâm just not sure what the timing of that is going to be. Again I was very optimistic on Manchester that was going to happen last year we ran into some environmental issues on that property. I'm really excited about the location we believe it was the right location and we were willing to wait. And so right now I have something in mind and as long as everything works out the way it is and weâll give a little bit color on that in the second quarter.
David Bishop
Have you concerned - I mean you guys have had pretty darn good success with the deposit generation of these new de novos is it getting more aggressive on that side in terms of new branches?
John Patrick
What is the expense piece to it, so as we continue expand the franchise and the footprint incrementally out, we just want to make sure that a number one, that the community is the right community that we would have an advantage in.
In many of these we have some lending business thatâs kind of the lead ahead of that and so it's something that we look at all the time, but the community has to be right community and there has to be the right number of core deposits within that community itself and especially from some of the larger players or other organizations that may be not focused directly on their core business.
David Bishop
I guess sticking with the deposits seen a little bit of an acceleration in deposit cost this past quarter, anything driving the uptick I guess over your term but the deposit beta fourth quarter over third quarter?
John Patrick
Yes, there was just I think a little bit of lag on municipal a little bit. We in Connecticut they have whatâs called the stiff fund that the municipalities can go to and invest directly with the state. We don't try to match that, we've never had a business weâre going out and bidding on those types of deposits.
I think weâve actually built significantly a more core relationships over the last several - during 2017 with municipal. So I think it's just a lag - so we saw that stiff rate go up, we saw overall competitively the municipal rates go up. And so there was just lag there from a little bit in the third quarter and I think that's leveled off now.
David Bishop
How about pricing on the loan side intra quarter just curious what youâve seen out in the markets, are you seeing pricing adjust to the Fed or whatâs happening in terms of yield curve?
John Patrick
Yes, a little bit of that I think that itâs competitive effect. So weâre focused on quality not necessarily quantity and depending upon the - and you can see that and I think in our weighted average risk ratings and things like that that we talk about. I think that as we look at pricing, we want to make sure that weâre competitive where we need to be competitive.
Obviously this cash management relationships and a variety of other relationships that come with it, we can be obviously more competitive for us and better for us. So itâs kind of all over the board depending upon where the deal is, the type of deal, the quality of the credit and enforcing as the competitor in the in the marketplace. But overall I think the spreads held pretty well.
Mike Schweighoffer
David, it's Mike Schweighoffer. We're definitely getting a lift based on the fed tightening certainly on the swap book and anything LIBOR based and prime based. So we're seeing, I don't want to call it and across the Board but both fixed and LIBOR based or prime based and as John said it's across the board but it is largely dependent on where we are within the credit spectrum of the deal.
David Bishop
And one final one, you touched upon the security book there with the movement or rate. Can you add to that? Do you think that growth was a percent of the balance sheet in 2018 from where it is now?
John Patrick
Yes, we would expect to do that, given where rates are, we would do that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
I just wanted to follow back where Dave left off on deposits. What is the balance of those right now? I am sorry, how much.
John Patrick
437.
Laurie Hunsicker
437. Okay. And that compares to 427 last quarter. Do you have a cost on those?
John Patrick
Just under 90 basis points.
Laurie Hunsicker
And do you have a comparable cost on what that was in the prior quarter?
John Patrick
I may have to get back to you on that. Yes, let me get back to you on that one. I don't have a prior quarter in front of me.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then just remind me, those for the most part are in the now interest-bearing line item, is that where they show up or any of them in the CD line?
John Patrick
No. They are now or they are in regular DDA, but there's no CDs.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then how do we think about that the fluctuation in balances there that typically will stay elevated in first quarter and then fall into second quarter or how should we think about it?
John Patrick
Yes, we'll see elevated, so we probably saw a little bit elevation in the fourth because of the tax change and people prepaying taxes and things like that. We manage that. We have internal concentrations that we monitor and manage based upon how and based upon our overall deposits.
What we'll see in the first quarter is that will pick up. We'll see the outflow in the second quarter, third quarter it will start to recover a little bit and then we see it coming, now we saw a little bit more coming in the fourth quarter this year because of that tax law change. So we'll see some stabilization fourth quarter next year.
The second quarter is a real one Laurie where you're going to see the outflows because they take all that cash and they pay teacher's salaries and get everything off, so they start fresh with because it's July 1 of fiscal year start for them.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then just remind me, how does the rate structure work on that?
John Patrick
It depends. There is a variety of things. So it depends what they're looking for. At sometimes the competitive nature of that, we have banks in the marketplace every day that are in need of liquidity. We don't compete on that basis, So we typically go in on a lot of these with RFPs and take a look at what the overall relationship is how much of it is going to be in 3DDA. How much is going to be swept into other types of instruments the breadth and scope of the relationship and it get priced that way.
Laurie Hunsicker
But I mean if we were to try to benchmark this, we will be looking atâ¦
John Patrick
Pardon me. Say that again.
Laurie Hunsicker
Would we be looking at the three-month treasury less acts or how should we think about that?
John Patrick
I know what I have to do is I'd have you back to because I think we have -- we look more at that stiff one. So they have to take a look at where the three-month treasury as compared to the stiff one and then -- and then probably lie somewhere in between them.
Because Massachusetts is a little bit different also because they have the dip up there and we're broadening and deepening some relationships up there too. So that pricing is just a little bit different than Connecticut pricing is.
Greg White
Laurie, this is Greg, I'd add we're about 60 basis points on the overnight borrowings on that book right now. That spread has grown as the short end moves up. So it used to be you if you go back a couple years it was 5 or 10 basis points under fed fund.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then do you rethink your strategy on that at all into a rising rate environment?
Greg White
No. We're just looking to keep it roughly the same percentage of deposits.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then one last question on funding. So if I take out all CDs, you're at 78% core costing 46 basis points up from 40 basis points last quarter 6 basis point delta versus a four basis point increase in the prior quarter. How should we be thinking about that in terms of margin? I appreciate the color that we saw in terms of the tax reform impact on margin obviously that's just the first quarter kind of a reset but in another words as we more broadly look at margin for next year, how should we be thinking about the funding piece playing in?
John Patrick
So let's talk about the fed tightening first, basically we're looking at asset yields to go up per 25 basis point tightening to go up about 8 basis point. Internally now we're almost assuming the same thing on cost of funds.
So if that we're to happen, which we think is pretty conservative, if you look at that approaching a 35% beta on all deposits, we would expect our earnings to grow about 400,000 per 25 basis point fed hike. $400,000 to $500,000, which will be $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share.
So that's again assuming the fed tightens rates. I think if rates just stay here, there will be a slow grind up but certainly not to the extent I just -- certainly not to the extent as if there is fed tightening.
Laurie Hunsicker
And just going back over to branches so Manchester and March plus another one are you closing any branches this year or those are just going to be too net.
John Patrick
No. Doing fine.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then how do we think about Genova branching in 2019?
John Patrick
It's January 2018. So I'm not there yet. Probably halfway through the year, I'll be in 2019 but I'm still put down 2017 my brain is still not there yet. So we'll get there Laurie. What we'll do in June we had our strategic planning session with the Board. Ken and I will lay out what that strategy will look like.
Ken has already started some analysis on it now and we'll determine what direction that we're going to go. So quite frankly if you think about east and west, diminishing return, if we think about North and South, then we're going, if you look at Hartford as the apex, north and south of them in one quarter, obviously more populations.
So we're going to go where the population is where some of the larger players are and there is more density of deposits. So it would be a north-south strategy east west is kind of not much left out that way.
Laurie Hunsicker
And do you have an update on your last three branch openings where you are collectively in deposits i.e. the Vernon, the East Longmeadow and the West Springfield?
John Patrick
Yes, Vernon is roughly $62 million in Vernon, $53 million Longmeadow $63 is West Springfield.
Laurie Hunsicker
I am sorry, what was West Springfield?
John Patrick
$63 million.
Laurie Hunsicker
$63 million. And then do put any of the municipal deposits included in those branches?
John Patrick
Only those municipal deposits is generated from those will be counted and we do not have a lot. I think we have under $2 million of offering, but generally non-municipal.
Laurie Hunsicker
And last question the eight de-novo you have opened you gave us the branch average of $53 million I think that was two quarters ago, do you have an update, is it roughly the same or do you have a refresh?
John Patrick
I think it's roughly the same, it's up a little bit more. I think it's $61 million is the '13 is the average.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Matthew Breese
John I just want to follow-up on the growth outlook sounds like youâre pretty optimistic. Just wanted to get a sense of the breakdown there, it sound like its more on the C&I the business side just wanted to hear your thoughts on the resi and commercial real estate side and whether or not weâll see equal parts growth from all three of those items?
John Patrick
Yes I think we will, I think thatâs what we try to do. We love to continue to grow C&I a little bit more, I always like C&I lending. I think that itâs a deeper, deeper relationship from that perspective. That said, thatâs more a challenging to move a customer than it is sometimes on the real estate side where there's an opportunity there to fund something that either is purchase or refinance or a new project.
So Iâd like to see more on the C&I side, but weâre looking at from a balanced perspective. I'll tell you on the mortgage banking side - I'm really, really pleased with our operation and kind of where we are in the efficiency within it.
We've considerably reduced our application to clear to close time to be probably one of the most competitive if not the most competitive in the marketplace, and we think we can get some - we can reduce that a little bit further.
I think that most youâre going to see first quarter typically we will emphasize a little bit more on the mortgage banking side, so we get full year advantage of those earnings and so our servicing portfolio continues to grow very nicely also there.
So, I'm pleased with where we are. We have the resources to be able to continue to grow that. As I have talked about before, we built a organization that has a good solid foundation and thatâs scalable. And we look at that in all three business lines.
Matthew Breese
And then just kind of going to your reserves, obviously a little bit more of robust growth outlook, your reserve clearly covers NPAs by a growing percentage each quarter. So I just wanted to get a sense, could we see the growth come in better than last year but the provision maybe lagged a little bit?
John Patrick
Maybe a little bit, I'm not - Greg you want to comment on that.
Greg White
John mentioned the 200 million of loan growth the way we expect to grow loans, the majority being commercial. It would probably require about an 80 basis point reserve thereabouts so call that 1.6 million. If you look at our charge-offs over the past two to three quarters they have been negligible so it's the 1.6 million plus charge-offs - weâll end up being pretty close to the number.
John Patrick
I tell everybody you know our problem with our reserves is we don't have enough charge-offs, they say let me start lending again and weâll get some but they won't let me lend so where we are.
Matthew Breese
My last one, Greg I'm not sure if you mentioned this with each successive rate hike at this point, what is the sensitivity to the NIM?
Greg White
Weâre being pretty conservative on that estimate now. In the two basis point plus or minus, but again that's assuming like a beta of 30% to 35% on the cost of funds which we haven't experienced but that's in that answer.
Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Patrick for any closing remarks.
John Patrick
Thank you, Austin. I appreciate everybody's time and effort that they put in to take a look at our company and invest in our company for those investors and shareholders that are out there. Weâre really focused on our continued organic growth and growing deposits and loans so that our story isnât switching quarter-to-quarter it remains consistent.
We think there is great opportunity for us. Weâre really optimistic about the future and we look forward to driving shareholder value. So, thank you again for your interest and have a good day.
