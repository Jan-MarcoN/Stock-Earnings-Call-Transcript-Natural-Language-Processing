Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the IHS Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over Eric Boyer, Vice President Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.
Eric Boyer
Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS third quarter earnings conference call. We issued our third quarter earnings release earlier this morning. If you do not have a copy of the release it is available on our website at IHS.com.
Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items.
Our earnings release includes both our GAAP-based income and statement of cash flows and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules are included in our release and can also be found on our website.
The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statement. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS is prohibited.
Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found in IHS's filings with the SEC and on the IHS website.
After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, IHS Chairman and CEO; and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?
Jerre Stead
Thank you, Eric. Good morning and thank you all for joining us as we share our third quarter results. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today and we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in New York City next week on October 7.
Before we get started, I want to discuss a topic that has been in the news. Our normal practice is to not comment on market rumors or speculation and I've only done so one other time. However, since the recent speculation is causing uncertainty for our shareholders, I feel it appropriate to comment that we are not pursuing the acquisition of Solera.
Let me say that again. I feel it appropriate to comment we are not pursuing the acquisition of Solera. We will not be commenting further on this topic.
My first quarter back at HIS has been a busy and productive one, meeting with colleagues, customers and the investment community. I want to share some thoughts after having had the past several months to assess our operations and our execution.
Certainly there is a tremendous amount that is working well and there are also some things on which we can and are improving. Two main thoughts for me; first, we've made progress over the past several years on initiatives that drive our long-term strategy and which will help us drive financial performance moving forward.
Second, since my return, we've moved very quickly to take steps that are 100% within our control to drive improved operational execution, financial performance and shareholder return. These steps involve organizational alignment, operational efficiencies, pricing, sales operations, capital deployment, including M&A strategy, share buyback and employee stock compensation.
We look forward to providing more details on our strategic and operational initiatives next week at our Investor Day.
For Q3, revenue performance was largely in line with our expectations. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and earnings per share. Few highlights for the period include revenues of $588 million, up 6% from Q3 of 2014 and up 3% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.3% represents an expansion of 90 basis points.
In terms of our core industries and horizontal workflows, resources, which includes our energy and chemical teams, continues to experience declining subscription growth due to industry dynamics.
Despite the current challenge in the energy end market, we continue to be very enthusiastic about our energy assets and we believe our resources growth rate will return to historic levels when industry CapEx and OpEx levels stabilize.
In industrials, which includes our automotive, technology, maritime and trade and aerospace and defense teams, we continue to see the benefits of operational improvement and solid integration of acquired assets over the last several years, reflected in the organic growth of 11% for the quarter and 8% year-to-date.
We're very pleased with our industrial businesses, which has been built over the last eight years through acquisitions and organic product development. This is a great example of the results we create when we execute against our strategy in a stable macro environment.
Our horizontal products, total organic revenue growth of 4% benefitted from the boiler pressure vessel code, but continues to be impacted by weaker non-subscription revenue primarily from our OERM software business.
Now turning to M&A, our strategy is focused on larger scaled assets that are at least $100 million in revenue and at least $500 million in purchase price. In addition, we look for assets that provide clear strategic and financial strategies to our existing business including strong EPS accretion and continued capital structure flexibility.
With that, Iâll turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Thank you, Jerre.
Letâs start by reviewing the financial results for the third quarter. Revenue was $588 million, an increase of 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $190 million, an increase of 9% and margin expansion of 90 basis points and adjusted EPS was a $1.56, an increase of 5%.
Relative to revenue, we continue to see trend similar to those discussed on the Q2 call. Our total revenue growth of 6% included 3% organic revenue growth, acquisitions of 5% and an FX drag of 2%. Subscriptions represented 79% of revenue and grew organically 5%.
Our non-subscription organic revenue declined 4% due primarily to energy headwinds that also benefited from $8 million in revenue from the boiler pressure vessel code.
Looking at regional performance, Americaâs overall revenue growth was 9%. Organic growth was 5%. Acquisitions added 6% and there was 1% drag from FX. Americaâs organic subscription revenue growth was steady at 6% due primarily to strong industrials performance.
EMEAâs overall revenue growth was minus 3%. Organic growth was minus 2%. Acquisitions added 4% and there was a 4% drag from FX. EMEAâs organic subscription revenue growth was 1%. APAC's overall revenue growth was 4%. Organic growth was flat. Acquisitions added 6% and there was a 3% drag from FX.
APAC's organic subscription revenue growth was 6%. Looking at industry performance, we continue to see strength in our industrials product offerings offset by lower resources revenue in our energy product offerings.
Industrials' organic revenue growth was 11%. Organic subscription growth was 11% and non-subs growth was 9%. We expect our industrials organic growth rate to remain in the high single digit range in the coming quarters.
Our horizontals organic revenue growth was 4% with organic subs growth of 2% and non-subs growth of 8% including the $8 million revenue benefit from the boiler pressure vessel code. And our resources organic revenue growth was minus 4% with organic subscription growth of 2%.
Organic non-subs growth was minus 30% and was negatively impacted by lower energy software, consulting and services revenue. On a constant currency basis, our year-to-date resources organic subscription base, which represents the annualized values of subscription contracts has declined approximately $20 million or about 3% on a subscription base of approximately $750 million.
Despite this decline, the overwhelming majority of accounts in our underlying sub base had been flat to slightly up.
As I mentioned earlier, we expect continued pressure on a our resources organic subscription growth rate as lower current sales activity will be reflected in the earned revenue performance of future periods.
Turning now to profits and margins; we continue to deliver solid profit in margin expansion. Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA totaled $190 million, up 9% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.3% and represented 90 basis points of margin expansion. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.5% represents a 100 basis points of margin expansion.
We're very pleased with this performance, which reflects business model efficiency and focused cost management in this lower growth environment. In addition, we continue to balance investment in areas such as our automotive offerings and energy asset valuation offerings to drive future growth and we continue to see opportunities for future operational efficiencies and margin expansion.
Regarding segment profitability, Americaâs adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $145 million. EMEAâs $45 million adjusted EBITDA was also up 9% from the year-ago quarter and APAC's adjusted EBITDA was $16 million versus $13 million from the year-ago quarter.
Turning to adjusted EPS, Q3 increased to $1.56 per diluted share, a $0.07 or 5% improvement over the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was impacted by higher depreciation and interest expense. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 23% and our adjusted tax rate was 28%. Q3 free cash flow was $134 million and represented a conversion rate of 70%.
Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $453 million and represented a conversion rate of 62%. As previously discussed we're expecting free cash flow conversion in the mid 60s for the full year.
Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter-end debt balance was $2.085 billion, which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 times and we closed the quarter with $264 million of cash.
In Q3 we repurchased a total of $38 million of shares, which completed our $100 million buyback authorization and leaves $491 million against their $500 million share repurchase authorized in Q3. We expect to accelerate our $500 million share buyback in the next few quarters.
We're reiterating our guidance, which is on an all-in basis and assumes no further acquisitions, currency movements, pension mark-to-market adjustments or unanticipated events.
For 2015, we expect revenue to trend toward the midpoint of our current range of $2.3 billion to $2.34 billion, including subscription organic growth at the low end of our 5% to 6% organic growth range and negative non-subscription growth. We expect full year all-in organic growth of 1% to 2%.
We also expect adjusted EBITDA to trend toward the high end of our current range of $725 million to $740 million and adjusted EPS to trend toward the high end of our current range of $5.80 to $6.
In summary, we expect our energy subscription business to deliver slightly down sales in an environment where energy spend has been significantly reduced. We also expect continued strong growth in our industrials product offerings, which coupled with the strength of our business model, will allow us to continue to deliver strong margin expansion and solid cash flow in 2015.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jerre.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Todd. Iâm very pleased to be back leading IHS and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us.
We're executing our strategies and building organic growth and expanding margins with a renewed sense of urgency and focus. Our energy business has temporary headwinds; however, we have great confidence in the long-term growth prospects.
Our non-energy businesses continue to perform very well due to operational improvements and the integration of our acquisitions. We will drive continued shareholder value through the combination of organic growth, margin expansion, key acquisitions and capital returns.
Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day next week, October 7 in New York.
Todd and I are now ready to answer your questions. So let's start the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Bill Warmington
Good morning, everyone.
Jerre Stead
Good morning, Bill.
Todd Hyatt
Good morning, Bill.
Bill Warmington
So historically, 60% of renewals have been concentrated in Q4 and Q1. And I just wanted to see if we could get some color on how the renewals have gone for the 40% that's not in that peak period, and then also your early read heading into the subscription renewal peak season.
Jerre Stead
Couple quick comments Bill, thanks. I'll have Todd pick up on the details. As we've continued over the years, it's spread out much closer quarter-by-quarter than it was three-four years ago.
I do want to make one quick comment because last time we went through the energy downturn, which was 2008, 53% of our total revenue was in energy. At the end of this quarter, 34% is in energy.
We laid out a plan. Energy is a wonderful business and it will continue to be for years to come, but we laid out a plan where we said we're going to get better balance in total and we've done that.
So Todd, pick up on the second part of that question please.
Todd Hyatt
Yes, I think as far as the renewals, when we look at industrials, we see very strong performance and 11% sub growth in the quarter. We've been very strong throughout the year. We remain very optimistic with that -- with that part of the business and are very encouraged with what we're seeing and expect very strong continued growth.
When we look at the horizontal area that's been down a notch because of some pressure in OER&M, but we have a product design business that's a big, big part of that part of the company and product design continues to be a very stable performer and we expect that to continue and certainly Q4 is a big renewal season for product design and we're very encouraged with what we're seeing.
And then of course there is the resources part of the business and we've seen through this year some pressure and we talked about the sub base, I talked about that on the call. When we look at that, the vast majority of the accounts in energy are getting renewed and they're getting renewed at flat to up.
And in the past, we've talked about a couple of areas. We've talked about couple of losses from NOCs that fell into the sub base. We have a little bit of impact from software tied to E&P that's in that sub base.
But Bill, I think we have a stable performer there and it's not certainly where we want it to be, but we're working very hard on it and I think as we move into next year, we still see a clear path to have a resources business at a sales level that will be flat to slightly up as we go into next year as we think about next year activity.
Jerre Stead
I think Todd you covered it great. I'd just add one bit of color. If you take out the two parts Todd just talked about is in the software, on a $750 million base, we're down less than 1%, $5 million for the year in subscription based organic numbers on energy and that feel about as good as we're going to get. So we're very pleased with that.
Next question please.
Operator
Our next question is from Oscar Turner with SunTrust. You may begin.
Oscar Turner
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Jerre Stead
You bet.
Oscar Turner
So you guys saw another quarter of impressive industrial strength. And so just was looking for more color on what was the strongest vertical there. And then also, how much of the growth was driven by product development versus the acquisition integration that you mentioned?
Jerre Stead
I'll start and have Todd pick up on that. Automotive continues to be very strong, really good job across the Board, but the rest of the pieces in industrial are performing very well too. In fact I feel really good with the solid performance in total.
Todd, pick up onâ¦
Todd Hyatt
Yes, automotive is the biggest part of that -- of the industrials and automotive continues to perform very well and we have seen new product launches in automotive that have driven growth in that part of the business, but we continue to have maritime business that is performing in a pretty stable, mid single digit fashion.
I had talked about this last call, but A&D was a negative performer. In the last couple years it's in the positive range, A&D very creative with products rolled out a new product on Tableau that I think has been well received by the marketplace.
So I think it's a mix of both. It's a mix of some wins in new product and just better execution, but we remain very encouraged with that part of the business.
The other thing we've done in technology is we've done a good job of consolidating some of the products. So technology we had multiple acquisitions that we used to build that part of the business and we've really consolidated products and I think we've created by doing that more robust pick your offerings to customers and that's made a lot of progress on that in the past year and we expect that to continue into 2016.
Jerre Stead
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Brandon Dobell with William Blair. You may begin.
Brandon Dobell
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Jerre Stead
Good morning.
Brandon Dobell
I wondered if you could talk about may be Jerry some of -- may be some specific examples of organizational alignment and sales operations changes that you've kind of deemed as higher priority tackle in the near term?
Jerre Stead
No, a great question. Thanks, weâll cover this in much more detail next week at Investor Day, but just to give you a perspective something that we actually laid out in my office over seven years ago, as we started to do all of the infrastructure build that I am so proud of and accomplished all the new products that we've been investing in was to move towards a very business focused on a global basis organizations where one person would be accountable for the business having all of the pieces that is needed to be successful including sales, marketing, product management, development, etcetera, all in one organization.
As I said, we'll cover that in great detail next week, but we announced that move internally on September 16, that will take place on December 1 of this year at the beginning of our new fiscal year.
Right now, I want to make sure all of our people focus on the delivering Q4, which we expect to do and wrap up a really good year from the standpoint of seeing the implementation of so many things we set out. Itâs an important step forward and as I said Brandon, weâll talk much more about it next week. Thanks for the question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Gary Bisbee
Hi guys, good morning and thanks for clarifying the Solera thing. A lot of drama sounds like for nothing, but the question here, you've -- despite the slower growth this year, you've done an excellent job continuing to deliver on margin expansion.
And I guess if I think out over the next couple of years, what type of revenue growth do you need to continue to hit this 100 basis points a year that you've talked about as a logical target for that. Do you need reacceleration or is there still room if itâs another year of somewhat sluggish growth that you could deliver on the margin, thank you?
Jerre Stead
Great comment, great question Gary. Iâll start. If you look at our all-in guidance for 2015, which instead of annual its now quarter, of course because you got three actuals, youâll see that we will offset a new high based on our current guidance of our margins somewhere around 33% if you do the math. So thatâs a new high for us going forward based on our current guidance.
And I have a very strong opinion on this one and Iâll have Todd add to it. We want to see the organic growth pick up in the future, but all of the opportunities we have inside of our company to gain efficiencies to be more focused to simplify many of the things we're doing including organization and to execute gives us plenty of room to deliver for the next two to three years, the 100 basis points or better.
And then we'll look forward to seeing the organic growth picking up in the future, Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Just to build on that thought Jerre, we do see opportunity for continued operational efficiency. Brandon asked a question about things like sales ops and organizational alignment and we see opportunity to driving more efficient cost structure and frankly a simpler business operation through those activities.
We also talked a lot about of the infrastructure that we build about our investment in platform's applications and so we have a very scalable model where we can add revenue without adding additional costs.
From a simple math perspective, 5% revenue growth and 3% cost growth is the formula that is at a 100 points. So we certainly want to return to a mid single digit grower and look to accelerate that.
But I think in this lower growth environment, the levers are certainly available and weâll continue to execute very mindfully and as far as balancing investment ensuring we're delivering a level of profit that drive shareholder value.
Jerre Stead
Thanks. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.
Peter Appert
So, good morning Jerre you told us, you're not going to buy, can you give us any color in terms of what you're seeing from an M&A perspective? And I asked this in the context of -- I get the sense that maybe your focus obviously has been on improving internal operations, getting the ship right again here recently, does that imply perhaps less focus on M&A here on a intermediate term basis?
Jerre Stead
No, thanks Peter, actually a great question. We've got a lot going on to execute against the plans we've laid out. But when I was closing and I'll just say this again because we're actually very focused on the kind of M&A that would be -- provide shareowner value that would do it from a standpoint of operating with very accretive EPS that would be very complimentary strategically and would provide the kind of shareowner return that we expect to deliver.
When we look today with the new criteria we set, another side comment is that its allowing us to increase productive because we were chasing a lot of small acquisitions. We've stopped all of that and let people focus on delivering the results for the customers and our shareowners.
So there are businesses that we're looking at that would fit that new criteria again focused on a great strategic fit and a great financial fit that includes allowing us to have plenty of flexibility from a balance sheet.
Some of those have gone back as far as years ago when we had discussion. I always like to say that our job is to be from an acquisition standpoint to be patient, to be persistent, but to be the preferred acquirer when we make it and that sometimes takes a long time.
So we are paying attention. Itâs much easier of course when you're looking at a few versus many as we were before. We are paying attention, but you're right, we're very focused on focus simplicity and execution and we'll continue to be and if and when the right acquisition or acquisitions come that fit those criteria, we'll look forward to acquiring them and integrating them as fast as we can. Thanks Peter.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Andre Benjamin
Thanks, good morning. Within the industrials business I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about auto specifically, how you're progressing in both with developing new products to up-sell and the international expansion you talked about at the time of the acquisition?
And then should we still expect you to grow the auto vertical via M&A as I know you've talked about a bit about the importance of scale versus some of the other verticals you're looking at?
Jerre Stead
Thank you. Todd, pick that one up.
Todd Hyatt
Well we like the automotive industry and weâve been very successful there and so weâll always evaluate opportunities. I think relative to -- I talked about this on the last call, but we have developed some new products and new offerings that allow -- Jonathan talked about this at Investor Day a year ago, the source of sales product that we were building that provided OEMs an ability to do more targeted marketing.
What I would say about automotive is they're probably as far ahead as anyone, any of the business in the company around doing analytics with the underlying information and providing more robust offerings to customers. So weâll talk about that more next week at Investor Day what some of those things look like.
As far as international, we continue to see opportunity internationally, but automotive is very heavily weighted to North America right now, in terms of the composition of the portfolio and we certainly have a robust marketplace in North America and I think we have multiple vectors to growth here and so weâll make the investment in the place that we think we can drive the greatest return.
So more to come next week, but a lot of positives in that part of the business.
Jerre Stead
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may begin.
Manav Patnaik
Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for also clarifying the Solera news and I guess just in the context of capital allocation and M&A divestitures etcetera, so you said you're clearly still focused on some of the larger deals and I was wondering in that context, is that why the buybacks werenât as much as maybe what I would have thought you would have done after the commentary on the last call.
And outside of just M&A, I was wondering if even divestitures are on the cards especially on the non-subscription side since there is I guess a lot of work it seems that you said needs to be done to stabilize that piece of the business.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Manav. I'll start. As I said on the Q2 call, we are looking and continue to look at making sure that our businesses fit our going forward strategy. If and when we make any decisions on that subject, we'll announce them as soon as we do.
But Todd, pick up on theâ¦
Todd Hyatt
I wouldn't read anything into the buyback Manav. I talked about where we were looking at how we accelerate that. It's still a very high priority within the company. I think for us we look at the capital structure, the leverage and the level of buyback as we move through.
But if you look at Q3, we completed the $100 million buyback in Q3 and so that really went into really about the time of the call that went well into June. So there wasnât a lot of time to put in place an active program relative to the $500 million, but that's something that we're putting in place and will be actioning in the coming quarters.
Jerre Stead
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Anjaneya Singh
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to build on the earlier industrials question. Hoping you can talk a little bit more about the non-sub side of things. I appreciate the commentary earlier that some of it's due to new products.
I was just hoping to get a sense of whether these new products can be transitioned to more subscription type engagements longer term and if the growth that you're seeing is primarily coming from up-sales to existing customers or new ones, thanks?
Jerre Stead
Good question. Todd, pick up.
Todd Hyatt
Well, it's a great question. The sub number for the industrials was 11%. So I don't want you to think it's the story only of non-subs. Non-subs' 9%, so non-subs' is very, very strong.
And within that sector from a non-sub perspective, there is a level of transactional work. I think we have had some recall activity that drove a little bit higher non-subs at 9%. So that part of the business on the non-subs has been very robust.
But I don't want you to lose the fact that we continue to perform very well with the sub part of that business as well.
Jerre Stead
Good. Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Toni Kaplan
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Jerre Stead
Good morning. How are you, Toni?
Toni Kaplan
Good, thanks. Just a couple on guidance. So wanted to ask maybe in a different way about industrials, really good quarter and so anything that call out in terms of one-time items or big contracts on the subscription side and just asking because you're guiding to I guess high single next quarter, so just wanted to understand the deceleration.
Todd Hyatt
Well, Toni, we didn't say high single next quarter. We said this is a high single digit grower in future quarters. So there is in the deceleration in this part of the business. I expect the growth rates that we saw at sub to continue to be very, very strong. So not signaling a deceleration at all in industrials.
Jerre Stead
And there was no one-time large event as Toni was asking about. Very straightforward and it's a great business like I said in my script that really shows what we can do when we lay out and implement our strategies and we'll continue to. Thank you, Toni. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO. You may begin.
Henry Chen
Hi, good morning. It's Henry Chen on for Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to -- if you could clarify on your guidance for the organic growth rate, it looks like you winded in from 2% to 1% to 2%, just wanted to clarify what's driving that change, thanks?
Jerre Stead
Yes, Todd?
Todd Hyatt
Well, the big thing is that the resource is down a bit from Q2. If you look at the sub base, it's down little bit and we talk about the fact that the nature of sub base is that gets recognized in earned revenues. But still I think the performance across the vast majority of energy is stable.
Jerre Stead
Well said, Todd. And as I said earlier, we feel very good about and when you think about the world being down 20%-25% more operationally in energy little bit, our energy customers and operational cost in 25% to 30% in capital and when we're delivering almost flat subscription based revenue, I just got to feel very good about it and look forward as we said this thing as that industry stabilizes us moving back to the historic levels we have.
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Paul Ginocchio
Thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned earlier that software and resources was down a little bit. I thought you had launched Vantage. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how that's going, thanks.
Jerre Stead
Yes, happy to, Todd?
Todd Hyatt
Yes, the software is the E&P exploration software. So it's not tied to Vantage. Vantage is -- it will be sold as a data analytic product. We have a handful of customers for Vantage. We've had some successes in the quarter.
We will have the commercial launch toward the end of Q4. We're building marketing and customer acquisition plans tied to that. We feel very good about the product itself. We think we have a very good product, very competitive product with robust functionality.
I think I talked about this on the last call. There is an entrenched incumbent and so given the environment, it will be a build as far as the Vantage rollout and our ability to capture market share, but this is certainly when we'll provide more color at next week.
But we continue to be pleased with the progress around the product and with the plans for the commercial launch.
Jerre Stead
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may begin.
Jeff Meuler
Yes, thank you. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on resources and the preliminary commentary for 2016; if I recall correctly, I think the organic sub space was down like $10 million going into this quarter and now it's down $20 million, I think you're talking about getting back to growth next year.
So where is the -- and obviously it's been remarkably resilient as you pointed out relative to what the market is doing, but what gives you the confidence in getting that back to stabilization to growth and that what looks like a little bit of incremental headwind that we're at the end of that, thank you?
Jerre Stead
No, great question. Todd?
Todd Hyatt
No, it's a good question and I think you've actually laid it out pretty well. We do have a negative sub base for this year and that negative sub base for this year is going to pressure the earned revenue next year. That's the way the subscription model works.
So what I talked about was targeting in 2016 getting the sub base back to a flat level and looking for opportunities to grow that base. I think we follow the market as you know very, very closely. Our commentary is for the next two to three quarters, we think that it will be -- continue to be challenging one for the oil industry.
There are some smaller players in the U.S. upstream that will be under pressure, but we do think most of the big companies have made most of their cost reductions and the IOCs and major independents are in the process, while they're in the process of deciding their capital budgets for 2016 and we expect some modest trimming.
The planning assumptions that we proposed for '16 have been received relatively positively. So there is -- never going to be able to forecast this perfectly and certainly an industry that has challenge will be challenged in the next few quarters, but we see an ability to get those to a flat sales level and look to build on that in 2016.

I would just add two comments to that. Next week at Investor Day, we'll have Nariman Behravesh, our Chief Economist give a pretty good view of what's -- in fact very good view of his expectations of what will happen in 2016 on the global economy and Dan Yergin will give us a great update on what he sees in the energy industry going forward.
So we'll give you as much color on that subject as we can next week and I think Todd describes it very well. I feel good today about where we are and where we're positioned with our energy team.
Thank you. Next question.

Our next question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Gary Bisbee
Yes, just one quick follow-up on that. I think there was last winter as you got through the selling season for energy, the company stated some confidence that the customers that had left or shrunk the size of their purchase would need to come back at some point.
And I guess is it right to say that, that from the commentary you provided today, you don't expect a lot of that in this coming yearend selling season, but remain confident longer term that they're not going to go without the product. Is that right or would you say it differently, thank you?
Todd Hyatt
The product is very sticky. It's a product that's critical for production activities. As far as customers that have cancelled coming back, we always -- there is always some at the lower end of the market there are customers that enter and exit the market.
So we always have an operating assumption around new business, but we're not focusing -- we're not expecting to see huge new business in energy in 2016 if that's the question.
Jerre Stead
And thanks, Gary, I'd just wrap it up by saying what we started out today, we feel very good about our industrial business. It's growing and it's going to continue to grow. We feel very good about the changes we're making across the Board that we'll spend a good deal of time describing next week and we feel very good about where we're positioned.
As I said we'll return and expect to return the historical levels of performance in our energy business and chemical business in the months and years ahead. So I look forward to seeing you all next week.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Eric to wrap up.
