Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MeadWestvaco Second Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Toni. And good morning, everyone.
Before the market opened, we announced that MWV's income from continuing operations in the second quarter was $67 million or $0.37 per share. John Luke, Jim Buzzard and Mark Rajkowski are here to discuss these results in detail.
Before we do that, just to remind you that the notification for this call was broadly disclosed and it is also being webcast at mwv.com where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.
John A. Luke
Jason, thanks very much. And good morning.
In both our initial outlook and subsequent pre-announcement, we set expectations for lower performance in the second quarter largely due to operational issues stemming principally from an extended outage at our Covington mill. In commenting on our performance for the quarter, I'd highlight the following: First, the Covington operational challenges are now behind us. Second, we generated bottom line benefits from our cost-reduction activities and the investments we've made to improve returns, most particularly our expansion in Brazil, at Rigesa. Third, we doubled our cash flow from operating activities compared to the second quarter last year. And fourth, we drove continuing commercial progress in our markets consistent with our profitable growth strategies. With the rest of our presentation today, we'll elaborate on each of these areas. Jim will talk at greater length about the impact of the outage at Covington and other operational issues during the second quarter, which adversely impacted our Food & Beverage segment by about $35 million.
We're off to a good start with our overhead cost reductions. Mark will talk about our progress in more detail. The impact was measurable in the first half and will strengthen in the second half of the year. Further, the big projects that will contribute to better growth and productivity going forward, especially the mill investments in Brazil and the new biomass boiler at Covington, are on-track, and we're beginning to see some of the earnings and cash benefits in Brazil already. These benefits and lower working capital levels led to the significant improvement in cash flow during the quarter.
Despite the adverse impact of the operational challenges, our underlying business performance during the second quarter continued to improve. We had good commercial progress and share gains, notably in markets for food packaging, beverage multi-packs, medical dispensers and our personal care solutions. Overall, we grew our top line by 1% in the second quarter even as the uncertain macroeconomic environment trended lower -- toward lower global growth.
GDP estimates in many countries, especially across Europe and key emerging markets, have been revised downward, and political, social and economic instability exists in many regions. Because of this weakening macroeconomic backdrop, we are even more focused on our strategies for profitable growth, including innovation, commercial excellence, emerging markets and expanded participation. A good example of these strategies coming together is the pump-on-tube dispensing solution we recently launched with a major skin care brand donor in India. This progress represents all of the things we're focusing on across the portfolio, bringing together our R&D capabilities with deep market knowledge and close partnerships with key customers especially in a market like personal care in India, which is growing at an annual rate upwards of 9%. We also made good progress during the quarter on the process we announced in April to explore alternatives for our land management business. The recent activity in that segment, as well as the market conditions in the Charleston region, have only strengthened the value we expect to deliver through this process.
In short, we're generating continued growth in our markets with our strategies. We expect this momentum, along with the continued success in Brazil, to provide leverage in the second half of the year.
I'll now turn it to Jim for commentary about our performance in each segment. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Thank you, John.
Our earnings performance in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the major cold outage and related productivity issues, as well as by the implementation of a new order management system. Our commercial performance was solid throughout the quarter, and our overall results returned to more normal levels once we had resolved the challenges at Covington.
Beyond the issues that drove the $35 million negative impact on our Food & Beverage segment, the rest of our business performed relatively well, with strong volume gains in targeted consumer packaging markets, increased pricing in our Industrial business in Brazil and continued penetration of the highest-value markets for our Specialty Chemicals. We believe the commercial, operating and overall business performance momentum we had at the end of the second quarter is a good indicator for the stronger earnings and cash flow we've been anticipating in the second half of the year.
Now I'll provide some more detail about performance in each of our segments. In the Food & Beverage segment, the negative impact of the Covington cold outage and system implementation pulled earnings well below last year's level. We are confident these issues are behind us, and the mills are now running well and supported by relatively strong demand.
In the broad markets we serve in this segment, some modest easing of food shelf prices and our end user market focus led to higher volumes for us, while soft drinks and beer continued to be challenged especially in Europe and North America. We continue to do well with market-leading food customers and brand owners across frozen food, dry food and bakery categories, as well as club store packaging where our paperboard solutions are replacing some corrugated alternatives.
In beverage, our multi-pack solutions are doing well in spite of a very tough market in which carbonated soft drinks continued to show volume weakness. Our overall carton sales were even with last year's performance. And we saw significant increases with leading brand owners in North America, Asia and Latin America where our sales were up 2%, 7% and 6%, respectively. These carton volume sales, in part, came from the machines we've placed with global customers over the past few years. And our pipeline of machinery orders is very strong for the next 6 months, which will keep the cycle trending in our favor.
In both food and beverage markets, Europe continues to be a weak spot in the market and in our results, with record unemployment levels and poor weather having a significant negative impact on the category.
Overall, our paperboard shipments were strong, with bleached board volume up 9% and Coated Natural Kraft volume up 1%, both largely driven by sales to food brand owners and their converting partners. Somewhat-lower pricing was driven by an unfavorable product mix in our continued ramp-up with a new product for an important food service customer.
In the third quarter, we expect segment profits to be in line with last year's very strong performance. Backlogs remained strong at 6 to 7 weeks, and we will run full for the quarter with no major planned maintenance or outages. We are gaining momentum with our ongoing pricing initiatives and expect higher volume and productivity to be the principal drivers of our performance, which we expect to improve compared to the second quarter.
The Home, Health & Beauty markets also reflected some weakness, primarily in the lawn, garden and auto categories that were impacted by unusually cold and wet weather in North America. The strong season for these products never materialized, and as a result, overall market volume was down about 20% compared to last year. In addition to this market's softness, we also saw lower volumes as we managed through customer transitions associated with the launch of our next-generation trigger sprayers in the North American market. We offset some of the impact in our home and garden business with strong performances in healthcare and personal care, both of which had high-single-digit revenue growth in the quarter.
In healthcare, our medical pumps continued to perform well in Europe, and our adherence packaging business gained momentum with both retailers and branded pharmaceutical manufacturers who are looking to launch new drugs in our packaging. This is an exciting development for the business complementing the strength we have developed in the retail channel and clinical trials with new commercial launches of branded prescription drugs.
In personal care, sales of pumps and dispensers for the global fragrance, skin care and cosmetics markets were up nicely in the second quarter. We have recently launched new products to the marketplace, including the pump-on-tube solution John referenced in his comments. And we're participating in the global launch for one of the largest brands in the skin care category. We designed the dispenser, in concert with the brand owner, and the product has launched in Asia and Europe and volume will increase significantly, with the North America launch next year. We also began re-purposing our folding carton facility in Brazil to make plastic dispensers, which will position us for strong growth in that important beauty and personal care market.
These are examples of our commercial excellence and innovation capabilities combining to drive revenue growth in key global markets.
Our earnings in the Home, Health & Beauty segment primarily reflect lower volumes in home and garden, which significantly impacted productivity and mix. Also, the folding carton business in Europe and Brazil, which we are in the process of exiting, had a modest loss in the quarter. In addition to the transition of the Brazil facility, we are working through an ongoing process with respect to our European folding carton business.
In the third quarter, we expect segment profits to be lower than last year. We will benefit from continued gains in targeted markets, including volume increases and improved pricing for some of our packaging solutions. This will be offset, in part, by losses in our folding carton business, including transition costs in Brazil.
Looking longer term, we're enthusiastic about the profit potential in this business under new leadership. We're continuing to shift the business model in this segment toward the highest-growth markets and highest-value products, including exiting folding cartons and focusing on dispensers and closures. This will help deliver consistent earnings improvement, as the margins in this part of our business have been in line with the industry and we have significant opportunities for additional growth already underway.
In our Industrial segment, we are regaining historical profitability levels in Brazil by pricing for value across the business at the same time that we continue to up the ramp for the new paperboard machine in Tres Barras. Benefits from the expansion project flowed into our results, as expected, in the second quarter as we sold more paperboard in the open market and purchased less for use in our box plants across the country.
The market for corrugated packaging was up roughly 4% overall in Brazil even as both industrial production and consumer confidence were weaker than expected. Our modest volume decreases were primarily related to the pricing actions we've taken rather than any weakness in our end markets. In India, where the inevitable move toward higher-quality corrugated packaging continued in the second quarter, our Ruby Macons business continued to see higher sales with targeted customers. We're anticipating the new paperboard machine in India will begin producing in the third quarter and then scale up to full commercialization next year.
In the third quarter, we expect to see significantly higher segment profits from increased productivity as well as lower machine startup expenses in Brazil compared to last year. Volume should also increase as we capture the benefits of additional capacity through a combination of paper sales and corrugated box manufacturing. We also expect higher pricing to offset inflation as the business moves towards targeted margin rates.
In Specialty Chemicals, our performance returned to strong levels after a challenging first quarter. We continued to generate profitable growth in high-value pine chemicals markets such as oil field solutions, asphalt additives and adhesives, as well as our leading position in carbon solutions. The addition of Resitec's pine chemicals business, previously a joint venture which we acquired last year, was also positive in the second quarter. Our technical sales and marketing efforts are accelerating, and our expectation is to see growing contribution from this business in Brazil. Profitability in the quarter was mainly impacted by additional maintenance compared to the year-ago quarter and continued growth investments in the business but at a more modest level.
Our third quarter outlook for this segment is to generate modestly higher segment profits versus the record third quarter last year. Overall, our markets remain stable. With a lighter maintenance schedule and seasonally strong period for our business, we expect to run full for the quarter. This operating leverage will drive the expected increase.
In Community Development and Land Management, we continued to see strong results from our value creation strategy with our well-located lands, including rural land sales and development activities. We are continuing to generate strong values with our rural land sales program averaging about $2,200 per acre, which is comparable to last year. And we're not seeing any slowdown associated with higher mortgage rates because our small tract buyers tend to be cash purchasers.
In the development business, we are benefiting from our diverse leadership position in the fast-growing Charleston real estate market. The investment climate, including a specialty Boeings activity in the region and the port expansion, is translating into higher home sales, the most recent numbers showing sales up 20% and prices up 10% in the residential markets. We believe we have a 12- to 18-month head start on competitors in the region and are well positioned to capture opportunities that are emerging with our Nexton and East Edisto properties as well as industrial sites across the region.
In the third quarter, we are expecting continued rural land sales progress to result in segment earnings similar to last year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Jim.
We're putting the challenging first half of the year behind us and are pleased to see commercial momentum from the second quarter extending into the second half of this year. We're looking forward to and expect significantly improved financial performance, beginning this quarter.
While a combination of factors outside of our control have impacted our business, including sluggish global macroeconomic conditions and poor weather, operational challenges have been the main factor affecting our first half performance. Those operational issues were resolved in the second quarter, and our continued improvement represents substantial upside for the remainder of the year. We're aggressively executing on our commercial strategies and overhead cost program to help offset the challenges we saw in the first half of the year to enable us to deliver the earnings and cash flow improvement we've been anticipating for the back half of the year.
First, we're driving toward higher profitability by accelerating our cost-reduction plans. We now expect overhead savings to exceed the high end of our target range for the full year. Second, with outage-related issues behind us, we're redoubling our manufacturing productivity efforts. The mills are now consistently delivering improved operating performance and we expect to realize significant operating leverage and productivity benefits. Third, we're focused on achieving the earnings and the cash flow benefits from the major strategic initiatives we've already made. Each of these major initiatives is on-track. And finally, we're delivering improved cash performance.
In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was about $200 million, an improvement of over $100 million versus the second quarter of last year. Our efforts and progress in these areas, along with contributions from our profitable growth strategies, give us good confidence in our ability to deliver renewed earnings growth beginning this quarter and modest earnings growth for the full year, as well as setting the stage for a step change improvement in earnings and cash flow and -- performance for 2014.
I'll quickly run down the financial elements of the second quarter then highlight the progress we're making on our performance-improvement initiatives. I'll then provide the key factors driving our improved earnings outlook for the third quarter.
Sales in the quarter increased 1% before currency translation. Modest overall price and mix improvement and revenues from recently acquired businesses contributed 3% but were partially offset by lower volumes and lower forestland sales.
Looking at volume, we saw solid growth and share gains in food packaging across bleached and Coated Natural Kraft paperboard solutions resulting in higher overall paperboard volumes of 4%. We also had solid volume gains in targeted personal care and healthcare packaging and in Specialty Chemicals end markets. The volume decline in the quarter primarily reflects the significant decrease we saw in home and garden markets and weakness in our European beverage and tobacco businesses. As the leader in home and garden dispensing solutions, we clearly felt the brunt of the weather-related impacts, with volumes down over 20% in the quarter.
Overall price and mix improvement in the quarter was primarily driven by the Industrial business. We realized gains from pricing initiatives we took in the first half to offset the inflation that we've experienced in Brazil over the last 2 years. Lower price and mix in our Food & Beverage segment was largely impacted by unfavorable mix, including lower volumes with a large food service customer with whom we experienced a product specification change earlier in the year.
In terms of the price increases we've implemented across bleached and CNK paperboard, we're seeing traction and expect steady improvement throughout the rest of this year.
Adjusted EBIT of $133 million in the second quarter versus $154 million a year ago on the same basis was primarily impacted by the challenging outage and issues with our SAP implementation at the Covington mill. The total impact from these items was $35 million, representing a 240-basis-point reduction to the company's second quarter adjusted gross margin of 19.7%. Overall, input cost inflation remained relatively benign through the quarter.
Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was $153 million or 10.7% of sales, which is a 190-basis-point improvement versus last year. The $26 million year-over-year improvement was driven by good progress with our overhead cost-reduction program as well as lower variable incentive compensation expense. Based on our progress with overhead cost reductions to date, we now anticipate savings in 2013 to exceed the high end of our previously communicated range of $25 million to $30 million. We expect the savings progression to build through the fourth quarter. And while our total program goal of reaching $75 million in savings in 2014 remains unchanged at this point, we're working to exceed that target as well as we continue to identify opportunities to reduce costs across the company.
Our cash performance in the quarter was very strong. Cash flow from operations of almost $200 million was significantly improved versus the prior year second quarter. Lower overall working capital levels as well as higher cash flow associated with our expanded operations in Brazil drove the $100 million-plus improvement, resulting in about $40 million of free cash flow after all CapEx and dividends.
CapEx in the first half of 2013 was $230 million, which as expected was down substantially from the $323 million we spent in the year-ago period, reflecting lower overall investments related to our expansion in Brazil. Our current outlook for full year 2013 CapEx remains approximately $500 million.
Turning to the outlook. As we stated in our press release, we expect third quarter earnings to be above year-ago levels. We largely see the risks to achieving our outlook as balanced. We're offsetting lower growth expectations for Europe and key emerging markets and continued sluggish U.S. growth by executing on our profitable growth strategies to drive volume improvements in targeted packaging and Specialty Chemicals markets. We're also executing well on the controllables and expect benefits from our overhead cost-reduction program and improved productivity to contribute to our earnings growth. Lastly, we also expect increasing levels of operating leverage in our Industrial business as our Brazil expansion achieves higher levels of production.
For the full year, we continue to expect modest earnings growth driven by the execution of our profitable growth strategies, overhead cost reductions and continued gains from our large strategic investments, including a step change in the earnings and cash flow performance in our Brazil business as well as savings from the new Covington biomass boiler. We now expect the boiler to come online ahead of schedule late in the third quarter. As this new biomass boiler replaces 2 older less-efficient units, we will realize benefits from significantly reduced energy costs, as well as lower operating and maintenance costs, including a benefit of $7 million to $10 million this year and expected annual run rate savings of $30 million to $40 million beginning in 2014.
John?
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks very much.
In summary, the momentum we expect to lead to earnings and cash flow improvement in the second half of the year is already underway. Our growth strategies are delivering top line benefits, and we're creating additional leverage from overhead cost reductions, better operating performance and the ramp-up in Brazil. In each of these areas, there was measurable progress in the second quarter and there's more to come in the second half, which gives us confidence that we're on the right track to achieve our profitable growth goals.
This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now turn to you for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Was hoping to get a little color possible on how -- the price increases in Industrial -- I'm sorry, in the Food & Beverage business, how they would typically roll through because, obviously, there was one increase you implemented earlier this year and there's another that's been announced. How -- when might we start seeing the benefits of that? And how much of it might be in place during 2014 in particular?
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks. I'll ask Jim to comment on that. I'll just say at the outset, as always, that we have a mix of contract and non-contract business, which influences the direction of the question you're raising. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Thanks, Mark. Thanks, John. I think, John said, clearly, we have businesses under contract. And I think, as we've talked previously, a little over half of our business is under contract. Some of that is tied to beginning of the year where we negotiate those increases on January 1. Other increases are tied throughout the year, some of them also indexed to market indices. And so one of the things we saw as prices declined in the back half of 2012, we also saw some of those contracts resetting in the first part of this year. As those come back up again, those will reset at the higher prices. So that's the key part in terms of the contract side of things. There's also a lot that goes on, as you know, around both the -- both customer and product mix that impacts those numbers as well. Having said all that, I think we feel very good about the pricing actions we took in the first half of this year. We've moved our non-contract business up. And clearly, as our contract business comes up, we will focus on doing that as well. We're in the throes of increasing prices again, as we speak. Market dynamics feel positive in that regard. And clearly, the value that we provide in the marketplace, we think, supports the increases as well. So we feel good about that. We should see, as I think Mark referenced, those increases impact our results in the back half of the year and then trend up nicely in 2014 as well.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
And perhaps if -- on bleached board, are the price increases effective for export business as well? Or is that a separate category?
James A. Buzzard
Again, Mark, some of those, some of our export customers are under contracts, others are not. It's really the same dynamic as we have on our domestic customers as well.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question, on Industrial. Obviously, a good price performance there. The productivity was neutral in the quarter. I'm not sure kind of what your time line is in terms of when you're expecting that productivity to really start hitting. I think it was really more intended in the back half of the year, anyway. But I guess what I was hoping for is you'll give some nice color around the boiler sales and when you expect those to flow through in '13 and '14. So I was hoping maybe you could do something similar for the Rigesa project.
John A. Luke
Jim, do you want to take that up?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Phil, I'll take that. I'll preface that by saying I've learned not to make bold predictions about major startups. But I think, having said that, we're very positive about the performance of the team in Brazil, the equipment that we have installed, the products that we're producing and the future of that operation. So as you know, these things go under extended startup curves, and we're on that curve. We're trending nicely where we anticipated we would be. I think the other thing that we referenced the last quarter that we probably haven't been as, maybe, open about or transparent about is this was more than just a new paper machine. We basically rebuilt that entire paper mill. So in addition to a new machine, we've got a brand-new lime kiln. We've got new pulping capabilities and a new wastewater treatment system. So there's a lot of complexity that goes into that operation today that candidly didn't exist previously. Having said that, as I referenced earlier in my comments, moving nicely up the curve. As you noted, we've expected those benefits to accrue in the second half of the year. We're on target to do that. And so we're very optimistic about the investment down there, what it can provide for the Industrial business for MeadWestvaco going forward.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
If I were to ask more explicitly, I think, in the past calls, we have kind of referenced maybe a $75 million savings number over time. Is it reasonable to think, similar to the boiler project, we might -- on a relative scale, we might be able to get a 1/3 of those saves starting to flow into the second half of this year? Or is it more of a 2014 story given the complexity that you mentioned?
James A. Buzzard
Yes, I mean, I think it's fair to say that we would -- should see a 1/3 of those -- of that number, as you referenced, beginning to flow into the back half of this year. Just a reminder: those savings are both productivity but it's also some growth that goes into those numbers, reintegration of the business as well. So all the areas we have identified previously as benefits to the project, we see coming forward. And as I said, we should see the beginning of that in the back half of this year but ramping up nicely in 2014.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. My second question was just on Home, Health & Beauty. You talk about these transition costs in Brazil, et cetera. I think, kind of the collective operating loss for Europe and Brazil folding carton last year was around maybe $10 million. So I guess what I'm wondering is at what point that negative $10 million kind of becomes a 0 moving forward. Just wanted to hear about the progress you're making on the European folding carton and how long to expect the Brazil transition costs.
James A. Buzzard
So I'll reference to maybe the Brazil transition costs and maybe look to Mark to talk about the Europe folding carton. In Brazil, as I noted in my comments, we're moving out of the folding carton business and expanding into primary plastics. That's really going to probably take us at least 9 months to go through that process. We want to make sure, as we exit out of the folding carton business, we support our customers appropriately in making sure that they can transition to other suppliers going forward. And at the same time, as we move that facility to make plastics products, building out that infrastructure, as well as moving the equipment in, we do it in a way that we're supporting current customers as well. So we have a very detailed project plan laid out to do that. We will begin that implementation towards the end of Q3 and should see that ramp more fully through the 6 months after that. So by end of Q1, Q2 next year, we should be fully operational as a primary plastics business in Brazil.
E. Mark Rajkowski
And on the European side, we're in process with the marketing efforts. So that is underway, and we have high expectations for that as well.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Mark, one last question for you, just on the CapEx front. The $500 million for this year, I believe that includes $100 million for the Covington boiler. So wondering if you have any preliminary thoughts around CapEx for next year. I think, in the past, you've talked to kind of $350 million as more of a normalized level. I'm curious if we're going to hit normalized next year, if there's any other things in the works that we need to be aware of?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, I -- Phil, I think $350 million to $400 million is a good range. I mean, we still have some investment that we're going to be seeing in India relative to expanding some capacity there, as well as some capital for our Resitec business that we acquired remaining interest in at the end of last year. But I -- so I think that's a good range to think about.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
The market share you ceded in Brazil given your price increases, just curious, was that in line with your expectations as you kind of went through that process? Is it reasonable to expect that you'll regain that share over the next few quarters? And also if I could, what is your market expectation for demand for the back half of this year in Brazil?
James A. Buzzard
I'll pick that one up. In terms of our expectation of the price increase, I think, clearly we were out in leading that price increase in Brazil. And so as such, we can anticipate we'd see some impact. It's interesting to note that some of the business that did transition away from us is already coming back and, I think, a clear recognition of the value that we bring to the marketplace. So overall, I think that the loss of business will be about where we've anticipated it to be but, as we showed in the waterfall, good progress on moving prices. Including the back half of this year, I think the markets in the first half have grown around 4% in the country. Lots going on in Brazil today, so I'm not sure I can make a great prediction, but I would continue to see expected growth there. I think the really important story is the long term in Brazil. We remain very bullish about our business down there. And Brazil is an economy for the long haul, so we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that long-term growth with the investments that we're making both in the Industrial side of the business, also importantly, as Mark noted, in Resitec and in our beauty and personal care business as well.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And then just a second question, maybe for John. Last quarter when you had your press release and your conference call, you outlined a couple of very specific initiatives, one on the cost side, one on land. On the cost side, clearly, you're executing and it sounds like you are tracking above the upper end of your guidance before. Can you just give us a comparable update on what's happening with the land business too?
John A. Luke
Sure, I'd be happy to. I think it's suffice to say that we're very pleased with the interest that we're seeing in the land business. We are moving along aggressively there exploring different alternatives. And we continue, as we commented in April, to be very focused on doing everything we can to complete a transaction before the end of the year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
Steven Aragon - CLSA Limited, Research Division
This is Steve Aragon filling-in for Mark Connelly. My first question is on the -- you guys expect a continued price improvement in industrial packaging. So are these price improvements going to be, like, a keeping up with cost inflation on labor and input costs? Or is it going to be, like, on top of this?
James A. Buzzard
Steven, this is Jim. I think, as we've talked previously, pricing obviously moves up in not necessarily in concert with inflation, it comes up more in chunks as you move pricing. So having said that, I think, as we've noted previously, we've gotten behind a little bit on inflation in the last couple of years. This price increase will move us above what current inflation is but helps restore that margin level. And then going forward, we will have to be vigilant about watching inflation and watching pricing and productivity to make sure that we're not only protecting our margins but we're continuing to grow them as well. And so that's something the team is very, very focused on.
Steven Aragon - CLSA Limited, Research Division
Okay. And my last question is on for the Home, Health & Beauty re-purposing of Brazilian folding carton business, is -- what kind of addition to the margins are you going to see at -- in, like, 9 months from now after everything is complete with the re-purposing?
James A. Buzzard
I -- Steve, I think it's a little hard for us to make a margin prediction 9 months from now. We're just beginning to start up that business. It think, suffice it to say that Brazil today is the second largest beauty and personal care market in the world, exhibiting very strong growth rates. The products we sell in today are well received by both our customers and the end consumer, and we've seen very dramatic growth. So this really positions us to shift our products into the higher-growth, higher-margin primary plastics business, which has strong margin potential going forward. I think we'll have a better feel for that as we get into the middle part of next year. But we see nothing that says that the margins in that business won't be similar to -- at the very least, to the margins we produce in primary plastics around the rest of the globe today.
John A. Luke
Yes. And Steve, it's John. I think Jim has answered that very well. I would just punctuate that by saying that, as we've comment, the underlying performance of that business today is masked by the turmoil in the folding carton markets, some of the home and garden seasonality issues and the aforementioned transition in Brazil. But we're making excellent progress in that business, most particularly in the healthcare and beauty and personal care side. And as we look to the coming year and getting that Brazilian business up to -- ramping up in operations and fully capitalizing on the market opportunities, we would expect you to begin to see a dramatically improved margin profile for that overall segment, one that we'll be very pleased with.

Next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I guess, looking at the board business in your backlogs up 6, 7 weeks, how sustainable do you think those are? How much of it might have had to do with the issues at Covington? And just what do you think is driving the overall pickup in industry backlogs? Can you be a little bit more specific versus what you've mentioned prior to this in the call?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Gail. In terms of the impact on Covington on overall backlogs, I think it's pretty modest. I think, if you look at the industry backlogs, they're as strong as we've seen them in a long time, frankly. So we would normally see some seasonality in the fourth quarter and I expect we will see some of that again this year. But in terms of our specific situations, we've talked previously we really have targeted our products into the higher-value markets. So in a place like China, for example, we continue to see good growth because we're focused on markets that require the performance, through our customers filling the lines, that we can deliver. It's focused on the cleanliness around food protection and those sorts of applications. So we continue to expect growth in those sorts of markets. I think, additionally, clearly, some of the tightness is caused by some of the reduction in supply that's occurred in North America in 2013. So on balance, we feel positive about the future strengths of the bleach board marketplace.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay, but there's no segment, such as food, coming back from a weak 2012, or anything that is worth highlighting?
John A. Luke
No. I think this reflects overall market conditions.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And are you seeing any modest recovery in the home and garden area in the third quarter? Or is that just completely lost business?
James A. Buzzard
Gail, it's really a completely lost business. Those markets -- the strength is really around the spring season. And once that gone -- it -- is gone, it won't replicate itself until next year. So we're really not -- we're seeing some modest improvement on the hard surface cleaning business and some of the trigger business, but the fundamental lawn, garden and all those markets from the spring, those will not be replicated.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And just one last question. At the very beginning of the year, you announced a increased buyback authorization. Share count's drifting up, but I just -- I'm assuming you haven't been doing much with it. So can you just give us an update there and how you view that program and the targets that you talked about at the beginning of the year?
John A. Luke
Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Gail. We had increased the buyback to -- authorization to give us some flexibility. And certainly, we will intend to use that to maintain a share count that is more in line with our target. So as that creeps up as -- through option exercises and such, we'll bring that back in-line.

Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I guess, first question I had is on the Food & Beverage business. And it's nice to see some sequential pickup. You mentioned you'll be flat versus the year-ago quarter, but the year-ago quarter was also down versus 2011. You have some volume momentum, it would appear. You have a little bit of pricing. You have the Covington savings. So I was curious if you could parse out what factors will make for only-flat quarter year-on-year in food. I'm guessing the biggest thing will be the lagged price effect in bleached, but is there any other things, either with SAP or food service, you can call out? And I had a couple of follow-ons.
John A. Luke
Jim, do you want to take that up?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, George. I think you've identified some of the key drivers. We will see some of the lagged effect from the pricing that I referenced in my earlier comments. And again, we feel very positive about where that's going, and we'll begin to see more momentum as we come out of the third quarter. I think, in some of the other areas, inflation remains fairly benign, so we won't see much of a negative impact there. So I think, all in all, it should be a very solid quarter for us.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Is there a way to parse the food service impact, Jim?
James A. Buzzard
I mean, clearly, that is an impact for us. As I think Mark or I referenced in our comments, we're going through this transition with a new set of specifications with an important customer. That's going very well, and we're seeing momentum gains. So there will be some impact. I think, all these transitions, it's a little hard to predict the pace at which they will move. I will say that every month is better and we're moving nicely along the path. And we would certainly feel, by the end of the quarter, we should be in very good shape there.
E. Mark Rajkowski
It's certainly a drag, still, year-over-year in the quarter itself.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Understood. 2 other questions. In Home, Health & Beauty, Jim, I think you enumerated a lot of things that are going on in the business. And obviously, it's -- your business isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison versus peers in specialty packaging and dispensing. And you have a lot of non-one-off factors that are hitting you this year. If you look at comparable segments in personal care or fragrance and cosmetic or in pharmaceutical dispensing, are your margins comparable with your peers from your own benchmarking? And if not, how -- could you help us size what the gap might be and how you'll close that over a couple of years?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, George. I think, to your point, we have a mixed business, at least at this point in time, which we, as I noted, are moving to address. But if we look at the primary plastics, dispensing caps and closures business, we parse that by end market, as we do. We feel very good about our relative performance given our competition. And we may be up slightly in one, down slightly in another, somewhat based on product mix or various things, but all in, we feel very positive where we are in that business. I think our efforts are driven on how do we improve that. And so our investments in emerging markets, we've talked about Brazil; the ongoing investments were making in innovation; clearly the medical plastics, progress we are making, where the margins are very attractive for us, all of those are things where we see, in spite of feeling good about where we are to date, making continued investments in improvement going forward. And we have very high confidence that, that business will continue to improve going forward.
John A. Luke
I think that -- and I think, George, I would just add that we have a number of what we hope and expect will be significant opportunities we're exploring through our innovation activities to that business as well. I think one of the things we would like to do as we move towards the coming year is provide an opportunity, either on a future call or an different, separate meeting, for Pete Durette to speak with you about the progress that is being made with the underlying business and his overall observations on the business, which are really quite positive.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes. And just to emphasize a couple of points. But I think, relative to the margin structure in beauty and personal care, in medical plastics, they're very much in line with competition. And importantly, we are seeing good growth, as John mentioned, related to innovation, new products as well as excellent efforts around our commercial excellence programs. So we do, as John said, expect to see good margin expansion in that segment in 2014.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes. Just back to home, healthcare and beauty briefly. Can you give us some sense of kind of your target margins and timeline for reaching those?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Mark, we -- this is a -- again, this is a business that -- where we expect EBITDA margins to be in the high teens. And we expect to make good progress on that next year, as we said. There is a lot of DA in this business, there's a lot of depreciation and amortization. So as you look at the absolute EBIT, it is a little bit misleading. But this is -- the other thing that, at least at this point, tends to tamp down the margins is the fact that we got a relatively sizable but still nascent inherents [ph] business. And that's a business that we think has great potential. We are growing it. And right now, we're kind of at that tipping point, right? So it's roughly an $80 million business that has solid gross margins, but we've made a lot of investment in SG&A, whether it's product innovation, and in sales and marketing. But as that business grows and expands, there's tremendous leverage that will be a great compliment to the product innovation and growth that we expect to see in beauty and personal care. Jim talked about Brazil. John talked about new product innovation. So we have great confidence in our ability to profitably grow that business in next year but certainly in the years to come.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then just over, briefly, in industrial packaging. I wondered if you could give us some sense of what the margin targets there might be or EBIT or EBITDA. I'm -- just I'm curious. Klabin has been up in the low- to mid-30s recently, and I'm wondering whether that's a reasonable number for you guys. It seems like it ought to be, as you don't use any recycled fiber, which is a big issue in Brazil. And then also in that business, is it possible we get a sense of what Ruby Macons is doing to margins and sales in that segment so that we could see just what Brazil is doing versus what you're doing in India?
John A. Luke
Mark, do you want to take that up?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes. Mark, I think your intuition is absolutely right. We expect the -- our business in Brazil to have margins that are very much in line with what Klabin reports over time. We're going to be ramping those up in the back half of this year, and we expect further improvement in 2014. And as it relates to Ruby Macons, we'll give you a little bit better breakdown of that business going forward, but it is -- given the early stage in terms of ramping up some of that capacity, it has been a little bit of a drag overall on that segment.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Is that an EBIT drag, Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I'm sorry?
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Is it an EBIT drag? EBIT negative?
E. Mark Rajkowski
It's -- no, it -- no, it's not, no. It's making money, but it's not at the same -- it's got a lower margin structure than we have in Rigesa.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And what's approximate sales in India right now, just on an annual run rate?
E. Mark Rajkowski
It's roughly $80 million, $85 million.

Next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
First item, just to kind of get, and I'm not going to tie you down to an exact number, but if we look at the Food & Beverage segment, we had a $48 million drop in profit year-over-year, and $35 million of that you've called out to be Covington. And so if we, said let's take that and add that back in, that would get you to 87, because that's going to go away. And when you talk about $30 million to $40 million of improvement from Covington as you get the biomass boiler going, should we think of that, on top of that, kind of 87 number recognized in the course that [ph] each quarter has a lot of seasonality and there's pricing, et cetera, going on?
[Technical Difficulty]
James A. Buzzard
Chip, you're breaking up a little. But I think one thing to remember is the $30 million to $40 million that Mark talked about was an annual number. And so roughly, $8 million to $10 million per quarter. But yes, I think, as we have turned the corner at Covington and begun to operate at the levels we'd expect ourselves to be doing, that -- those -- that will return to us and then the biomass boiler returns will be added to that sort of a number.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
And then also on -- when we look at Rigesa or, more specifically, industrial packaging, you mentioned obviously a nice improvement in the year-over-year number. How do you think you'll look versus the second quarter given what you're seeing down, especially with the ramp-up of Brazil?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Chip, this is Mark. We will see a sequential improvement in operating profit in Brazil for the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Got you. Okay, that's very helpful. And then the last one, Mark, is a really picky one. On the slides, it mentions in SG&A and in cost of sales, I think, a total of, like, $9 million in restructuring charges, but then on the [indiscernible] EBIT, the total was $5 million, so it didn't quite add up. And I was wondering if you -- whether it would be different in the restructuring charges and gross margin and SG&A being different than what it is in EBIT?
E. Mark Rajkowski
You kind of broke up there, Chip, but if I understand your question, you're pointing out at what you believe is a difference between total restructuring charges versus what gets accounted for in COGS and SG&A?
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Yes. If you can -- Slide 4, in footnote 1, it says $6 million was in adjusted gross margin and then [indiscernible], so that's a total of $9 million. But if you look at the footnote 3, for just the EBIT, it says 5. And I would think it would add up to 9, as opposed to be $5 million.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Well they should add. You're right there. So we'll get back to you on that one, okay? But I certainly agree with you: In concept, they should foot.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
And then one last one on the pension situation as we look to next year. I mean, obviously, you guys have a fabulous pension situation, but as you look at the higher interest rates on the 10-year, and let's say they persist, do you see any meaningful change in that pension benefit, whether it would even directionally go up or down?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I think we've done a pretty good job, Chip, over the last several years of using a liability management strategy. So we've got -- our liabilities are pretty well funded with a lot of fixed income instruments that are intended to mirror the future payout. So we would expect to have muted impact from interest rate changes going forward.

And our last question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
A couple of questions. Are you seeing any impact in the export market in bleached board, specifically, from the ramp-up of the Chinese capacity?
James A. Buzzard
That was -- this is Jim. We're not seeing it at this point in time. And I think, as I referenced in my comments, we're actually seeing reasonably good growth in China. And again it's really the markets that we tend to play in with our products and the value we provide. So as we speak, no, we have not seen an impact from their ramp-up.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And then you talked about taking some share from corrugated in the club stores. Can you talk about if that's more in the bleached board -- with the bleached board product, or the CNK product? And maybe can you just give us a sense of how many incremental tons you guys think are -- you're selling as a result of the market share wins this year?
James A. Buzzard
So Alex, it would primarily be in the CNK. And really, the value that we're providing there is a -- as you know, it's great in terms of the strength of that product and -- but also, it gives a great printing surface in the aesthetics. And so we're seeing moves in some of the glass beverage markets. We're seeing moves in frozen food, and we're seeing moves in the dry food categories as well. So really, winning in a number of places, with good opportunity ahead of us. I frankly don't have a number for you that would say the number of tons tied to all of the initiatives that we have going on. But we can look at that for you.
Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
That's helpful, Jim. And just one last quick one from me, for Mark. It seems like the corporate expense number is moving around a little bit here. And I may have missed this, but do you have an full year outlook for what the corporate expense line should be for '13?
E. Mark Rajkowski
No, we haven't given that, Alex, but the -- we're making good progress in terms of taking our costs down, and we did have some benefit from lower-incentive accruals this past quarter. So as we look out to Q3, we'd expect to be at a level that was slightly below where we were in the second quarter last year, which also had the benefit of a reversal of comp expense. So all in, I think we're trending at lower levels in terms of our true corporate department spend. And we'd expect to see that continue and, frankly, improve slightly as we move throughout the course of the year.
