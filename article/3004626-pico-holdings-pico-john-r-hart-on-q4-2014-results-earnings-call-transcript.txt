Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to PICO Holdings' Analysts and Investor Update Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Mueller, Investor Relations for PICO Holdings. Please go ahead.
Lisa Mueller - Investor Relations, PICO Holdings, Inc.
Thank you, Drew, and welcome to all of you who have joined us to discuss PICO Holdings' financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2014, and strategic plans and outlook for 2015. Our earnings release which we issued earlier this morning is available on our investor website at investor.picoholdings.com under Press Releases.
I am here today with John Hart, President and CEO of PICO Holdings; and Max Webb, Chief Financial Officer. John Hart will provide prepared remarks, and then both John and Max will be available to answer your questions.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. 2014 was a critical year for our investment in Northstar. In the first quarter, crush margins were at a historic high. Unfortunately, this occurred during the worst winter in Minnesota in 100 years, which severely limited Northstar's ability to deliver product. We also decided to invest more capital to double storage capacity and increase output by nearly 17%. This investment provided greater operating leverage and flexibility, and increased the value of the plant.
Today, Northstar has a new highly efficient, strategically located crush plant that we believe could have greater value to a strategic buyer. We began to review strategic alternatives in the fourth quarter of 2014 and decided this year to engage the investment banking firm of Stephens, Inc., to execute a marketing process to effectuate a transaction.
UCP has grown homebuilding revenues 300% since their IPO to $155 million in 2014. Earnings are a function and part of scale, community count, and project maturity. We are seeing consistent improvement in all areas, and with ongoing management initiatives to reduce cost, we expect continued robust revenue growth combined with profitability going forward. As long as the outlook for housing remains positive, this should lead to a share price that trades closer to fair value.
In addition, we are confident that UCP's management is exploring all avenues to extract maximum value for shareholders.
Value creation at Vidler Water results from their development activities, but in large measure to growth in their markets. The Nevada State Demographer estimates that due to the Tesla project the counties adjacent to the Tahoe Reno Industrial Park, which include Lyon, Carson City, Douglas, and Churchill counties will exceed combined current population estimates by 44,000 over the next 20 years. Washoe County will see an increased population of over 147,000.
It has been estimated by the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada that 51,000 primary and secondary jobs from 2015 to 2019 will move to the Western Nevada region. Overall, Nevada's job base has expanded faster than the nation for the last 20 months and as of March 2014 is number two in the nation.
The lower basin space of the Colorado River which includes Nevada and Arizona are in the 15th year of drought. Long term drought conditions combined with population growth above the national average in Nevada and Arizona increased the likelihood of water shortages for current users and to support growth.
We estimate that Vidler's water portfolio could have a value of approximately 2.2 times carrying cost. This estimate does not include 5,000 acre-feet of Fish Springs Ranch water, which has not been approved for importation at this time or that there will be any more water permitted from our 100,000 Lincoln County applications. The timing of monetization is uncertain, but typically when water markets reach this equilibrium, dramatic price changes occur, which can result in significantly higher valuations.
We believe that we are selling at a discount from our potential value. We also recognize that for redeploying capital and enhancing our share price, an attractive opportunity might be to purchase our own stock.
We are now ready to open the call to your questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we do have a question from Chip Skinner from The Royce Funds. Please go ahead.

Thank you. You mentioned regarding UCP that that management team was also exploring all options. Did you mean to say that exploring all options to improve profitability within the company or something along the lines of what PICO is considering with the agriculture asset?
John R. Hart - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
UCP's board and management is always looking at opportunities to enhance shareholder value which in addition to making improvements in terms of operational efficiencies and continuing to grow their market would include other type of transactions that might beat the enhanced shareholder value.
