Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the LinkedIn Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

I will now turn the call over to Matt Sonefeldt. Thank you. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Matt Sonefeldt - Head-Investor Relations
Good afternoon. Welcome to LinkedIn's second quarter 2015 results call. Joining me today to discuss our results are CEO, Jeff Weiner; and CFO, Steve Sordello.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements relating to expected member growth and engagement, our product offerings including mobile and our product deployment process, results of our R&D efforts, revenue including revenue growth rates of our three product lines: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, integration efforts regarding our lynda.com acquisition, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, share dilution, taxes, the product mix between online and field sales, churn rates and expenses.
Actual results may materially differ from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the section entitled Risk Factors in our Quarterly and Annual Reports, and we refer you to these filings.
Also, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables in our earnings release. This conference call is also being broadcast on the web and is available through the Investor Relations' section of the LinkedIn website.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Jeff Weiner.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Matt, and welcome to today's conference call. I'll start by summarizing the operating results for the second quarter of 2015, and I'll recap some of the key milestones that demonstrate the execution of our strategy. I'll then turn it over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers and outlook.
Q2 was a solid quarter for LinkedIn as we delivered greater member and customer value. We continue to execute against an ambitious R&D roadmap that has led to accelerated product innovation with new product rollouts throughout the remainder of this year. We also made progress working through transitions with our Talent Solutions sales force and the evolution of our Marketing Solutions business. Additionally, we have seen some early success integrating lynda.com.
For Q2, overall revenues grew 33% to $712 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $163 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.55.
Q2 cumulative members grew 21% to 380 million, unique visiting members grew 16% to an average of 97 million per month, and member page views grew 37%, an acceleration over Q1's growth rate and well ahead of unique member growth. Mobile continues to grow at double the rate of overall member activity, and now represents 52% of all traffic to LinkedIn.
LinkedIn's value proposition is simple: connect to opportunity. For our members, we do this in three ways: first, connect to your professional world; second, stay informed through professional news and knowledge; and third, get hired and build your career. Our long-term investments in these areas are designed with one goal in mind: transform the member experience to increase the value delivered to each professional on LinkedIn. Here are a few highlights of the progress we've made on delivering these value propositions since our last earnings call.
In Q2, we continued to invest in improving the quality and relevance of the flagship LinkedIn experience. These investments resulted in a 60% increase in year-over-year feed engagement and search growing meaningfully faster than overall traffic. And we've also taken steps to improve the relevance of communication across LinkedIn, recognizing that when it comes to your inbox, less is more. The results so far have been very encouraging. For every 10 emails we used to send, we've removed four of them. Member complaints regarding emails have been cut in half as a result of this effort. You can expect to see more from us in this area as the year continues.
Additionally, our continuing investment in these foundations set the stage for re-envisioning our entire core mobile and desktop experience. Over time, our flagship offering will increasingly focus on five key pillars: the Feed, Profile, My Network, Messaging, and Search.
The global expansion of LinkedIn is also a core part of connecting members to their professional world. We recently reached the 10 million member milestone in China, up from 4 million last February, and China is now our second largest market for new signups behind the U.S. We have built strategic relationships with many of the largest Chinese web platforms including WeChat, QQMail, Alibaba, and Alipay. Also this month, our local Chinese development team beta-launched a new app called Chitu. Chitu, our first professional networking app designed exclusively for the Chinese market, is currently invitation-only. Despite that, early interest is strong, reaching tens of thousands of new signups in the first three days since launch.
Connecting our members to relevant news, knowledge, and skills is another strategic priority integral to creating member value. Our publishing platform is a key element in this effort. In Q2, the number of long-form posts per week increased to more than 130,000, and we now have more than 1 million unique members publishing long-form content on the site, a scale that we believe is unprecedented in the history of professional publishing. In addition, our Influencer platform continues to see strong usage by professional luminaires, and we were pleased to see both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush begin publishing on LinkedIn as they launched their presidential campaigns.
This collective professional knowledge, along with third-party content, is distributed through Pulse. In Q2, we launched a completely revamped version of the app. The new Pulse offers a more personalized news experience, powered by your professional world, and has quickly risen to become one of the most popular business news apps.
Finally, in May, we completed the acquisition of lynda.com. We believe this could be one of LinkedIn's most transformational initiatives as it has the potential to improve the member experience across the entire platform. lynda.com now has more than 6,800 total courses and 280,000 videos across five languages. The content team has continued to launch new features, and is adding more than 150 courses per month.
We have already tested early integration efforts and the results so far have exceeded our expectations. One promotional campaign delivered to LinkedIn members outperformed our expectations by 7x in generating new subscribers, an early signal of what we can achieve when applying LinkedIn's scale, data and distribution to lynda.com's content.
Lastly, helping members get hired is quickly emerging as one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on LinkedIn. Unique visitors to jobs-related pages continue to materially accelerate, up 40% year-over-year in June, compared to approximately 10% in January. This growth has been driven by two factors. First, we continue to increase the scale of jobs on LinkedIn, with approximately 4 million active job listings today, compared to roughly 1 million a year ago. Second, we have built a much improved experience for jobseekers. Our revamped Job Search app now has 3 million activations, up from approximately 1 million during the first quarter.
Creating value for our members enables us to transform the way our customers hire, market, and sell on a global basis through our three diverse product lines. In Q2, Talent Solutions grew 38% to $443 million, inclusive of Learning & Development revenue from lynda.com; Marketing Solutions was up 32% to $140 million; and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions, increased 22% to $128 million.
For Talent Solutions, Q2 saw solid progress against our broader efforts to position the business for long-term success. As we discussed on our last call, Q1 was a period of operational transition as we re-segmented a significant portion of our sales force. We are pleased with how the sales force executed last quarter, demonstrated by deeper customer relationships and an improvement in churn year-over-year. In addition, our customers will benefit from our increased investment in R&D in 2015, as we roll out significant improvements and new products at our annual Talent Connect conference in October.
For Marketing Solutions, we continue to create a more scalable business and become the most effective platform for marketers to engage professionals. Sponsored Updates had a strong Q2, more than doubling year-over-year. This offering now accounts for nearly 50% of all Marketing Solutions revenue. LinkedIn Lead Accelerator, launched in February, is seeing good initial demand. Going forward, the team is prioritizing simplifying the product and fine-tuning the go-to-market strategy.
In Sales Solutions, for the past several months, the R&D team has focused on iterating our flagship Sales Navigator product, while the field sales team continues to educate the market about the benefits of social selling. During the quarter, we saw dramatic improvements in Sales Navigator customer satisfaction, as measured through NPS. Also, while early in the quarter, we have seen customers renewing at higher than expected levels despite higher Sales Navigator prices following last year's flagship launch.
Lastly, LinkedIn @ Work, our newest value proposition, is off to a good start. The recently launched Elevate helps employees curate and share high quality content with their networks. Members using Elevate are sharing content at a 3 times higher rate than before, and as a result, employers are seeing higher engagement with company pages and job views. Blue chip companies including Unilever, AXA, and Visa are among pilot customers building a deeper relationship with LinkedIn through Elevate, and we are excited to build on these initial contracts.
Finally, a word about our talent, our number one operating priority as a company. Summer kicked off intern season at LinkedIn, and this year we have nearly 350 interns across our global offices, up from 70 just four years ago. Our world class internship program has emerged as an important pipeline for hiring world class talent, and a very high percentage of our interns convert into full-time employees. More broadly, recruiting for technical and other talent remains one of our core strengths.
And now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Jeff. Today I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, and the tax impacts of these adjustments.
During the second quarter, LinkedIn demonstrated solid performance as we made progress on several long-term strategic initiatives, including improving our flagship member experience, making progress on Talent Solutions sales force re-segmentation, and closing the lynda.com acquisition.
With respect to members, we continued to see positive trends supported by building momentum in our three value propositions. Unique visiting members grew 16%, outpaced by member page view growth of 37%. This resulted in an 18% year-over-year increase in page views-per-unique visitor, our highest rate of increase since early 2013.
In the quarter, we generated $712 million in sales, an increase of 33% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, growth would have been 38%, and Q2 results included contribution from lynda of $18 million in revenue.
Within Talent Solutions, Learning & Development is now reported as a separate product category along with our core Hiring products. Overall, Talent Solutions showed strong performance, with revenue of $443 million growing 38% year-over-year, representing 62% of sales versus 60% last year.
Within Hiring, revenue grew 32% year-over-year. The business exhibited operational improvement as we leveraged our new customer segments that rolled out during the first quarter. As a reminder, after a 2014 pilot, we proactively re-segmented enterprise customers during Q1 to better align reps with customer needs.
Positive momentum from the customer segment changes built throughout the quarter, leading to a year-over-year increase in our net ratio, which measures add-on and renewals net of churn. Churn also decreased on both a year-on-year and sequential basis, an encouraging sign with respect to customer success. Given the ratable nature of the business, improvement should build gradually throughout the year. And finally, we continued to see strength in acquiring new customers, ending with over 37,000 total accounts.
Our online channel is where small companies turn to LinkedIn on a self-serve basis, and in Q2, we began to achieve more stable growth. Job Seeker and Recruiter Lite subscriptions showed strength, powered by the broader changes we've made to the Premium Subscription platform.
Learning & Development contributed $18 million after the mid-May close of lynda. We are increasingly encouraged by lynda's long-term potential as we gain greater familiarity with lynda's core assets. In addition to the consumer-oriented campaigns Jeff mentioned, the nascent enterprise business has already exceeded early expectations.
Marketing Solutions grew 32% to $140 million, representing a similar 20% of sales as last year.
Sponsored Updates remained strong during the quarter, now contributing approximately 45% of overall Marketing Solutions. 80% of Sponsored Updates now comes from mobile, benefiting from faster overall mobile engagement growth and a product that creates a high quality member experience. Growth exceeded 100% year-over-year, due to a combination of positive auction-based pricing dynamics and greater demand.
Weakness in CPM-based premium display sold by our sales force somewhat offset Sponsored Updates strength. Display revenue continued to decline, decreasing approximately 30% year-over-year versus a 10% decline in the first quarter. Our investment continues to move away from display and towards product areas that best leverage our unique data assets to maximize member experience and customer ROI. As a result, we continue to shift our portfolio towards native content marketing and lead generation.
To that end, we continue to evolve our recently launched Lead Accelerator product. Demand is strong and has exceeded our initial customer acquisition expectations, although utilization has been varied. With Lead Accelerator, we are bringing a completely new value proposition to market requiring quick product iteration and a streamlining of the customer experience. In that vein, we will shift to primarily focus on annual subscriptions where we substantially higher renewal rates versus shorter-term contracts. We expect this focus to increase long-term customer success.
Premium Subscriptions grew 22% to $128 million, contributing 18% of revenue versus 20% last year. Consistent with past quarters, our general subscription product supplied the majority of premium revenue. Our strategy remains focused on aligning paying members with a product that best fits their needs from a simplified set of SKUs.
In addition, Premium Subscriptions increasingly acts as a platform to identify opportunities that can drive increased member value. This first occurred with Recruiter to serve talent acquisition professionals, then with Sales Navigator for salespeople, and more recently with Job Seeker as we've come to better understand the value of using LinkedIn to get hired. While we have new initiatives in flight within Premium Subscriptions, our belief is that this line becomes smaller as a percentage of revenue over time as successful initiatives move into other revenue lines.
With respect to Sales Solutions, revenue continued to grow significantly faster than overall Premium Subscriptions. We are encouraged by the quickly improving core product experience as represented by a large increase in NPS scores. Importantly, business generated from field sales exceeded business generated from self-serve for the first time in Q2. And lastly, though still early, data from the second half is encouraging with respect to grandfathered customers renewing at a higher price point versus when the flagship product launched last year.
In terms of geography, the impact from currency and continued weakness in EMEA Marketing Solutions resulted in a decline in the percentage of revenue generated outside the U.S., from 40% last year to 38% in the second quarter. With respect to channel, field sales drove 62% of revenue compared with 60% last year.
Moving to the non-GAAP financials, adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, a 23% margin. This performance was better than our original expectation, driven by core business outperformance along with an earlier than anticipated close of the lynda acquisition. Excluding the impact of lynda, our standalone margin would have been 26%, a 3% difference.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $99 million while stock compensation was $145 million. The lynda acquisition accounted for a one-time $22 million impact on stock compensation. On taxes, we recorded a GAAP benefit of $26 million, and we continue to have a 23% non-GAAP rate.
GAAP net loss was $68 million, resulting in a $0.53 loss per share, compared to a loss of $1 million and $0.01 loss last year. Approximately $31 million of the GAAP pre-tax expense was related to one-time lynda costs.
Non-GAAP net income was $71 million, resulting in earnings of $0.55 per share, compared with $63 million and $0.51 last year.
The balance sheet remains well-positioned with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities. Operating cash flow was $226 million versus $128 million a year ago, and free cash flow was $153 million, up from $32 million last year.
I will end the call with guidance for the third quarter and an updated outlook for 2015.
For the third quarter, we expect revenue between $745 million and $750 million, 32% growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $146 million to $148 million, a 20% margin at the midpoint. And for non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $0.43 per share.
For the full year, we expect revenue of approximately $2.94 billion, 33% year-over-year growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $665 million, a 23% margin. And for non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $2.19 per share.
Relative to guidance, I want to provide additional color on current trends in our business. In Talent Solutions, we are encouraged by improving execution from the first quarter's customer re-segmentation as well as changes in our online jobs and subs products. In addition, we are excited about a robust product pipeline that will add major improvements to our core products for the first time in several years.
In Marketing Solutions, three dynamics are at play. First, Sponsored Updates remains strong and will soon become the majority of the business, powered in particular by the shift to mobile. Second, premium display continues to face headwinds in light of deteriorating secular trends. And third, with Lead Accelerator, we are taking a more focused approach in the second half, and believe this focus will maximize long-term success.
In Sales Solutions, the improving customer experience sets a good foundation for upcoming product enhancements and our annual Sales Connect customer event.
Specific to Lynda, as we said last quarter, we will focus the rest of 2015 on consumer and enterprise pilots to better inform our longer-term approach. In 2016, we plan to implement wider scale integration across both our consumer platform and enterprise go-to-market.
We now expect approximately $90 million contribution for the full year versus original guidance for approximately $40 million, impacted by an earlier than expected close, a lower than anticipated deferred revenue write-down, and moderate over-performance in the early-going.
With respect to adjusted EBITDA margin, we expect lynda to have a 4% downward impact for Q3 and 3% for the full year versus LinkedIn on a standalone business.
Including lynda, additional guidance incorporates: depreciation of approximately $69 million for Q3 and $278 million for the full year, with third quarter amortization of approximately $47 million and $135 million for the full year; stock based compensation of approximately $128 million for Q3 and $510 million for the full year; other expense of approximately $16 million for Q3 and $60 million for the full year, including GAAP-only convertible accretion of $12 million in Q3 and $47 million for the full year; a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for Q3 and the full year.
And for share count, on a GAAP basis, we expect 131 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q3, and an average of 129 million for the full year. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 133 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q3 and an average of 131 million for the full year.
In closing, we are pleased with our execution this quarter. Members continue to increase engagement in our core product experience, setting us up well for much larger innovation across the product portfolio. With respect to revenue, we made good progress in what was a transitional quarter within Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and the early integration of lynda. Each of these initiatives represents an important step in realizing our multi-year strategy, and we will continue to invest in creating value for both members and customers.
Thank you for your time. And we'll now take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And your first question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for the question. On Sales Navigator, I'm just wondering what the revenue was in the quarter. And if you could give us a sense of the average ARPU that you're seeing for recent renewals? And then lastly, on Sales Navigator, how many sales people are currently selling the product? Thank you.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, for the revenue, it was about $43 million, $44 million in the quarter, which is about 35% of our Premium Subscription line, continuing to grow more rapidly than Premium Subscriptions. On the sales head count side, we're at about a range of 240 quota-carrying full-time, that's about 60% year-on-year for Sales Solutions.
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
And the ARPU?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
The ARPU for Sales Solutions?
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Yeah. Like, for the renewals, what have you been seeing on average ballpark?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, for the field sales side, we're at about $1,200 per year for the flagship product.
John R Blackledge - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.

And your next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks very much. A couple on Marketing Solutions, if I could. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color, Steve, on your comments about a more focused approach. Is this referring to a product design or pricing or kind of go-to-marketing strategy?
And then secondly, on the weakness in display, is this a function of budget shift for these advertisers from displaying the Sponsored Updates or are you losing marketers altogether? I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the drivers there? Thanks very much?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. For the Lead Accelerator, I think what we've seen so far, it's a very early product, really good demand, which I think is a strong signal for the market opportunity. What's needed is more education, because this is a whole new B2B value prop that we're taking to market. And so what we've learned so far that we want to shift to in the second half is to have more focus towards kind of higher end customers, longer-term customers where we've seen much significantly higher renewal rate. And so we believe that focus in terms of matching the value prop, taking those learnings more broad-based later will be the smarter route to go.
In terms of the display, as you know, this is an area historically that we had expected to deteriorate and actually held up for a longer period of time. Beginning Q1, we started to see a deterioration, about 10% year-on-year, about 30% â a little over north of 30% here in Q2. I think most of that is a secular shift. I think partly due to our focus as well. We're primarily focused on native content advertising, Sponsored Updates, which is growing very rapidly in excess of 100%, and lead gen, which is the Lead Accelerator product that I just spoke about. And the fact that we haven't really focused it on mobile, with the shift to mobile as well from a user experience perspective. So I think some of it is a shift into the advertisers and some of it is just I think a legacy that we've kind of over-performed in for a while. And the last couple of quarters, the transition hit us a little harder.
Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, Steve.
Operator
And your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you guys could just clarify a little bit on the guidance for the rest of the year. It looks like the back half core business ex-lynda is coming down. So if my math is right, you beat by $37 million. It looks like your back half lynda revenue now would be about $35 million higher, so that's $72 million. But you guided up $40 million for the year. Can you just help clarify that?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, lynda first, so lynda we earlier guided to about $40 million. We're now projecting $90 million. That's a combination of an earlier close than we anticipated â seemed to really do a good job pulling in the close; the deferred write-down being less than anticipated; and to a lesser extent upticking the number for the enterprise portion of lynda in the back half of the year.
In terms of the core business, the Marketing Solutions is where the visibility is more limited, I just talked about the display deteriorating, and are more focused on content and lead generation. So that's where the guidance is reflected most from in terms of a slight takedown for the back half of the year.
In terms of Talent Solutions, we've actually seen firming relative to last quarter. As you recall, we went through the re-segmentation process to better align our customer reps against the customers by a more granular segmentation. And that firmed throughout the quarter. We had very strong metrics across the board within Talent Solutions. So those are kind of gives and takes. Marketing Solutions on the display side is the area where we're continuing to have limited visibility.
Operator
And your next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Sachin Khattar - Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. This is Sachin sitting in for Brian. So couple of questions. The first is, Steve, on your comments, can you elaborate a little bit on what you said about Premium Subscriptions should become smaller as a percentage of revenue over time. I know in the past, you guys had talked about the opportunity for sales people, for any organization there's more of them than there are HR people, so that that could be a potentially big opportunity. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. What I'm referring there to, over time, the Premium Subscriptions line for us has really been more of a channel as opposed to kind of a market like Talent Solutions or Marketing Solutions or Sales Solutions. And as we, for example, have been revamping the Premium Subscription platform, there's been a shift in some of the historical premium revenues to other categories. So, for example, Job Seeker Subscriptions used to be within the premium category, now it's up in Talent Solutions. Similar with Recruiter Lite, which is a subscription product. It's now hitting Talent Solutions. And ultimately Sales Solutions, which is now reported in Premium Subscriptions, we plan to report as a separate segment. And so that will come out of Premium Subscriptions. And we kind of utilize Premium Subscriptions in a way as an incubator. We talked about it in the prepared remarks where it's what launched Recruiter; it's what's launching Sales Navigator. We have new products that we're planning to roll out within Premium, but over time, we believe that they'll fall into these other business lines. And so that's what I meant by it.
Sachin Khattar - Jefferies LLC
Okay. All right. And then, real quickly. What countries is lynda active in currently? And I think you guys said it's available in five languages, what are your sort of plans for taking that â bringing that out sort of more broadly over other languages?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So it's available in all countries where we operate, the five languages: English, German, Italian, French, Japanese. And one of the things we are most excited about is expanding the global footprint for lynda. So we think it's a good fit in all of our major markets on a global basis and we're looking forward to being able to drive that expansion as soon as the integration is further down the road.
Sachin Khattar - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey, guys. Afternoon. Jeff, maybe could you comment a little bit on â you mentioned in the script that you're seeing some improvement in the net promoter scores for Sales Navigator. Are there certain things that you would point to specifically there that has improved as the product's rolled out for its more formal launch over the last 12 months?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think some of that is, it's a newer product and it's a very different dynamic in terms of how to approach identifying prospects, engaging with those prospects, closing those prospects. So, some of that is probably attributable to people learning how to use the product better. Some of it is also very explicitly tied to our team paying very close attention to feedback we're getting from customers. So making it easier to use, making it clear that Sales Navigator is a standalone client experience relative to our core flagship product, and there's still plenty of work to be done on that front.
We've also increasingly invested in our social selling index and making that a more prominent feature and that's something that's been very well received, where sales people can gauge how much value they're getting from the product and how they're better leveraging a social selling dynamic. So that's all to date, and we've got a very comprehensive roadmap that we're going to continue to execute on going forward.
Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney. Your line is now open.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Two questions, please. The 32% growth in the Hiring Solutions or in Hiring revenue in the quarter, how should we interpret that? That's a deceleration from the prior quarter. Is it that you still haven't fully recovered some of the productivity levels that you had prior to kind of the sales force changes in the March quarter?
And then secondly, I'm sorry you keep breaking up on the call. Steve, when you were answering Doug's question about the reduction in the core organic guidance, did you say that that was all due to Marketing Solutions and display advertising, if you could just state that again, please?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Marketing Solutions is the area with the limited visibility that we've adjusted guidance for on the display side. In terms of the growth within Talent Solutions, so when we talk about the metrics all firming, which they had in the quarter â net ratio up year-on-year, churn down sequentially and annually, ARPU near record levels, and a good healthy number of new customers â those have a lagging impact due to the ratable nature of the revenue recognition. So the 32% decel isn't yet fully impacted by the activity of this quarter. I would also highlight that on a constant currency basis that that would be 36% within the core Hiring Solutions product this quarter.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
One thing I would also add to that, a number of questions on the deceleration in display. And as Steve alluded to earlier, that's something we've been preparing for for some time. We actually thought it was going to impact us more materially last year than it did. So we exceeded our own expectations. That's one of the reasons we've invested so aggressively in our native advertising solution. And with regard to Sponsored Updates, that's exceeded our expectations; that continues to exceed our expectations, now approaching roughly half of our Marketing Solutions business and increasingly becoming the core of our offering. And there is a lot of focus on Talent Solutions as a core business for LinkedIn, but it's Sponsored Updates that's become the fastest growing business in our history.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Robert Peck with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Just to clarify, sort of to Doug's question as well on the EBITDA side of things. It looked to us like you beat by about $43 million, but you only increased the guide by about $35 million, taking down the profitability by about $8 million for the second half of the year. We know in the press release you talk about a 3% impact from lynda, which would be about a $90 million hit. What's the incremental change there, now that you've closed it earlier. We're just trying to gauge what the core profitability is doing?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So this is the first full quarter of lynda, so we are absorbing the complete expense base within that number. In addition, we still have a portion of the deferred write-down that acts kind of as a reduction to margin and some one-time cost in the quarter; that's part of that as well. So those are the main differences between the lynda margin and the kind of â what the core margin would be for the quarter.
Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Is there, though, an incremental hit, therefore can you quantify what the incremental hit is from lynda on EBITDA, so we can just back into what the core EBITDA is doing?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So the incremental hit from lynda is about somewhere in the low $20 million range.
Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. So that would therefore imply that the core profitability is therefore doing better?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes.
Robert S. Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

And your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Justin, if you're speaking, we can't hear your question. You may be on mute.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Can you hear me now?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, perfect. We're doing a Verizon commercial all of a sudden.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah, thanks. So the two questions, probably best for Steve. When do you think you work through the display headwinds? And if you look out, is it 2016 or 2017 when you really don't have such a large revenue balance that you'll see the true growth rate of the Sponsored Updates? And then the second thing is just accounting thing. How much, if you have it in front of you, deferred revenue did lynda add in the second quarter to the balance sheet? Thank you.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So for the display question, it's all a relative within Marketing Solutions, the growth rates of each of these areas between native content, lead gen and legacy display. This quarter, our display business was probably around 17% of the overall Marketing Solutions, that was down from probably around 20% last quarter. If we had to project, I'd expect it to be closer to lower-teens exiting the year. And so that's kind of the trajectory we believe we're seeing. And that's kind of the rough level of revenue contribution that it's currently contributing, again, comping against a year last year where display held up much more firmly.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And then lynda contribution to just your long or short-term deferred revenue on the balance sheet?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So lynda contributed about $50 million of deferred, about 80% of that this year and about 20% beyond.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. So $40 million to short-term deferred. Thank you.

Your next question comes from James Lee with CLSA. Your line is now open.
James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, Steve, the pricing decline in premium display, was it due to any kind of sales process change you may have made from last year to this year meaning on the media platform to stop bringing in-house sales to outside problematic and therefore causing that pricing decline. And also on China specifically, can you guys talk about the functionality for the newly designed Chinese app, what do you think is resolving the frictions in the Chinese professional and networking space? Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. On the display side, I would say no kind of fundamental significant changes in terms of the go-to-market. I would say that, as we talked about in the prior couple of quarters, that we rolled out lead gen our LLA product pretty broadly beginning in the first quarter and a retraining of the entire sales force focusing on the go-to-market there. And so, obviously, when you're in a transition like that, that does impact focus amongst other areas of the business. So I would say when you're talking about sales changes, it's probably more of a focus thing than anything as opposed to a particular change.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
With regard to China, I would point to two material differences. One is it's mobile-only, Chitu is a mobile-only product, and that is very much by design. And that's something we were hearing from our membership in China. And so the team is taking full advantage of that. So the signup process, onboarding process, process through which people are building out their networks and inviting others, that's all happening via mobile. Also, there is a good emphasis on groups in the Chinese market and, as a result, we're seeing some healthy levels of engagement, conversation, discussions, and that's something we want to see on a global basis, not just in China. So we're certainly going to pay attention to those trends and continue to learn from that launch.
And it's not just the standalone app that's having success in the Chinese market, our growth in absolute terms has accelerated fairly materially such that in absolute terms, again, in terms of new signups on a daily basis, China is second only to the United States on a global basis. So gaining good traction in China, a lot of work still to do, but we're pleased with the results so far.
James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC
And, Jeff, is there any reason you're keeping an invitation-only basis at this point in time? Are there any new functionality that you plan to introduce before you open up to GA?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's an early-stage beta. I think the team was able to move very quickly on this. It's essentially a startup within our company. That's the way the team was organized and that's been their focus, and they want to learn and get feedback from the earliest customers and member experiences being generated, and then refine the product as they go up. But for the most part to your point, the core value proposition is fairly well-established.
James Lee - CLSA Americas LLC

Your next question comes from Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, thanks. Two questions. First, on the marketing services side, when you think about Sponsored Updates and native advertising, how do you sort of view your offering from a product standpoint targetability relative to, I guess, others who provide similar type of ad formats right now in the market? Are you kind of at parity? Are you still a couple of years behind in terms of what you can offer?
And, I guess, the second would be just on the Talent side, you guys talked about sort of firming up as you sort of cycle through the sales force transition. Any way to sort of think about how much of that is just sales you're getting from another account, so it's firming up versus kind of how you've now segmented that sales force and whether or not that segmentation has actually been additive and will continue to be additive to growth in the future? Thanks.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So with regard to Sponsored Updates targeting capabilities, we have pretty granular targeting capabilities across most of our Marketing Solutions platform. And I should add, we're in the process right now of completely overhauling our core Marketing Solutions experience for customers. And we're getting some good positive feedback on that. That's literally rolling out as we speak, so over the next few weeks, that will be completed. Once that's in place, as a foundation, we're going to be able to accelerate the pace with which we're able to make improvement. So based on the data that we have, based on our historical targeting capability, I think we're in a good place there. So we're going to continue to innovate and iterate on this foundation that we're executing on and currently rolling out on. Steve, do you want to take the next one?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay, sure. Well, what I was going to say on the Talent Solutions side with regard to the re-segmentation, we talked about operational firming and execution and across the board, the metrics being stronger this quarter. Also I think one thing to highlight, getting through that transition, where we're much better aligned with the customers, this is in front of I think a product innovation cycle that we haven't had in a couple of years within that Hiring Solutions space. So I think it not only positions us well for kind of the core Recruiter solutions, our four core products today, but some of the newer products that we have coming out down the pike.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And segmentation aside, I think one of the things coming out of the first quarter that we have been most pleased with is the way the team kind of rolled up their sleeves and dug in to understanding how we're creating value on a per-customer basis literally that granularly. And the team has built some really interesting tools that enable us to understand value created, where there are gaps, and what we can do to close those gaps. And that now exists on a global basis, and it's going to be extensible into our other business lines.
And to add to Steve's point about setting the stage for innovation later this year, with regard to our flagship Recruiter product, we've got some new product development, that's really going to take that product to the next level, in terms of simplifying the search experience, in terms of referrals, which has been much in demand now for years, people looking for a better and more scalable and extensible way of doing referrals within their organizations, and identifying the right candidates. So a more relevant experience for our Recruiter customers.
Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, guys.

And your next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. Jeff, I was wondering if you can give us a sense of what your product priorities are from here. Particularly anything that you believe you can do to drive engagement with all of the content that you've got on the platform now?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So we have a really comprehensive roadmap in place and our product pipeline is as strong as I've seen it certainly in the last six years to seven years. With regard to our mobile flagship offering, every 18 months to 24 months, we've been in a position where we've refreshed and re-imagined that offering and we're in that cycle right now. We're going to be focusing on five core pillars: the Feed, Profile, Messenger, My Network and Search, and we're excited about the direction across all five of those pillars and, as a result, what that will mean for the next generation of our flagship experience.
We are continuing to work on lynda integration, it's still early days, but we have been very pleased with the results we've seen thus far. That's not only lynda integration in SlideShare, but going forward, it's a natural for our Job Seeker subscription package. We think there is some really interesting things we can do on that front with regard to people hitting our jobs pages, understanding what skills they have, what skills they need, and enabling them to close that gap by virtue of taking a lynda course. We just completely overhauled our Pulse application basically from an RSS reader to an experienced that understands who you are, who you're connected to, and it's leveraging machine learning social cues and curation to deliver what we believe to be one of the most relevant, most valuable professional news experiences on the web today.
Our Job Seeker application and our career value prop is something that historically we haven't been as focused on. That's become one of our top priorities. We've see an increase of roughly 2 million activations, we're 1 million activations for that application just a couple of months ago. We exceeded 3 million recently. Our engagement in our Job Seeker experience from a unique user perspective and page view perspective is accelerating, and this is just with very early stage improvements in that product. That's also a very exciting roadmap, so we've got a lot coming on that front. So those are a few examples of the member experience improvements that we're going to be making over the next several months and quarters to come.
Heath P. Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Your next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open.
Mark May - Citi Investment Research
Thank you. First one on uniques, I think they were flat sequentially in the quarter. I don't think we've seen that in a while, maybe before. Just wondering, is that just because you're seeing maybe a steeper decel in your desktop UDs that are not maybe being offset by mobile. And if so, I was just wondering, how you're thinking about that particular metric going forward?
And then in Talent Solutions, I'm making the assumption that your corporate solutions metric does not include lynda customers. But assuming that that's correct, it looks like that your ARPU was down, it was maybe negative 1% year-on-year, and I don't think that we've seen that in a while. Is that kind of the follow-through from some of the issues that you talked about in Q1 and how should we be thinking about Talent Solutions ARPU going forward? Thanks.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So with regard to the sequential growth rate, the summer months are usually a seasonally slower period for us, so we are more focused on year-over-year growth. To your point, though, when compared to previous years, there is that shift from desktop to mobile. We've now become primarily a mobile engagement service, we're north of 50% on that front, and we do see higher levels of engagement once people have transitioned over. So desktop is growing slower, mobile is growing substantially faster.
Some of that growth is not necessarily tied to a better member experience. So one of the things we alluded to on the script earlier is the fact that we're sending less emails out and we want to make sure that when we're touching our end user, when we're touching the member experience that we're creating value, and that's all about delivering on value propositions. So we've been able to remove four of every 10 emails that we've been sending to members, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We've seen a reduction in member complaints by over 50%. And while there may be some marginal hit to unique user growth as a result of sending fewer emails out in the immediate term, we think that's going to pay meaningful dividends longer term.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And I'll just add on top of that. I think one of the key metrics that we've seen over the last couple of quarters is page views per unique visitor accelerating nicely at record highs, and that's kind of a sign of the people coming back being more active. So the quality level and the relevance level improving, I think that's an important metric.
On your question in terms of the Talent Solutions or the Hiring Solutions customers, yeah, that does not include lynda customers in that Talent â it's apples-to-apples â about 2,700, new customers up to 37,000. The ARPU is, yeah, roughly flat, down slightly from a year ago, actually a little bit up from Q1 last quarter. And I think the way to think about the ARPU, this is kind of a volume rate aspect to the business where we are expanding the customer base pretty rapidly. Many of those customers are SMB. As a matter of fact, they weight more towards the SMB. And so the ability to actually keep the ARPU at these near record levels is actually a positive at the same time that we're expanding the base. So we actually â it's one of these things where there's going to be that tension between expansion and kind of deepening within accounts and we for the most part had success in doing both.
Mark May - Citi Investment Research

Your next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With regards to Talent Solutions, just a follow-on on that, on the ARPU question. So, if the ARPU is going to stay around the current level or drift down slightly, should we expect that the number of new clients that sign up is going to increase at a faster rate or how should we think about that? Because you mentioned that the re-segmentation affects end up lagging and it sounded like you were implying there should be an acceleration in Hiring Solutions, ex-lynda?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. I think the ARPU is just â it's difficult to predict I think over the shorter term â because of the tension of the breadth of volume increasing against selling deeper into account. I think longer term, given the value proposition that we have, we've talked about a lever of price increasing that we instituted in January. We've seen only positive results from that price increase. So there's all these levers that come into play. It's a matter of just which one is going up faster at a particular point in time. I think as you look over a longer period of time, I think there is more room for ARPU to continue to increase. But I think here in the shorter period from quarter-to-quarter, the fact that we've been expanding so rapidly and deepening the relationships, I think has been a good sign overall.
Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. And then, can you just mention â Talent Solutions and Lynda â can you talk a little bit about the enterprise reaction? You mentioned that in the release. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate; it sounds like you're getting good traction there?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that's continued momentum. Enterprise has been growing faster than consumer for lynda prior to the acquisition. That trend has continued. We're in market right now doing validations in terms of how we can create even more value. And we've also been giving a lot of thought to the way in which we're going to go-to-market, how we're going leverage our Talent Solutions sales force, the extent to which it remains independent, which segments and cohorts we want to target and focus on. So a lot of good work happening there and hopefully by the end of this year, we'll be in a position where we'll be prepared to go to market in integrated fashion. But for the remainder of this year, it's going to be largely standalone.

And your last question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one on the Talent Solutions, just going back to the firming in the Talent Solutions that you talked about, you didn't talk about any industries or regions that you're seeing incremental strength in. And when you look across where you're penetrated and underpenetrated by industry, where do you still see the most runway if you look at some of the industry breakdown of your customers? And then on lynda, how should we think about your estimate on B2C versus B2B lynda revenue in the back half and for the full year guidance? Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So in terms of the firming aspect, yeah, so it's been pretty broad-based on a global basis. I would say, last quarter, we had, I would say, a little hiccup within Europe. I'd say, Europe is still relatively weaker, but an improvement from last quarter. So on a regional basis, we saw pretty widespread improvement relative to last quarter in terms of the key metrics that we look at, net ratio churn, et cetera.
In terms of the industries and regions, the big one is still our technology, financial, health services. We've pretty much broadened the reach pretty widespread with Recruiter product. So we're touching a lot of different industries. But there is a lot more opportunity to go deeper within each of those, including some of the larger ones that we're currently in.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then on lynda?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, the lynda piece, today the consumer piece is the larger piece of the business. We expect, over time, the mix to shift as we take the opportunity to our â the hope is our 37,000 corporate clients. But today, it's roughly two-thirds/one-third.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. That's going to do it. Thank you so much for your time. And we'll talk to you again next quarter. Take care.
