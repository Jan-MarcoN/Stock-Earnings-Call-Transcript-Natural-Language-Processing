Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 4 2014 Covidien plc Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kathy, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Cole Lannum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Coleman N. Lannum
Thank you very much, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Joe Almeida, Covidien's Chairman, President and CEO; and Chuck Dockendorff, our Chief Financial Officer.
We'll be making some brief introductory comments as usual, and then spend most of the time this morning answering your questions.
Today's call will focus on our fourth quarter results. We will not be providing any 2015 guidance due to the expected timing of the close of our acquisition by Medtronic.
During today's call, we may make some forward-looking statements, and it's possible that actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please, refer to the cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including Form 10-K, for additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.
We may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance today. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our press release and its related financial tables, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, covidien.com.
For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13. After adjusting for certain specified items, our non-GAAP earnings came in at $1.15 per share. The after-tax impact of amortization in the quarter was $0.10 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe, who'll go into more detail on the fourth quarter results. Joe?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Thank you, Coleman. We had an outstanding fourth quarter, bolstering results that exceeded our expectations. Sales were up 7%, both operationally and as reported, and up 8% in the Medical Devices segment.
We were very pleased with our performance in developed markets, particularly in the United States, where we achieved 6% sales growth, and in Australia, where we registered double-digit sales gain. In addition, as expected, the sales growth rate in Japan improved from the prior quarter. In emerging markets, we once again posted double-digit operational sales growth, reflecting the investments we have made over the past few years. This performance reflected strength in the BRIC countries, particularly Russia. We plan to continue to invest in these countries as we still believe they offer good opportunities for growth.
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter performance in individual product sales categories. As usual, I will discuss our growth on an operational basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
Within Surgical Solutions, Advanced Surgical sales were up 18%, aided by sales growth in the mid-teens for vessel sealing. This represents the 36th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains for vessel sealing.
New product launches, including LigaSure Impact and blunt tip continued to contribute to our market share gain in this category. We also continued to gain market share in our stapling franchise, particularly in endomechanical stapling. Our significant growth this quarter was driven by demand for Tri-Staple reloads as we continue to benefit from procedures, shifting from open to minimally invasive surgery. Our results were also aided by the launch of Reinforced Reload earlier this year, which integrates a proprietary buttress material with Tri-Staple.
We were also very pleased with our results in the hernia category. We once again posted double-digit increase in synthetic mesh, which was aided by the launch of our Symbotex Composite Mesh earlier this year. We continue to make targeted investments in this space to bolster our portfolio. Most recently, we launched our ReliaTack fixation device.
Turning to GI. BÃRRX continued to grow very well, this quarter, bolstering growth in the mid-teens.
In addition, Given Imaging delivered results that exceeded our expectations. Finally, interventional lung delivered the best quarter results yet, registering growth in excess of 50%. Both of these strategic bets are paying off.
Within General Surgical, we've benefited from the acquisitions of New Wave and WEM in Brazil. However, the continued impact of our current year divestiture of Confluent biosurgery and a modest decrease in sales of surgical instruments resulted in General Surgical sales that were about level with the prior year.
Moving to Vascular Therapies. Neurovascular sales were 7% above those of the prior year, while our Peripheral Vascular recorded modest growth during the quarter.
In Neurovascular, we saw significant sales gains in both Solitaire and Access delivery products. During the quarter, we re-entered the market with our Pipeline Embolization in Alligator Retrieval Devices. The timely resolution of the recall of these products served to minimize the impact on our results. In addition, the Pipeline Flex launched in Europe last quarter continued to perform well.
While we are glad Neurovascular is back on track and has returned to market growth rates, we believe our strong and new product pipeline will drive further growth going forward.
Within Peripheral Vascular, increased sales of chronic venous insufficiency and procedural support products were partially offset by decreased sales of compression products in the U.S.
Turning to Respiratory and Patient Care. Patient Monitoring sales were once again 6% above those of 1 year ago. This strong performance was led by capnography growth, which well exceeded 20% yet again.
In Airway & Ventilation, we had a sizable increase in sales of mid-tier ventilators. In addition, we continued to see positive results from the launch of the PB980 earlier this year. To date, sales of this new product have exceeded our initial projections.
Within Nursing Care, sales grew moderately during the quarter, driven by weaker enteral feeding and incontinence products.
Finally, Patient Care growth was driven by higher sales of electrodes and OEM products.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Sapheon and Reverse Medical, both of which complement our vascular portfolio. And we expanded our Sonicision device portfolio. In addition, we opened an innovation and training center in Brazil, which represents our first in Latin America and our fifth in emerging markets.
All of these actions were aligned with our key strategic initiatives, which include executing on an emerging markets growth strategy and customer-focused portfolio investment initiatives. Our growth continues to be derived from our investments in strategic bets, in addition to contributing to our outstanding performance for both the quarter and the year. These investments have positioned our businesses rather well for continued growth.
I will now pass the call over to Chuck, who will discuss the fourth quarter financials in more detail. Chuck?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Thanks, Joe. As Joe mentioned, we were very pleased with the financial results in the quarter. Sales came in above plan, and we once again have improved financial metrics on all components of the P&L and improved foreign exchange impact over the prior year. We were also able to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 26% for the quarter and 12% for the year.
As noted in the release, we registered a 260 basis point increase in adjusted gross margin this quarter. This was largely a result of our ongoing manufacturing cost reduction programs and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange.
In addition, volume mix increased gross margin by over 100 basis points, which more than offset our normal price impact.
We continue to benefit from productivity improvements and drive operational leverage, most notably in emerging markets. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales declined 130 basis points despite upward pressure from acquisitions and some continued investments in emerging markets.
We also continue to make incremental investments in research and development this quarter. While R&D expense was about even with the prior year on a reported basis, adjusted R&D, excluding a prior year license agreement charge, was up 16%. As a percent of sales, R&D was 5.4% this quarter, which represents our highest quarterly spend on R&D to date. On an adjusted basis -- and it demonstrates our continued commitment to investing in future growth.
On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter operating margin was 24.3% of sales. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 70 basis points and above our expectations. All other factors held constant, the movement in currency exchange rates that positively impacted our fourth quarter results will likely have a negative impact on earnings going forward.
Net interest expense increased 5% this quarter. This was due to a onetime benefit to interest income in the prior year quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact in the interest rate swaps that we entered into this year.
The adjusted tax rate for both the quarter and the year came in lower than expected due in part to a more favorable geographic mix of income.
We achieved significant EPS growth this quarter despite not buying back any shares. As we previously had indicated, we did not buy back any shares due to restrictions in the Medtronic transaction agreement and under the Irish Takeover Rules. In addition, we do not anticipate making any further purchases under our share repurchase program.
We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter performance and strong fiscal 2014 results, improving both adjusted gross and operating margins, driving leverage on SG&A and increasing our investment in research and development while achieving double-digit earnings growth. At the same time, we continue to make investments to drive future growth.
As Cole mentioned, we will not be providing 2015 guidance. However, we would like to point out that we do not expect the overall fundamentals underlying our business to change. While the benefit we got this quarter from foreign exchange will likely put downward pressure on our gross margin next year, we plan to continue to execute on our manufacturing cost reduction programs and drive operational leverage. In addition, we remain committed to offsetting the impact of acquisitions through SG&A cost reductions. We also intend to continue to invest in research and development to drive future growth. We feel very good about our future prospects given our expanding product portfolio, robust new product pipeline, geographic diversity and strong cash flow.
I'll now turn the call back to Coleman for Q&A.
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks a lot, Chuck. [Operator Instructions] We will be ending the call promptly before 9:30 to end this call before trading starts, so please be considerate of others on the call when asking your brief questions. In addition, we understand there may be some questions around the pending transaction with Medtronic. However, we'd like to remind you that those questions are best answered by Medtronic, and we'll only be able to speak to matters that are specifically Covidien related. We'll do our best to answer your questions, but understand that we may have to defer to Medtronic.
Kathy, could you one more time please repeat the process for signaling a question and then go directly to our first caller in the queue?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of BoA.
Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So the -- just a question for Joe and then a question for Chuck. Joe, if you have any broad comments on how the integration plan is going with Medtronic, we'd love to hear them. But absent that, I'd love to get a quick comment from you just on geographic growth this quarter. In emerging markets, maybe any color on why things seemed to have accelerated. And in the U.S., can you comment on U.S. surgical volumes? And then for Chuck, just to get everything out of the way here, on the currency question, yes, I mean, going back years ago -- I know it's very hard to give rough rules of thumb about flow-through. But years ago, you had commented about a 35% flow-through on revenue dollars. We're just wondering if there's any kind of updated way you might help us think about currency flow-through as you look forward.
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Listen, the integration is going well. Medtronic is doing a great job bringing the teams together. We have good people leading on both sides, and its -- the organizational designs are going forward. So from our perspective, things are going extremely well, which is not only to make sure that we support whatever needs to be supported and Medtronic needs to make this transition very smoothly and for day 1 for this acquisition for Medtronic to be very successful. There's significant amount of teams involved. There's significant amount of people. This has been a great effort, and I'm not surprised how companies are working well together because one of the premises of our conversations early on between Omar and me were related to how these 2 companies are poised and have the culture to work well together. So we're very happy with how things are going. On the broad commentary regarding performance, I would say -- let me take up -- because your questions is interrelated between the volumes in the U.S. and perhaps in Europe and the overall global volumes. So I would say that we continue to be very successful in emerging markets. There are headwinds in parts of emerging markets, and we think those -- we've seen those headwinds in the past, and we find that you've got to continue on with your investments; otherwise, you will have this seesaw going up and down of investments and lack of investments, investments. So one of the successes that we have scored in the last few years in emerging markets was our ability to be very steady in how we vest and were very pragmatic about where to invest. And I have to say that this was not used often. I believe that going forward, this will be the focus of both companies. I will tell you that we have -- we compile internally 2 or 3 indexes that we gauge volume across the globe. Now like all of you have your resources of how volumes are going, I would say the U.S. volume has stabilized and has modestly improved. And I will say that Europe, we don't see much difference between previous quarters and this quarter. We had a very good growth in Europe operationally, 4.3%. Some of it is market share growth. In the U.S., we see the market a bit more stable. As I said, we're cautiously optimistic. You need to have 4 quarters of this kind of behavior of the market to be able to draw a conclusion. Remember, fourth quarter calendar year, meaning October, November, December, for the health care, or at least medtech businesses, is usually a stronger quarter for a lot of people because it's how the insurance and deductibles are played in the U.S. I think there's more stabilization of unemployment in the U.S., and you saw this morning there's more job creation that was planned. So when those things are working well, they all work in favor of health care in general. So I would say be attentive to more than just one quarter of good results. In general for the U.S. It will [ph] be more attentive for a trend in the next 2 or 3 quarters.
Charles J. Dockendorff
Bob, this is Chuck. Just following up on the foreign exchange question. And I know that's a big question out there, and without us giving guidance, it makes it more difficult to see what the impact is. Clearly, I think, as everybody knows, over the last couple of months, 3 to 4 months, the dollar has strengthened quite a bit, and this certainly will have an impact on the year-on-year compares as we get into fiscal year '15. I would just like to say that when we look back at '14, we started out the year in the same kind of situation where we really had some large negative foreign exchange compares in the first and second quarter, and then we saw that turning for the Q3 and Q4 balance of it, of which we, at that point, said we think now we can return to double-digit growth, which we have in fiscal year '14. You saw the 12% growth despite, overall for the full year, foreign exchange was still negative, slightly lower, 1%. So despite the foreign exchange being negative in '14 and the fact that we really didn't have much financial leverage and that we stopped buying back shares, we're still able to grow the business 12%, and this is while increasing R&D. So our underlying fundamentals in the business, and this is what we try to say in the script, we feel very, very good about. The underlying business will continue to grow in a double-digit pace of that mid-single-digit sales growth rate, and we'll continue to invest and do acquisitions and those kind of things. As a rule of thumb, I mean, I think it's -- the way to think about it is more than half our operating income is outside the U.S. and at very profitable rates. And it is this mix that you have to be concerned about because you just can't look at the dollar index, but there is a mix of income with Japan and other countries in Europe, the euro and the pound. And with that significant thing, it's really the translation aspect of that, of our profits, that has the biggest impact. But clearly, I think the dollar index is up over -- 4% to 5% over the last couple of months and maybe even 7%. So that will have -- right now as it stands, if that continues, it will have a pretty good impact on our fiscal year '15 reported performance.

The next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And I was just wondering, Joe, if you could maybe provide some perspective overall just on the management and board's view of the Medtronic deal given all things that have been kind of talked about from a treasury perspective as you guys will certainly still be shareholders of Medtronic following the close. Anything -- any thoughts, I guess, there?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Unfortunately, Cole just cut you to one question. I'll tell you that we are very -- from the very beginning, we spoke about the nature of this deal, which is purely strategic. The tax loopholes and how the tax inversion works here is more of a consequence of where Covidien sits as a company than anything else. We didn't speak about tax inversions between Omar and me until further into the process, okay? This had to make sense from the point of view of 2 very large companies that now can service in the hospital all the way to the home in a very effective manner and 2 companies with large G&As that can really work hard and get the G&A down and look at synergies in cost to be able to fund even more innovation and rewarding the shareholders of both companies. So our board feels comfortable with where we are today. And I cannot speak from the shareholders' perspective, but from my perspective, I'll say that this is a great investment for me personally, it's keeping the shares up at the closing because I think this is going to be a wonderful company and probably the most successful medtech company out there. So -- but don't take my comments as an incentive to approve the deal one way or the other. I'm just telling you this because it is a legal requirement that we have from the Irish high court to make sure that when speak in public, we'll not swing our shareholders one way or the other. But my personal opinion on this is that this is a great investment for me personally going forward because it -- now under Omar, this is going to be a great company.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Maybe just one integrated question on cost and sort of for Joe and for Chuck. Joe, there was this view heading into this transaction that Covidien had reached the point where you could grow top-tier organic growth, but you couldn't deliver bottom line earnings. Or you could deliver maybe 3% to 5% organic growth, but you could deliver double-digit earnings. Maybe you should talk to your confidence that this company, Covidien, could drive top-tier organic growth and double-digit earnings growth. And related to that, Chuck, heading into this deal, I wonder if you can just give us an update on where we stand on the cost restructuring initiatives you talked about last year. Where are we either on a relative or absolute basis in terms of getting through them prior to the deal close?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
I'll say that the major driver for any company to achieve the organic growth above market is to do a relentless process and portfolio management. And if you look at our results today, I would say a large part of our growth are coming from the strategic initiatives that in 2013, meaning last year, we were -- spoke to you at Investor Day in September. So that shows the effectiveness of our strategy in driving the company's top line growth. The bottom line growth, we will achieve double-digit growth. You can achieve that every year. There's things beyond your control like FX and other things. But in the main, Covidien aims to double-digit growth in the bottom line, and we start achieving that despite the fact we had very tough comps in the beginning of the year. We are achieving and we would be achieving double-digit growth operationally in the bottom line due to our relentless effort in optimizing cost. And that is G&A, also sales coverage and cost to manufacture or cost of production. So those things will fill 2 different things. One is, we'll fill the innovation back into the company, which then turns into the ability to buy companies in early stages like we just bought this past quarter; but also to return money to our shareholders in 2 different ways. One is in earnings growth. The other way is the ability to buy shares back and continue to increase dividends. So all in all, it's all connected. But the ability to perform a relentless and dispassionate [ph] portfolio management, the top line, is what gives me confidence that Covidien as is has the ability to continue to grow the top line above market and will, in the mid to long term, deliver more quarters with double-digit growth on earnings than last quarters.
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, David, just on the cost-reduction program that we started, this is relatively significant, and it was really the basis, and I think Joe mentioned it, where we could continue to drive as a separate organization to double-digit EPS growth. So we knew we would have to leverage SG&A and, of course, also drive out manufacturing costs. I think Medtronic announced in their acquisition that they see $850 million or $840 million of synergies.
Coleman N. Lannum
$850 million-plus.
Charles J. Dockendorff
$850 million-plus of synergies. And as part of that, we wanted to make sure the integration team is looking at both the reductions that we had planned as well as the additional integration savings. So this is all combined together, and we're all going after this. The plans are in place. You can see the leverage that we got this year on our SG&A and some of our manufacturing cost reduction, which helped us drive to double-digit growth this year. We had more of that planned. We're -- we probably paused a little bit here in the integration planning, but they are committed to capture all of that, both our stand-alone reductions as well as the combined entities' cost savings together.
Operator
The next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Let me just ask a couple of fundamental questions. If you could touch on the health of the hernia repair business, and I'm speaking about the mesh, which sounds very strong, and the fixation business, and how we should view that market going forward. And then second, the performance in the interventional lung space, what secretly appears to be accelerating, and I just want to get your view on where that business is, if you think you're at an inflection point with the development of that market.
JosÃ© E. Almeida
I'll talk about the -- a little bit about both items. I don't want to take a long time because they are all -- they're major drivers that Covidien currently execute in our portfolio. They're doing extremely well. The focus on the [indiscernible] in hernia we spoke about 18 months ago our renewed effort in going after new products and going out to market. Covidien is now #1, maybe #2, and our aim is to be #1 in that market. So with the launch of Symbotex, the composite mesh, plus 5 launches that we experienced in the last 18 months, plus on the fixation, the ReliaTack articulating device, we now have a portfolio second to none. We're going to go after this market with a tremendous amount of energy. And the double-digit just show how well we're executing. And the folks, led by Steve Blazejewski and our global team, are doing a superb job here. When it comes to the lung, we're just executing on our strategy. Our strategy is to make sure we can get those navigation consoles everywhere possible, and then go after the therapy, which is -- will be percutaneous in the beginning, and hopefully, eventually, it's going to go endobronchial. But then as the plan, -- oh, it was the plan all along. So Chuck Brynelsen who's managing this in Minneapolis, is doing a superb job getting this business on a very strong footing. I was in China. Our R&D team in China is developing some software for procedure management as well alongside the software that was just implemented for the console itself, developed in Minneapolis. So we're very happy across both spectrums. So I'd go -- going back to the question that I answered before, it's all about portfolio management and making sure that we're deploying cash and capital to the businesses that have the highest potential for growth and for profitability.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Can I ask a follow-up, Cole? Is that all right?
Coleman N. Lannum
Michael, go ahead.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So I just want to ask on the deal itself just to see where we are on the timetable for both the final proxy and shareholder vote just to think about closing.
Coleman N. Lannum
So Mike, I mean, the key is -- the next step is to get an effective S-4. We're continuing along the process along with Medtronic and discussing that with the SEC. And I don't have a timetable at this time other than to say that we are making progress, and we hope to have it soon. Once we get the effective S-4, then we can establish with the Irish High Court the shareholder vote dates, and then we can move forward there, along with our timetable that we updated last week with our joint 8-K with Medtronic. But the key right now, at least from an approval standpoint, is really to get that S-4 deemed effective as soon as possible. Separately, we continue along the path of antitrust clearance. But discussions on antitrust really need to come from our partners at Medtronic. We don't want to make any comments at this time.
Operator
The next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays.
Xuyang Li - Barclays Capital, Research Division
This is actually Young Li in for Matt Taylor. So, I mean, I understand that you're not providing guidance. But can you talk a little bit more about -- maybe qualitatively about the Peripheral Vascular business going forward? How do you think DEFINITIVE AR could change practice patterns around the use of atherectomy and DCB? Can you maybe talk about the market the opportunity there? And do you need to perform additional studies to increase the level of evidence?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Listen, we are very excited about some of the studies there coming out. DEFINITIVE AR is a great one. It's a great proof of the combination of directional and mechanical atherectomy with the -- which I've called [ph] below. I think if you look at our Peripheral Vascular portfolio, it was a very complete portfolio. 24 months ago, we started engaging and catering differently to physician-owned lab. You're starting to see the results right now. It's a real tough market. If you look at our competitors' growth, our growth stands out in terms of Peripheral Vascular. Now the overall vascular number has the compression numbers, which were a little soft this quarter. But if you remove that, the Peripheral -- endovascular numbers are good. And I would say that going forward, we're going to continue to invest in the clinical studies for effectiveness. And also in some areas will be economic studies as well. I think under the new company, this is going to be a powerhouse in Peripheral Vascular, primarily when you look at third quarter balloon that is coming up on the Medtronic side, plus all the accessories in everything -- every single thing that we have in Peripheral Vascular. So this is going to be a phenomenal franchise for the new company, and I don't think there's any reason to not to continue to invest heavily in the clinical and economic studies for both of them.
Operator
It comes from Rick Wise of Stifel.
Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
And just -- I'll just ask in 1 question, 2 things. First, talk, if you would, Joe, a little bit about ReliaTack, the opportunity to roll out. And what is it all about? Is this just a better ability to attack -- to tack mesh and leading to less post-op pain due to the tacking? And maybe talk about some of the cost benefits? And then just last, on robotics, you've talked a lot about a program that -- a new MIS program that would offer some robotic benefits without the capital expenditure. Just can you update us where you are there and maybe your latest thoughts?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
I like your creativity in putting 2 questions into 1. That's -- just set the criteria going forward. We -- when you look at ReliaTack, the positioning of tackers is not an easy thing. You've got a -- some tackers, you need to position them vertically or perpendicular to the surface. It depends upon the size of the incision, becomes a little bit more complex. And so the objective of -- when you're putting a mesh in -- I'm not being a physician, I'm just saying as an executive of medical technology company who understands a little bit of anatomy, I would say that you will need to put a mesh in and the least amount of tacks, or tackers, possible. So having on articulating device, it gives the physician the ability to put that tacker perpendicular, and the grip is at a different angle, offers a great possibility for better utilization of tacker technology. So that is just to prove how much we continue to invest in a franchise that Covidien is the leader today in fixation. And that will help us become a leader, I have no doubt, in a couple of years in the synthetic mesh business. When it comes to robotics, we are advanced and very happy with the program that we have. It is a program we have not spoken a lot about. It's based in 3 different places in the world where the expertise lies. We have a relentless effort to make sure that once you come up with something along those lines, it will be at a cost that is effective to the hospital. We're not coming up with systems that already are in existence. That model seems to be a little prone to failure when it comes to the cost of procedure and how things get reimbursed and how the effectiveness in a larger population of general surgery procedures would behave. So we're working very hard, and we have very good progress from the -- and the end factors that go -- that will go into this piece, as well as the units themselves. As I said, we base our R&D efforts in 3 different places in the world and have been going on for over 2 years. So we're very, very confident we're going to come up with something. I'm not going to commit on the time, but something that will be different and hopefully and possibly better than what's out there today.

The next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Maybe a broad question for Joe on the strategic aspect of the Medtronic-Covidien deal. One of the benefits here is product breadth and selling to the hospital. Both companies have certainly indicated this would be a benefit going for the forward. Some of the other competitors in the space have mixed views about that benefit over the near term. Joe, can you provide us an update on how you see the combination benefiting from the scale standpoint assuming the transaction closes early next year?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Thank you. Listen, the -- several aspects of this deal, which are strategically in nature and they'll vary in time. You have specifically the ability to synergize businesses like the Peripheral Vascular. We have a wonderful and probably second to none in the marketplace energy portfolio today. Medtronic has some of that portfolio in some areas. So bringing technologies together, some of the technological aspect, from the synergistic products that we have and they don't have and vice versa, as well as the ability to position this company as an opinion maker in health care, not just being a vendor to a hospital. We need to elevate the conversation between being a vendor and being a partner. And I think a company of this size, with some of the efforts that Omar Ishrak and his team has -- have done in the last couple of years in becoming more of a partner and looking at how the service of this organization can help hospitals reduce costs, plus what Covidien is doing, what we call our programs that go into the hospitals to help physicians minimize procedure costs, so then those are the immediate strategic synergies. Secondly, you have the cost synergies here that will bring together a great opportunity for reinvestment into the company, like Omar has said in the past, as well as going back to the shareholders and giving this back in terms of EPS. I will say the volume of products we'll be making and the relevance of what we'll be producing 6 to 7 categories, they're the most purchased in hospitals across the world. So I think we will have a voice at the table in how we can do this more effectively and change how things are done today for the benefit of the patient and the provider as well as the shareholders.

Your next question comes from Richard Newitter of Leerink Partners.
Robert Justin Marcus - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division
This is Rob in for -- it's actually Rob in for Richard. I have -- first one in the share gains in the Advanced Surgical landscape. I just want to get your take on the competitive dynamics there. And then sort of any benefits that you're seeing from the injunction in October regarding litigation with Ethicon?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Yes, I was going to ask Cole to place the question for somebody to ask us about our fantastic performance in Advanced Surgical because we spoke now for about 45 minutes and that was not even spoken about. So I'm glad you gave me an opportunity to just give my two cents of what I think about that business. First of all, we have done between the Tri-Staple, the buttress material reload that we just launched about 6 months ago, as well as the Energy portfolio, a wonderful job across the globe. If you look at the growth and you compare to our nearest competitor, there's no comparison. So there's market share being taken advantage of, market development open to MIS as well as solidifying our position across the globe as the company that is the leader in endomechanical for laparoscopy surgery. So this journey is not going to stop shortly. I just spoke -- I think there's a question before, a couple questions that go about how this is going to migrate into robotics. So Covidien is positioned to continue to gain market share, and I see very little chance in the near future for this dynamic to change. I'll tell you that the people who manage these businesses, Chris Barry and the team across the globe, have done a superb job positioning the portfolio to be a winner portfolio. So I'll say that we have more product launches coming. If I had an opportunity to bring you guys to our labs, you'll see the automation portion of it and how information technology now is going to be penetrating into the more automated parts of the handle of our endomechanical devices. So there's a significant amount of R&D continuing to be done, plus the sales and marketing capability of our teams have decided -- have a decisive part in creating this market share gain.

Your next question comes from Mike Matson of Needham.
Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
I guess I just wanted to get some perspective on Given Imaging. I think you mentioned that -- during the prepared remarks it was doing well. But can you give us some more detail on how that's doing and I guess more specifically just on the PillCam colon product?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
We're doing slightly better than our plans. That business is fully integrated in our businesses. I think we're starting to see some great potential in Japan. I was just there. And I think that market was one of the key things for Covidien in terms of acquiring Given, is to really unleash the Japanese market right away, and we're doing that. We've been very consistent with our growth profile and consistent with the growth before we purchased. So we have now launched big [ph] and this acquisition was integrated very quickly and we are doing well, as I said, in the geographies. All the reports that I have, all the post-acquisition meetings that I have indicate that this is a franchise that will do extremely well like we have planned. So there is nothing there that has not performed as planned. And actually, it's a little better than planned.

The next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So I was wondering, Joe, if you could just maybe give us a perspective on -- I know everything looks at, like, the organic growth and acquisitions added 200 basis points. But all of the things that you've been adding in are certainly more -- of faster growth potential. So maybe, I don't know if there's a way to just kind of comment on some of these inbound acquisitions and what kind of the underlying growth rate of that would be since presumably, after the anniversary, they have a more favorable impact on the underlying trends.
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Well, we are balancing these acquisitions. We can't -- when we look at our discount cash flow of all Covidien's initiatives on a 10-year basis and we start plugging in those acquisitions, we can't have only no revenue or low revenue PMA product acquisitions in the pipeline because despite the fact that you may increase the alpha of our portfolio, you can increase the volatility tremendously. Okay? So the acquisition of companies like Given, the acquisition of the device that cleans the endoscopes, that we did this year, all of them bring revenue. They have good growth, sustainable growth. However, we need, in some of our franchises like Neurovascular. It's an arms race. You've got to be able to be there with the new devices coming out, devices are life-saving. So for those businesses, we tolerate some dilution. We tolerate some of the long-term risk that offers high alpha. So you will see Covidien, if you look back, we have this mix of technology acquisition as well as short-term, good tuck-ins that will go in the bag and help us make the next 4 quarters, 8 quarters, 12 quarters.
[Audio Gap]
There's other acquisitions, which are using EPS coming along, so we have great technology, inter-secular baskets coming up in a couple of years. We have some really good things in Neurovascular that Brett Wall is doing a great job on managing. So you'll see -- if Covidien would -- ought to stay -- was to stay as an independent company, you would see us continue down this path. We do a very thorough job in portfolio management to make sure that we are not overestimating the alpha and driving the volatility of the portfolio to a point that becomes very risky in terms of achieving growth above market for the future.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And I'll take that extra question and just ask Chuck. If you could quantify FX this quarter? I know you said it was favorable, but I'm sorry if I missed any specific quantification on either the margin or the EPS line?
Charles J. Dockendorff
For the quarter, it added about $0.07 EPS on the foreign exchange and roughly about 150 basis points to our gross margin line, Of that 260, 150 was related to foreign exchange.
Operator
The next question comes from Brooks West of Piper Jaffray.
Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
Chuck, I had a follow-up on the operating leverage discussion from this quarter. A very common set of questions from investors has been, what could mature operating margins look like and specifically looking at the SG&A line, understanding the implications of emerging market investment. So I just wanted to push you on that a little bit. As we look forward how this business might mature under Medtronic, where do you think operating margins can get to and specifically SG&A within that? And then I had one follow-up if Cole will allow me.
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, I mean, I think in the past, as we mentioned, we were going after that double-digit growth on the EPS line, which we would have to drive through some operating income leverage. I think you see we achieved like a little under 23%, and it was up 70 basis points over the prior year for the full year. But I think you're going to see -- what our plan was going into it was to drive somewhere between 50 to about 75 basis point improvement on operating margin on the bottom line still making investments and you're offsetting that with significant productivity. I think on the productivity for the year, we probably had roughly -- when you back out -- take away inflation and some of the investments we're making and the portfolio moves, we had close to 300 basis points of productivity on the SG&A line. Again, that's offset by those other components I've talked about. But that's pretty significant. But those are the kind of plans we have in place. As the company goes with Medtronic, certainly there's a whole other set of synergies that come with that, that are above and beyond what we had in our plan. So it's hard to talk about Covidien as a standalone going forward within Medtronic. But I think for us, we would try to drive that increase in operating margin 50 basis points a year in order to achieve the bottom line double-digit EPS growth.
Brooks E. West - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
And the follow-up for Joe, maybe let me ask the Minnesota question. How are you managing employee turnover coming into the deal? And specifically, if you look at -- Peripheral Vascular and Neuro, I think, are the 2 divisions or franchises that Medtronic has called out as -- to be integrated into their business. How are you seeing turnover? And kind what are you doing to manage that as you look into the transaction?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
We do what best practices call across-the-board. We do a large acquisition. You have retention plans. You have engagement meetings with your employees. You do the best you can. Clearly, you will lose people along the way, but we're trying to minimize that and we're been very successful to date. Let me underscore that. The question regarding the PV and NV business. Those businesses -- first of all, the NV business, I don't -- Medtronic doesn't have one. So this is a great complement for Chris O'Connor's business to bring -- they bring stimulation. And the whole neurological business of this franchise will fit that quite well, and I don't think at this moment in time there is any plan to dismantle that or put anywhere other than actually keep as is and move it in because of the performance and the uniqueness of the endovascular aspect of our franchise. On the PV side is we have what they don't have. So is 1 plus 1 equals 3 or 4? As I said in the beginning, this acquisition is 1 plus 1 equals 5. So when you look at those businesses, 1 equals 1 -- 1 plus 1 equals 3 or 4 here. So that I don't think those businesses are being -- business to be synergized from the cost point of view, but just to accelerate sales, market share growth. Those are the things you want, too. And I think that's what in their mind. I don't want to speak for Medtronic, neither Omar, but I believe that was one of the premises that we've put in place.
Coleman N. Lannum
Operator, why don't we go with one more question? And then folks, please do stick around after that. We have a couple of comments we want to summarize with -- after the call.
Operator
The next question comes from Ms. Shagun Singh of CRT Capital Group.
Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division
I was curious about the comments you made on your robotic platforms, and I was hoping for some clarification. You mentioned that you're establishing a more cost-effective way for hospitals to approach robotics, and the current model is prone to failure even as Surgical volumes are stable to modestly up. Can you provide more color on that? What is the price sensitivity for hospitals right now to high capital equipment? And just general comments on hospitals' shift to value. And then even on the procedure side, can you talk to us about which procedures you're seeing growth in? And then if I could please squeeze in a follow-up on the transaction.
Coleman N. Lannum
Boy, oh boy, I counted 17 questions there. And -- well, that's something we ended up.
JosÃ© E. Almeida
I'll get -- I didn't catch the last part of your question. If you don't mind to repeat about the transaction.
Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division
And so...
Coleman N. Lannum
She was asking a little backwards.
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Oh, okay. Okay, okay. So that's why I didn't catch the question. So listen, I can't speak for other companies, but I can speak for Covidien's premises of launching a -- we don't call it robotics because this is not how we would qualify it. This is an automation of surgery. This is an enhancement of precision in surgery and uses robotics as one of its utilitarian vehicles to get there, first of all. Second of all, for us to go after this automation market with a premise that whatever we're going to do is going to cost to the hospitals more money than the current cost of MIS. It is the current model in the marketplace. It seems to me, contrary to anything that -- as a health care executive who has been in the business for over 20-plus years and understand a little bit of our market, it seems counterintuitive that this model is sustainable, meaning when you're going to have 2 competitors or perhaps 3 competitors in the marketplace going after this market. So it can be more costly to a hospital to go into general surgery to perform procedures that today are doing very effectively using just minimally invasive surgery techniques. So for us to get into this business, we need to pass that threshold that is, you cannot produce equipment that will cost a hospital on the DRG basis higher cost than they are paying today for regular MIS. Otherwise, you don't create expansion of MIS. I think there's great advantage for people, organization and other things. But at the end of the day, U.S. is not the only market where this can be applied, and we're going to have a hard time outside the U.S. and other markets to create a model that is sustainable like that, okay? Technology is not the cure of all maladies, so we understand in Covidien how we need to mix both of them. Secondly, you need to think through health care not in a 1 or 2 years. You've got to think in -- of health care on a 10-year span and how do you create value not only for the provider, the payer, the patient first in mind and our shareholders. So when we put this all together, I think the solution we're going to bring to the market will aim to go after those parameters.
Coleman N. Lannum
And Shagun, what was your follow-up question on the transaction itself?
Shagun Singh Chadha - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division
Yes. So I was just wondering, if all goes as planned, what is the time line between the S-4 becoming effective and closing?
Coleman N. Lannum
Yes. I think what we've said about that is first of all, the closing date, we've now said, will be in early 2015. In between the S-4 and the close, the things that we need to do is we need to finish up all of the geographies for antitrust passing, and we need to get successful shareholder vote for both Medtronic and for Covidien. At this point, we can't comment on the timing of the shareholder vote because that's still dependent upon getting the S-4 made effective. Having said that, last week is when we filed a joint 8-K with Medtronic. We said we feel we will be closing the deal in the first part of calendar 2015.
Thank you, operator, and thank you, Shagun, and thanks, everybody, for your questions. Stick with me for just one second here. A couple of follow-up items.
First of all, a replay of the call will be available on our corporate website, covidien.com, and as well for dial-in after this call. In addition, for analysts having more detailed questions involving nonmaterial information, of course Todd and I will be available all day to take your calls.
Before we wrap up today, I'd like to throw it back over to Joe Almeida, our CEO. He has a couple of final comments he'd like to leave you with. Joe?
JosÃ© E. Almeida
Thank you, Cole. Listen, all of you on the call, you have been following Covidien for many years, and I'd like to thank you all, the sell-side and the buy-side folks who have followed Covidien, people who believe that we had a good story back in 2007 and for the ones who believe the story was not that great. But I hope we're able to prove to all of you guys that we have a solid management team, that we're able to deliver not only to our shareholders but also value to the health care market in general.
So I'd like to thank you and relay our management team's appreciation for your support and following all these years. I wish you a great future and good luck.
And lastly, I would like to deeply thank our management team and all the employees of Covidien who have made this company a success that it is today. There's nobody else in the world that deserve more credit than the employees of Covidien, who were able to pull this company through a very shaky beginning with very difficult competitors in the marketplace to one of the best names in health care. So to them go all the credit. So thank you very much. You all have a good day.
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks, everyone.
Operator
