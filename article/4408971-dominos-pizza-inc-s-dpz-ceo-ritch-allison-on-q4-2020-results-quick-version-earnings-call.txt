Stu Levy
Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Weâre excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year. Twenty twenty. Despite the ongoing.
Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year, twenty twenty. Despite the ongoing global challenges presented by covid-19, before we jump into the numbers, I would first like to remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year, which also included New Yearâs Eve and New Yearâs Day, both of which are typically major sales days. We have an extra week in our fiscal year every five or six years, depending on how the calendar falls. Typically, our fiscal year consists of three 12 week quarters and a 16 week fourth quarter. But in twenty twenty, our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. In the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of this additional week has been adjusted out of our twenty twenty results as an item affecting comparability.
The next time this will happen is in twenty twenty six. Turning to our results overall, our team members and franchisees around the world generated strong operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of three point eighty five cents for Q4 and twelve dollars and thirty nine cents for the full year. Diluted EPS, as adjusted for the extra week in our fiscal year, was three dollars and forty six cents for Q4 and twelve dollars and one cent for the full year. Hereâs some additional detail on the components of our earnings. In Q4, global retail sales grew twenty one point seven percent as compared to Q4 twenty nineteen. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which Iâll break down for you in a moment. Our global retail sales in Q4 were benefited by the extra week and also by a weaker dollar when excluding the extra week and the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 12 percent for the full year.
Our global retail sales grew twelve point five percent. When excluding the extra week and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew ten point four percent. Breaking down our global retail sales growth, our U.S. retail sales grew twenty two point eight percent during Q4 and seventeen point six percent for the full year when excluding the extra week, U.S. retail sales grew fourteen point three percent in Q4 and 15 percent for the full year. Our international retail sales grew twenty point seven percent during Q4 and seven point five percent for the full year. When excluding the extra week and the impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew nine point nine percent for Q4 and five point nine percent for the full year.
During Q4, we continue to see positive momentum in our international business, including a reduction in temporary store closures and other operating restrictions which contributed to sequentially stronger same store sales performance and an increase in net units, which Iâll discuss in more detail momentarily. Turning to comps during Q4, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 39 straight quarters of positive US comparable sales and one hundred and eight consecutive quarters or twenty seven years of positive international comps, both truly remarkable achievements. Same store sales in the US grew eleven point two percent in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of three point four percent and same store sales for our international business grew seven point three percent, rolling over a prior year increase of one point seven percent.
As a reminder, our same store sales growth is not affected by the extra week. Breaking down the US, our franchise business increased eleven point four percent in the quarter, while our company owned stores were up eight point one percent, the US comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. Within that mix, our ticket growth was driven by an increase in items for order and a higher delivery mix, which often comes with an associated, transparent delivery fee. The seven point three percent international comp was driven by ticket growth, similar to in our US business, that ticket growth was driven by both a higher item count and a higher delivery mix shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added one hundred sixteen net stores in the US during the fourth quarter, consisting of one hundred and eighteen store openings and two closures for the full year, we and our franchisees opened two hundred twenty nine net US stores.
Our international business added two hundred seventy two net stores during Q4, comprised of three hundred and twenty eight store openings and 56 closures for the full year, we added three hundred ninety five net international stores in total. We and our franchisees opened six hundred and twenty four stores globally in twenty twenty. Weâre very pleased with our ability to continue to grow units during the pandemic and particularly encouraged by our strong growth in Q4. However, we do still face some challenges opening stores in certain markets, including delays in construction and permitting, which we will continue to monitor moving forward. Regarding revenues and operating margins, total revenues.
Regarding revenues and operating margins, total revenues for the fourth quarter were one point four billion and weâre up two hundred and six million, or seventeen point nine percent from the prior year quarter. Total revenues for the year were four point one billion. And weâre up four hundred and ninety nine million, or thirteen point eight percent from prior year. The extra week increased revenues by an estimated eighty eight million dollars. The remaining increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which in turn drove higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by zero point four million in Q4 as compared to Q4 twenty nineteen and negatively impacted our royalty revenues by three point nine million for the full year as compared to twenty nineteen.
Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues increased to thirty nine point five percent from thirty eight point nine percent in Q4 twenty nineteen, due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business, partially offset by investments made related to the covid-19 pandemic company owned store margin as a percent of revenue decreased to twenty one point nine percent from twenty four point four percent in Q4 twenty nineteen and was negatively impacted by higher covid related labor costs.
As we announced in December of twenty twenty, we paid a special bonus to our front line workers to thank them for their contributions throughout the pandemic. Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue increase to eleven point six percent from eleven point one percent in Q4 twenty nineteen, driven by operating efficiencies and reduced fuel expenses.
G&A expenses increased approximately 19 million in Q4, twenty twenty as compared to Q4, twenty nineteen for the full year, our Jeanna was four hundred seven million, an increase of approximately twenty four million as compared to prior year. We estimate that six million of these expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week this year. The remaining increase primarily related to higher variable performance based compensation, expense and professional fees and was partially offset by lower travel expenses.
Net interest expense increased approximately eight million in the quarter as compared to Q4 twenty nineteen, we estimate that three million of this increase was driven by the extra week this year. The remaining increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our twenty nineteen recapitalization transaction and was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rates. Our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to three point nine percent from four point zero percent in Q4 twenty nineteen due to the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in Q4. Twenty twenty as compared to Q4. Twenty nineteen.
Our reported effective tax rate was nineteen point nine percent for the quarter as compared to seventeen point eight percent in Q4 twenty nineteen the reported effective tax rate in Q4. Twenty twenty included a one point eight percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity based compensation, as compared to a three point nine percentage point positive impact in Q4. Twenty nineteen. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity based compensation tax benefits. When you combine all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up twenty two point six million or seventeen point five percent over Q4, twenty nineteen for the full year, our net income was up ninety point six million, or twenty two point six percent over twenty nineteen.
We estimate that the fifty third week positively impacted net income by 15 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to the additional week of sales and the associated operating leverage, which is included as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release. Our diluted EPS in Q4 was three dollars and eighty five cents versus three dollars and 12 cents in the prior year, an increase of twenty three point four percent. Our diluted EPS as adjusted in Q4 was three dollars and forty six cents versus diluted EPS as adjusted of three dollars and 13 cents in Q4. Twenty nineteen, an increase of ten point five percent. Breaking down that thirty three cent increase a bit, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by thirty four cents. Are lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases during 20 20 benefited us by 16 cents. Iâll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from the higher average debt balances I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted us by 10 cents. And finally, our higher effective tax rate, resulting primarily from lower tax benefits on equity based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by seven cents for the full year or diluted EPS was twelve dollars and thirty nine cents versus nine dollars and fifty six cents in the prior year, an increase of twenty nine point six percent or diluted EPS as adjusted for the full year, was twelve dollars and one cent versus diluted EPS as adjusted of nine dollars and fifty seven cents in twenty nineteen, an increase of twenty five point five percent. Shifting to cash, our economic model remains strong, and it continued to generate significant free cash flow throughout the quarter. During full year twenty twenty, we generated net cash provided by operating operating activities of approximately five hundred ninety three million dollars. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately five hundred and four million regarding our capital expenditures.
We spent approximately eighty nine million on CapEx in twenty twenty, primarily on our supply chain centers and technology initiatives. During Q4, we also repurchased and retired approximately five hundred and sixty eight thousand shares for two hundred and twenty five dollars million or three ninety six per share on average, bringing our twenty 20 total repurchases to three hundred and five million. Subsequently, weâve also repurchased an incremental sixty six thousand shares for twenty five million dollars year to date in Q1. Twenty twenty one related to our repurchases. Weâre also pleased to announce that as you saw in this morningâs earnings release, our Board of directors has approved a new one billion dollar share repurchase program, which is replace the remaining authorization under our existing program.
Additionally, during Q4, we returned sixty one million dollars to our shareholders in the form of two seventy eight cent quarterly dividend payments, bringing our twenty twenty total dividend payments to one hundred twenty two million dollars. As we move into twenty twenty one, weâre excited to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 94 cents per share to be paid on March 30th, an increase of twenty one percent over the previous quarters dividend. When you add the share repurchases and quarterly dividends, the cumulative impact is that we return more than four hundred and twenty five million dollars to shareholders in twenty twenty.
Before wrapping up the financial update, Iâd like to walk you through the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our Q4 results. As we have done in previous quarters during Q4, the estimated total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members and support for our franchisees and our communities with seven million dollars. As we look ahead, we would like to remind you of the twenty twenty one outlook items that we communicated in mid-January, as well as provide you with a longer range outlook.
We currently project that the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up two and a half to three and a half percent as compared to twenty 20 levels. And we do expect some volatility around that range quarter to quarter. We estimate that foreign currency could have a four to eight million dollar positive impact on royalty revenues in twenty twenty one as compared to twenty twenty. We anticipate our growth, our gross capex investments to be approximately one hundred million as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in technology, innovation, new stores and supply chain capacity. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of four hundred and fifteen to four hundred and twenty five million. Keep in mind that GenÃ© expense can vary up or down depending on. Among other things, our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance based compensation expense as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising. In addition, in this morningâs earnings release, we also announced our two to three year outlook of six to 10 percent global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency.
Ritch Allison
We invested in equipment and processes designed to ensure their safety and an enhanced sick pay and benefits and enhanced hourly wages, recognizing the unique challenges of working during the pandemic, including the nearly 10 million dollars in bonuses that we paid to our corporate store and supply chain team members in the month of December. And we invested in our communities throughout twenty twenty partnering with our franchisees to donate 10 million slices to first responders, frontline workers and families in need responding to natural disasters by getting food to people in need.
Launching a national hiring campaign to provide thirty thousand jobs to workers who may have been displaced from their launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from theirs, launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from their. Committing three million dollars to support black communities in the US, including one million dollars to establish the Dominoâs black franchise, the Opportunity Fund, and partnering with our franchisees to raise one hundred million dollars over the next 10 years for St. Jude Childrenâs Research Hospital, we and our franchisees raised thirteen million dollars for St. Jude in twenty twenty alone. Now, looking ahead to 2020 and our U.S. business, we will continue as a work in progress brand, striving to get a little better each and every day. And Iâll highlight a few focus areas. And not surprisingly, most of these areas will not be new news to you. First, we will continue to forgerâs our markets, driving faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for drivers and incremental carry out traffic. Forecasting will continue to drive overall store growth, and in twenty twenty one, including in our company owned markets, we will continue to deliver new product innovation in twenty, twenty one. We will continue to produce World-Class advertising and weâre excited to begin our relationship with work and progress as our new advertising agency.
We will continue to invest in technology to enable great customer experiences to drive speed, accuracy and efficiency inside our stores to improve our corporate store team members ability to support our business. Value is always a key focus for us, and that wonât change in twenty, twenty one more than ever. With many Americans out of work in these uncertain economic times, value matters and we are committed to maintaining our unquestioned position of value leadership within the QSR pizza segment. Weâre ramping up our focus on service in twenty twenty one, getting pizzas out the door to our customers hotter, fresher and more reliably than ever before. Through innovation within our stores, weâre doubling down with technology, with training and with communications. We will continue to invest in our frontline team members across our corporate stores and supply chain centers, increasing hourly wages in many markets and enhancing our team member benefits. We will also be taking a comprehensive look at our environmental impact within the next one to three years. We will set science based, time bound commitments in accordance with the science based targets initiative process to reduce the companyâs total contribution to climate change. And as always, we will remain obsessed, absolutely obsessed with franchisee profitability. Stu shared our initial 20 20 store level EBITDA estimate with you in January and we will share the final number with you when that figure is ready.
But we do expect it to be higher than the estimate that Stu shared with you last month. While we believe this level of profitability and associated cash on cash returns exceeds any player in our category, we recognize that some of our franchises and our corporate stores are under intense cost pressure. You know, despite higher overall levels of unemployment across the country, many local labor markets remain tight and wages continue to rise. Across the country, fixed costs such as rent and insurance also bring added pressure. But my team and I recognize these challenges, and we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees, just as we are for our corporate markets. As I look back on the fourth quarter and on the full year, Iâm very happy with our U.S. performance, we achieved our thirty nine consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth and we surpassed eight billion dollars in U.S. retail sales for the very first time. I am confident that we are well-positioned to continue playing the long game in our US business. Now Iâm going to move on to international. During the fourth quarter, our pandemic recovery continued as we reopen stores and delivered the strongest quarterly.
Weâve reported in four years we marked our one hundred eight straight positive quarter, thatâs twenty seven full years, an incredible run that seemed in doubt when covid struck early in the year. And Iâm particularly pleased that our master franchisees continue to invest in the business, opening 270 to net stores in the quarter and three hundred and ninety five net for the full year. Now, when you consider that we had about twenty four hundred stores temporarily closed back in Q2, this is truly a remarkable achievement and it highlights the terrific unit level economics that our master franchisees have built in many markets around the globe. There is no question that we had more closures in twenty twenty eight. In fact, we had over three hundred than you would normally see from Dominoâs in a typical year. This was driven by strategic choices in several markets to close some previously underperforming units, including a number of units with formats that admittedly would have struggled in the new operating environment rather than reopening them after the pandemic. So when I look forward, I am very optimistic about our master franchisees ability to ramp up our unit growth across the international business, and I want to thank our international partners for their engagement. Throughout the year, we dramatically increased our communication across the system and master franchisees from all over the world really leaned in sharing best practices throughout the year to help their peers and to help our US team manage through the pandemic.
This truly demonstrated the power of the global Dominoâs system, and we could not have responded so effectively to covid without this level of partnership. Now, Iâd love to share a few, 20, 20 market highlights. We open for the first time in Croatia, welcoming the team there to the Dominoâs family. We opened ninety five net stores in China and grew retail sales by over 30 percent, accelerating growth in this very important market. We were also very pleased to invest in Dasht Brands, our master franchise partner with a 40 million dollar investment in twenty twenty and the subsequent forty million dollar investment which we completed in Q1 of this year.
We are excited to partner more deeply with their terrific management team and investors, and I am more optimistic than ever about the potential for Dominoâs in China. Japan was an incredible success story in 20 20, passing the 700 store milestone with one hundred net stores and over 40 percent in retail sales growth. Germany is another market that saw outstanding retail sales growth of over twenty five percent with one hundred excuse me, where we are fast approaching three hundred and fifty stores with much potential for future growth. Iâd also like to thank our teams that worked incredibly hard to reopen stores throughout the year following the covid driven closures, India, France, Spain, Mexico, New Zealand and Panama are a few of the markets, along with many others around the world that have pushed hard to bounce back from significant temporary closures and to position themselves for growth in twenty twenty one.
Based on the latest reports, we now have fewer than one hundred and fifty temporary international store closures. Now, when we look at this recovery in our international business, India deserves a specific mention. After some strategic store closures earlier in the year, jubilant Foodworks, our master franchise partner, dramatically accelerated growth with 50 net stores in their most recent reported quarter. And as we look forward into twenty twenty one, I remain very optimistic about the long term growth potential of our international business. The opportunity is there. Our unit economics are strong and our master franchisees are committed. Combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing around the globe, we have the recipe to take this business to its full potential.
So in closing, 20 20 was a year like none other. But Dominoâs is a brand like none other. I am proud of our franchise partners and our team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. And as we look ahead to twenty twenty one, we are sure exactly what the new normal will look like or when weâll get there. But we will remain diligently focused on delivering for our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and.
Shareholders. At Dominoâs, we have a long track record of profitable growth driven by a disciplined operating model. This model served us well and 20 20 and will continue to be the foundation for our growth in twenty, twenty one and beyond. This gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to grow the Dominoâs brand over the long term. That confidence is demonstrated in this morningâs release, where we announced our new two to three year outlook of six to 10 percent global retail sales growth and six to eight percent global net unit growth, as well as our new one billion dollar share repurchase program. So Iâll end my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchise partners and team members. And thatâs not just for your efforts in twenty twenty, but also for your continued perseverance in twenty twenty one as we battled covid and the recent winter storms across the US. I am proud to serve you each and every day. And with that, Stu and I will be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question at this time, this press star, then the number one key on your touchtone telephone, if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, this press the pound key. Just a reminder, you are only allowed to ask one question on your turn. Thank you. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner
Thanks. Good morning, Rich. Good morning. Appreciate all the remarks and I appreciate the reinstatement of a two to three year sales outlook. And I understand that this year youâll be lapping in an unprecedented situation from 2020 and that, you know, the visibility may not be as high as normal, but when youâre talking about six to eight percent unit growth, six to 10 percent retail sales growth, does this view also specifically apply to how you are thinking? And we should think about 2021, at least on the unit growth side. You know, it seemed like you had a really nice step up in trends in the fourth quarter, so any additional color would be really helpful. Thank you.
Stu Levy
Sure. Thanks, Brian. Appreciate the question. And, you know, you know, our new outlook that weâve published is a two to three year look. But specifically to your question on the unit growth. You know, we were really pleased to see some significant momentum building in the fourth quarter of the year, as you saw in in in the store growth numbers that we published both for the U.S. business and for the international business. And, you know, the reality is there was a lot of pent up demand out there throughout the course of the year where we just had challenges getting stores opened up, you know, due to due to construction and permitting and other issues. But the fundamental unit level economics in the business have never been better. You shared a preliminary look at US store level EBITDA last month. And as we as we tabulate the final numbers, we expect it to be at least that one hundred and fifty eight thousand or higher. So terrific economics in the business. Our approach to forecasting in the U.S. and in our international markets is still is still working very, very well for us. And then as it relates to the to the global retail sales growth number, you know, while covid gave us some tailwind on that in the US, it was actually a headwind in the international side of the business. When you look at all the temporary store closures that we had back in in the second quarter where we were up around twenty four hundred units that were closed, which had a significant impact, as you know, on retail sales back then. So weâre optimistic, Brian, as we look forward and that optimism is reflected in in that new outlook that we published this morning.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sara Senatore
Oh, thank you. I wanted to ask about the U.S. kind of competitive background. I was interested. You said the story of 20 20 was really about increased orders and span from existing customers. I know that you always get a lot of questions about consolidation and independence, but I guess my sense would be then, based on what youâre talking about in your business, that maybe the whole category saw a nice tailwind, including both big competitors and independents. So maybe less about share shifts to Dominoâs and more about an aggregate kind of.
A rising tide. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that now that weâre a year into the pandemic, you know, if you have a better sense of maybe where the traffic was coming from are going to and what the interest segment dynamics look like. Thank you.
Ritch Allison
Sure. Thanks, Sarah. And, well, as I answer your question, Iâll break it down a bit across the two businesses that we run out of, each of our out of each of our boxes, you know, across the country. So if you start with the delivery business, youâre most certainly the pandemic brought a tailwind in the delivery business, you know, not just for Dominoâs Pizza, but across the category and frankly, across categories. And, you know, during the year we saw, you know, strong growth in both order counts and also growth in ticket in that delivery business as customers tended to order more pizzas. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, you know, we also saw that in particular, our twenty seven million active loyalty members, you know, ordered more from us. Their frequency increased during the year. If you contrast that with the carry out business carry out in the carry out business, covid actually brought a headwind. You know, for us in terms of customer activity is as fewer as fewer customers during the pandemic. You know, weâre comfortable going out and walking into restaurants even to pick up carry out. Know, we did see some pressure on order counts in the carry out business in the growth story there in twenty twenty. It was really around ticket. Now, prior to the pandemic, that carry out business has been a terrific source of customer acquisition and order count growth for us. So as we look forward into twenty, twenty one, you know, that is one of the important drivers that we see in terms of our ability to continue to grow sales in the US is, you know, the is the restart of that growth on the carry out side of the business.
Stu Levy
And so one thing Iâd add to that is, you know, keep in mind, I think as weâve said before, in a lot of cases, the carry out customer is different from the delivery customer. So itâs not necessarily a shift from carryout to delivery with the same customer base. Itâs an increase in delivery and a headwind and carry out. And thatâs one of the reasons that we have such a high degree of confidence and kind of excitement about what that business can bring to us moving forward.
Sara Senatore
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris OâCull with Stifel. Your line is open.
Chris OâCull
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Rich Several restaurants have accelerated their investments in technology, given the increase theyâve seen in digital orders. And some of these companies are probably starting with newer technology that Iâm guessing Dominoâs might have even. So do you believe Dominoâs needs to ramp up its investment or accelerate plans to ensure its tech does not get surpassed by some of the competitors?
Ritch Allison
Yeah, Chris, a great question. And the answer is, you know, weâve been investing for a long time and we continue to increase that investment each and every year in technology, because youâre absolutely right. You know that the half life of any lead that you have is pretty short on that side of the business. And, you know, our investments will continue. They did in twenty twenty and weâll continue to going forward. Weâre continuing to make great progress with the development of our next generation of our pulse software, which is really the heartbeat of our of our stores. Weâre continuing to invest in our digital ordering platforms. As well, and we saw a really nice growth in in digital ordering, you know, during 20, 20 hour digital sales for the year went up about five points over twenty nineteen. You know, we ran about seventy five percent digital sales throughout twenty twenty. So we will weâll continue to make investments there to drive the business on the customer side. Weâre also ramping up our investments in technology as it relates to how we operate our stores. So Iâve talked a little bit about GPS tracking where we invested in that in twenty 20, substantially rolled that out across the entire US system. Weâll continue to invest there and also additional technology tools at the make line and at the cut table inside our stores to make the jobs easier for our team members and to help us to get pizzas out the door faster to our customers.
Chris OâCull
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open at.
Lauren Silberman
Padbury is outpacing international competition from the growth of third party delivery, customer and geographic expansion.
Ritch Allison
Lauren, we canât we canât hear you here. I wonder if you could start over maybe a little closer to your mike.
Stu Levy
So, yeah, youâre breaking up.
Lauren Silberman
Go back to.
Ritch Allison
Why donât we go to the next question and Lauren will come back and try again later?
Operator
The next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe
Hi. Thank you. I know you guys arenât going to for a lot of logical reasons, give quarterly comp guidance, especially with the comparisons that are about to change so meaningfully, you know, in coming weeks. But I did just want to get your overall thoughts, especially as you do have some leading indicators of markets that have reopened. And, you know, most people talk about the reopening trade of people going back and dining in restaurants. And, you know, a lot of the consumer packaged food companies seem to suggest that theyâre not going to lose very much of their own business that theyâve generated through grocery in 2020. You know, so the question is, as we think about the second half of 2001 versus second half of nineteen, or even if we think about, you know, 22 versus 19, you know, whatâs your sense? And I guess at this point, you know, itâs a guess, but you guys get to make an educated guess using some of the early market data that you have, you know, of kind of being able to grow sales versus the nineteen level, even if we do, you know, say, hey, you know, comping against, you know, high teens classes is just always going to be difficult for any business. And we just shouldnât expect that. But how are we feeling second half a 21 or 22 versus 19, given what might be a way for at least certain groups of people to go back to dining inside of restaurants?
Ritch Allison
Hey, John, thanks. Thanks for the question and, you know, I guess what I what I would say, you know, at a at a high level is that, you know, we see a lot of not even with the tailwind that we had in in twenty twenty in the delivery business, you know, we had a headwind on the carry outside of the business, as I talked about earlier. So when I look across, you know, twenty, twenty one, you know, one important growth driver for us is going to be to reaccelerate that growth on the carry outside of the business because we know lapping, you know, some of the delivery tailwind is going to be difficult. We weâre also going to continue to invest in in value in the business as we always as we always have and making sure that, you know, as our customers, you know, continue to manage their households through what is going to be a fairly difficult economic time for a lot of Americans. We believe that continuing to stay focused on value is also going to help us. You know, as a lot of folks who have been paying a lot to have food delivered to their houses, you know, as behaviors start to change and other options open up, you know, weâre going to continue to have dominos as the unquestioned value leader in the in the QSR pizza segment and frankly, broadly across the restaurant industry, when you think about what it costs to have food delivered to feed a family of four, we really like our positioning in that space will also look throughout the year to reinitiate some of our boost weeks, you know, our aggressive value weeks that have been an important part of our strategy to acquire customers, you know, over the last a number of years. So weâre not going to do anything. You know, John, just to lap a cop, thatâs not how we thatâs not how we manage the business here. Everything that we do is going to be around. How do we continue to drive sustained and profitable long term growth for our franchisees and ourselves?
Stu Levy
And the only other thing Iâd just add to that is, you know, we also think we benefit from the fact that our store base is, you know, is everywhere. Weâre not urban dominated or suburban dominated. We hit on markets. And, you know, when you when you hear folks talking about the wave of people that are going to rush back in to dine in restaurants, theyâre generally coming from more densely populated urban perspective. Where thereâs restaurants are more prevalent as you start looking across the landscape. And you look at that relative to our store footprint, it gives us a lot of a lot of confidence to be able to weather some of that.
John Ivankoe
And do you have any evidence of markets like, you know, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, maybe, you know, certain parts of Florida that suggests that you are, you know, holding on to that business as.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks and good morning all I wanted to come back to the market share question, I think you shared ICR, some market share, the delivery, and it was, if I remember correctly, like three six percent. And that really didnât change from nineteen. So if thatâs correct or if itâs not correct, let me know. But why do you glozier here in the past and this year youâd think would be a year where you could have grown share more just given your capability. So why do you think thatâs the case? Is it just everyone got better with independents suddenly got stronger? What is it in that dynamic that maybe changed in twenty twenty? And how do you think what were the causes of it?
Ritch Allison
Yeah John, I think what we saw in twenty twenty, it was just broad growth across the categories. So while we had terrific growth in our delivery business, if there was broadly across the category, a lot of growth, you know, a lot of independents, you know, that maybe didnât have a big delivery business back in 18 and 19, they jumped in with both feet into delivery to stay alive in twenty twenty and, you know, through the use of third party aggregators to deliver their product. And that certainly, certainly resulted in some delivery growth coming from some of the some of the independents and regionals that maybe werenât wasnât there in the past.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Hey, thanks for the question and good morning.
Eric Gonzalez
Regarding the potential wage increases, I was wondering how that might impact your ability to hold on to those five nine nine seven ninety nine price points, which set a different way, recognizing that all good things might eventually come to an end. What would have to happen from an inflation perspective for you to need to back away from those platforms and what can be done to protect those price points without having to interiorly wide gap versus other items on the menu? Thanks.
Ritch Allison
Sure, Eric. So the interesting thing is today, as it relates to wage environment, we operate in a really wide spectrum of wage rates across the country as it as it is today. And I know, you know, minimum wage in particular is certainly a topic that everybody is thinking about out there. But, you know, today we operate in states that are at the federal minimum wage all the way up to places like Seattle, which are already in excess of six, 15, sixteen dollars an hour. And weâve still been able to offer the five ninety nine and seven ninety nine platforms across the country. And thereâs a couple of things that enable us to do that. One is the volumes that we run at. You know, thereâs no way you can stay at that value level without having a high volume business like we have today. Second is that our franchisees at the local level have flexibility around menu pricing and around delivery fees and their transparent delivery fees at the local level. Theyâre going to be higher in these higher wage markets than they are in some of the others. So weâve been able to manage our way through a lot of minimum wage increases across the country. And Iâll tell you, quite honestly, you know, in our in our corporate store business, you know, weâre not paying the federal minimum wage anywhere. You canât go out there and hire people at that rate. Anyway, weâre above the minimum wage, you know, both for our folks that work inside the stores and our tip drivers on the road and then in our supply chain business, you know, weâre in excess of fifteen dollars an hour everywhere we operate.
Stu Levy
Yeah, I mean, if you think about the offers, theyâve been weâve had them for years and every year we basically have wage rate increases in food cost increases and continue to drive additional profit. And, you know, for us, itâs that we do a ton of deep market research and analytics around where that profit maximizing price point is for us. So itâs not you know, itâs certainly not set arbitrarily. And that is certainly a place where we provide a ton of value to the to the consumer and weâve been able to do it, do it profitably and continue to do so.
Eric Gonzalez

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Thank you, guys. Hear me better now. Yes, much better. Thanks, Lauren.
Lauren Silberman
Iâm sorry about that. So coming into covid Dominoâs Pizza category in general is facing incremental competition from the growth in third party delivery results. You mentioned back covid the delivery channel overall has benefited with the acceleration of adoption. Then you look at the competitive environment today. Do you think Dominoâs any better and any better positioned with respect to third party delivery now that restaurants will likely be more focused on bringing back in-store traffic and thereâs some kind of regular more regulatory requirements or in a more challenging position?
Kind of regulated more regulatory requirements or in a more challenging position, given the breadth and depth of competition has increased.
Stu Levy
Yeah, Lauren, you know, for us, itâs, I guess a little bit less about regulatory, you know, I think for us we should be honest. We struggle a little bit, understanding the long term economics and some of the aggregator businesses. You know, in 60 years, weâve never made a dollar delivering a pizza. We make money on the product, but we donât make money on the delivery. So weâre just not sure how others do it. And in a world where, you know, weâre trying to shrink our delivery area to get closer to our customer for better service, a lot of these third parties are trying to expand to reach more customers, which we think just takes away from service. And, you know, when you think about the profit equation, you know, you get somebody who inserts themselves into the value chain and they have to make their money somewhere. And itâs either got to come from the restaurant or it has to come from the customer. And we think over time thatâs going to put a lot of pressure, particularly on the independent restaurants, to be able to continue to make margins in rising cost environments while paying these aggregators. And the customers over time are going to start looking at the free delivery that costs them fifteen dollars to get twelve dollars worth of food when they start digging in to look at service fees and service charges. So weâre just not sure how it all plays out. And youâve seen that with some of some of the public players in that space who have commented about the challenge of driving long term profitability as an aggregator. So, you know, for us, we continue to just be the low cost delivery provider, provide great value. And we think as long as weâre providing a great product with great service at a great value, weâll let everything else shake out. And certainly we donât know how long it will take to all shake out. But from our perspective, weâre in a pretty good spot.

Their next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger that youâve got ideas. Your line is open.
Dennis Geiger
Great. Thanks for the question. Rich, I wanted to ask a little bit more on loyalty and new product innovation as we think about 20, 21 and even going forward. Just wondering if you could talk more about those two opportunities, you know, and kind of how those might allow you to keep some of the new customers that you might have gained in twenty twenty, you know, I guess, and or attract new customers going forward. You know, I just you know, how those initiatives may help you to kind of hold or even gain category share going forward. Thanks.
Ritch Allison
Sure. Thanks for the question. So Iâll talk about loyalty, maybe even just even a little bit more, you know, more broadly, because there were a couple of metrics that I shared earlier that I think are important on this front. One is, you know, the increase in the number of active members of our piece of the Pie Rewards program, which was up to twenty seven million plus. We also saw an increase in engagement in frequency among that group as well, which is a big focus of ours. You know, once that program gets to that level of scale, you know. Twenty seven million plus and you know, weâve got beyond that, weâve got 40 million plus that at some point have been enrolled in the program and weâve got 80 million plus customers that are in our in our database. So we spent a lot of time on initiatives thinking about, you know, how can we continue to mine, you know, that treasure of customers and find ways to better serve them at their time of need to drive to drive higher frequency. Another metric I shared earlier that is also important is, you know, the increase that we saw in digital engagement with our customers, you know, with digital sales going up from 70 percent to 75 percent during the year, you know, broadly across the customer base, thatâs yet another opportunity because those customers, you know, tend our ticket tends to be higher because we do a better job with upswell on them. And once they start ordering digitally, they tend to be stickier with us over the long term. So weâll continue, as we always do, many efforts focused in that space. And then you asked about new products also. We had, as I mentioned earlier, three that we successfully launched in twenty twenty. And thatâs going to continue to be part of our playbook going forward. Weâve got some exciting things that our culinary team has been working on that I certainly like and based on our testing, a lot of our customers do as well.
So youâll see some more news coming from us in that in that space during twenty twenty one as well. Whatâs your next question?

Whatâs your next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Chris Carril
Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So just following up on the comments around carry out as well as on labor costs, how are you thinking about the carry out opportunity in the context of carry out margins versus delivery margins, just especially with the increasing focus on minimum wage and potential for increased incrementally higher labor costs?
Ritch Allison
Yeah, itâs a great question. And, you know, prior to prior to the pandemic, we had taken the carry out mix up to about forty five percent of our orders. And that mix came down a bit during covid, as we talked about earlier. Given the just the changing customer behaviors, we are very much focused on growing that carry out business in twenty, twenty one and forward. And, you know, while the ticket is lower on a carry out order, you know, to your point, thereâs so much less labor cost associated with each of those carry out orders that the higher the higher the average hourly labor rate gets in your market, you know, the more the profitability equation tilts toward those carry out orders. And this is something that weâve seen, frankly, in some of our international markets as well, which have much higher labor costs than the US does. Driving that carry out business has been a really important part of continuing to grow profitability at the store level for our franchisees. But we are profitable on both channels. Absolutely.
Chris Carril
Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Levy
Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just following up on I think it was Ericâs question with all of the moving parts that are going on there throughout the system with tough compares and just rising costs, how flexible and what are you hearing from the franchisees in terms of how theyâre thinking about approaching 2021, whether that is from a marketing standpoint or a pricing or a willingness and ability to add to their labor pool? Thank you.
Ritch Allison
Iâm sure you have great, great question. What I would tell you is that. We have such a fantastic base of franchisees across the U.S. who are excited and eager to lean in in twenty, twenty one, and thatâs in a couple of ways. You know, one that you mentioned, you adding team members to their stores. I can tell you that everyone I go out there and talk to is aggressively trying to hire and add to their teams, because funny thing happens, when you add more delivery drivers to your business, your sales go up over time. But also franchisees are also excited about, you know, continuing to invest in their businesses and build and building new stores, because as weâve continued to grow sales and as profits have increased the equation around those new store openings, particularly when weâve got places where weâre forecasting earsplitting gets even gets even more attractive. So weâve got weâve got a committed and committed group thatâs ready to lean in and invest in twenty, twenty one.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein
Great. Thank you very much. Just to follow up on the aggregator question, I know you had previously talked about consolidation within that subgroup and maybe promoting more aggressively and you guys were keen to remain solo. You know, with that said, I think weâve all seen that covid has driven large increases in at least traffic on these sites.
So even if you were to never allow aggregators to do your delivery, as you mentioned, which would allow you to retain the service levels and make sure youâre still profitable, but would you ever think about having your brand on that platform just to reach the additional eyeballs and generate the sales? Iâm just wondering what the risks might be on that front just to drive the traffic, but not necessarily pay the risk or pay the fees and have the risk of it impacting service. Thank you.
Ritch Allison
Yeah, Jim, you know, weâve looked at it many, many times over the last couple of years. And as you know, some of our international markets, you know, do, you know, gather some of their orders through aggregators? We donât allow aggregators to deliver our food anywhere. But in some context, in our international markets, itâs made some sense. Every time we look at it here in the U.S., it just doesnât make sense for us or our franchisees economically. And if it doesnât make sense economically, it certainly doesnât make sense to take the risk of sharing.
Side delivery and, you know, our aspiration here, which is well within reach, is that we get to a point where you can get a car side delivery at Dominoâs faster than you can, you know, wait in line at a QSR, drive through to get your food through the through the window and to your point on unmixed. You know, we donât weâre not sharing that externally yet for competitive reasons. But we have seen a dramatic increase in customer usage of Dominoâs car side delivery since we launched it. And part of our 20, 20 plans are going to be to drive that even higher.
Operator
All right. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Common. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles
Great. Thank you. You mentioned you guys grew the loyalty program 20 20 to a record 27 million members from about twenty five million at the end of 2019. But it looks like the level of growth slowed from roughly 20 million members in twenty eighteen to twenty five million in 2019. Can you help reconcile this, given efforts utilized in 2020 to help enroll customers in the program while there is obviously a more sedentary U.S. population? Thanks.
Ritch Allison
Sure, Andrew. So part of it is, you know, with these types of programs, you know, as they get bigger and bigger, you know, the growth in active membership gets more difficult, you know, year on year. But a couple of things that we were most pleased with. When we look back at the loyalty program, over 20, 20 was one that we grew it without, you know, in the final three quarters, the use of any of our more aggressive, massive boost weeks, you know, which are an important tool to drive customer acquisition. And then the second thing is that we were able to grow the number of customers active in the program while also still growing the frequency with which those customers order. And when you take a look at, you know, drive in volume in the business, it really is, you know, those to those two metrics in combination with one another that drive the overall increase in an engagement and sales with those loyal customers.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle
Hey, thanks. Good morning. On the franchisee profitability, obviously 20/20 was an opt out. Youâre just curious how much the reduced discounting and promotional efforts impacted the franchisee profitability and thoughts on what you think itâll look like into twenty one and beyond.
Ritch Allison
Yeah, you know, we did a terrific year on franchisee profitability and in twenty twenty and what itâs really driven by, you know, it is driven by, you know, increasing order counts, you know, across the business, particularly on the delivery side of the business, but also, you know, increasing ticket, but smart ticket, not increases in prices, but increases in the number of items that customers bought on average for each of the four each of their orders. So even in the face of some increases in labor costs and other fixed costs in the business, it really is that volume increase that drove that drove the uptick in profitability during the year. And that item, that uptick in the item count really basically gets your operating leverage in the store.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens, your line is open.
James Rutherford
Thanks for taking the question. Iâm curious about how dominos will navigate this mix shift that youâre expecting back to carry out after the big year of delivery gain. It seems like from previous comment, the carry out transaction is possibly more desirable than delivery from operators perspective, given the margins. But Iâd love to hear more color about the top line impact. I mean, to the extent that certain customers turn a delivery order during covid into a carry order, you know, for example, on the way home from work or something like that with the typical check size difference there. And what are some things you could potentially do to elevate that carry out ticket without compromising the value proposition to try to understand that potential impact your royalty revenue stream. Thanks so much.
Ritch Allison
Sure, sure, and, you know, the objective for us will be to grow both of those channels, you know, covid. Yeah, we donât we donât have all the data out of covid yet to understand to fully understand all of the customer behavior changes. But, you know, prior to covid, thereâs only about 15 percent of customers that were both delivery and carry out because customers tend to be one or the other. So as we look at the business going forward and think about how do we grow it in twenty, twenty one and beyond, it is going to be through a unique set of strategies around each of those two channels.
Unique set of strategies around each of those two channels. So while weâre certainly going to be aggressive on the carry outside with Dominos, car side delivery and other initiatives that we have in place, we absolutely are not stepping away from the delivery side of the business also. And weâve got a set of strategies that weâre going to continue to execute on the delivery side as well so that we could hold on to those customers that we that we that we gained during the course of twenty 20.
Stu Levy
Weâre not looking at it so much as a shift from one to the other as it is a reemergence or, you know, kind of gaining back some of those carry out customers that have been on the sideline. The most notable difference, obviously, from a ticket perspective is just the delivery fee.
Ritch Allison
And typically, itâs a little bit lower item count in those orders as well, but both channels very attractive and profitable businesses for our franchisees.
