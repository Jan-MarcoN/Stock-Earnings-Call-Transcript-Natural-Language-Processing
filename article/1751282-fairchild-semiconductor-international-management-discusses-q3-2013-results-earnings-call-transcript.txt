Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Fairchild Semiconductor Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Janson. Please go ahead, Sir.
Dan Janson
Good morning, and thank you for dialing in to Fairchild Semiconductor's Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. With me today is Mark Thompson, Fairchild's Chairman and CEO; and Mark Frey, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Let me begin by mentioning that we'll be attending the CrÃ©dit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on November 4 in Scottsdale, Arizona.
We'll start today's call with Mark Frey, who will review our third quarter financial results and discuss the current status of fourth quarter business. Mark Thompson will then discuss our product line results, end markets and operational performance in more detail. Finally, we'll reserve time for questions and answers.
This call is scheduled to last approximately 60 minutes and is being simultaneously webcast through the Investor Relations section of our website at fairchildsemi.com. The replay for this call will be publicly available for approximately 30 days.
Fairchild management will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call. These statements, including all statements about future results and performance, are made based on assumptions and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.
A discussion of these risk factors is provided in the quarterly and annual reports we file with the SEC. In addition, during this call, we may refer to adjusted or other financial measures that are not prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles. We use non-GAAP measures because we believe they provide useful information about the operating performance of our businesses that should be considered by investors in conjunction with GAAP measures that we also provide. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures at the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fairchildsemi.com. This website also contains a variety of useful information for investors, including an extensive financial section to facilitate your investment analysis.
Now I'll turn the discussion over to Mark Frey.
Mark S. Frey
Thanks, Dan. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm sure most of you have had a chance to review our earnings press release, so I'll focus on just the key points in my comments. We grew sales again in the third quarter while improving adjusted gross margin more than 2 points. R&D and SG&A spending were below the low end of our guidance range, and we expect to reduce these costs further in the fourth quarter and 2014. Let's review some of the details, starting with the income statement.
For the third quarter of 2013, Fairchild reported sales of $365 million, up 2% sequentially and also from the third quarter of 2012. As expected, our sales growth was due primarily to strong demand from one large mobile customer. Adjusted gross margin was 32%, up more than 2 points from the prior quarter due to higher factory loadings and lower manufacturing costs.
R&D and SG&A expenses came in below the end -- low end of our guidance at $95 million. The $3.4 million or 3% sequential decrease was due primarily to structural cost reductions, and we are guiding for further spending cuts in the fourth quarter.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $21 million and adjusted EPS was $0.17. The adjusted tax expense was a credit of nearly $1 million due to a favorable exchange rate impact through our Korean deferred tax asset.
Now I'd like to review our third quarter sales and gross margin performance for our 2 major product groups.
Sales were up 8% from the prior quarter for our MCCC business, driven by a significant increase in demand from one leading mobile customer. MCCC gross margin was up nearly 3 points from the prior quarter to 39% due to higher factory loadings in the prior quarter and lower manufacturing costs.
In our PCIA business, sales were down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by normal seasonal weakness, especially in the room air conditioner market. Gross margin improved to 30%, due primarily to the timing effect of higher production volumes in the prior quarter.
We began commercial production at our new 8-inch Korean fab in July and steadily ramped the volume during the quarter. As is typical for newly-opened facilities, the initial impact on our margins were slightly unfavorable. We expect that impact to turn positive in future quarters as we continue to ramp the operation.
Turning to our balance sheet. We increased internal inventory by $2 million or 1% sequentially to 88 days. The increase was due to higher stocking of raw materials required to ramp the production in the new fab in Korea, offset partially by a reduction in finished goods. We continue to maintain 1 of the leading supply chains in the industry. Days of sales outstanding, or DSOs, increased slightly to 43 days, while payables decreased to 37 days.
Free cash flow was $14 million for the third quarter, which included unfavorable changes in working capital. We ended the third quarter with total cash and securities exceeding our debt by $151 billion. We also paid off another $50 million in debt to reduce our total borrowings to $200 million, which is the lowest level on our history.
Turning now to forward guidance. We expect sales to be in the range of $335 million to $350 million for the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted gross margin to be 31% to 32%, due primarily to lower sales and factory loadings, as well as less favorable product mix. We anticipate R&D and SG&A spending to be $92 million to $94 million due to continued structural cost reductions. The adjusted tax rate is forecast at 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points for the quarter.
Consistent with our usual practices, we are not assuming any obligation to update this information, although we may choose to do so before we announce fourth quarter results.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark Thompson.
Mark S. Thompson
Thank you, Mark, and good morning. We delivered sequentially higher third quarter sales and margins, while spending less on operating expenses. As expected, our sales growth in Q3 were due primarily to strength from one large mobile customer. I'll begin with the detailed review of demand by end market. Given the current modest sales growth rate for the semiconductor industry, I also want to discuss how we plan to improve margins and earnings through increased operational efficiency and lower overhead spending. We believe we can significantly improve margins and profitability over the next 2 years from these efforts.
Finally, I'll review some current quarter results and operations metrics.
Turning to demand by end market. Total mobile sales increased slightly from the prior quarter due to stronger demand from one leading customer, partially offset by lower sales in the other mobile customers. Demand stabilized at a slightly lower level than the prior quarters at one of our other leading mobile customers. However, the mobile -- the booking trend indicates they will drain inventory in the fourth quarter, which will impact our Q4 sales. We saw incrementally weaker demand from some Asian tier 2 mobile customers, which also is incorporated in our fourth quarter guidance.
Demand for our innovative power conversion solutions that enable higher wattage battery chargers and reduce charging times continues to be very strong. Our rapid charge technology offers significant advantages over the competition, including proven performance, support for multiple communication protocols and best-in-class thermal performance. We expect solid sales growth from these products in 2014.
Sales of our products serving the Industrial and Appliance markets from Q3 held up well in what is typically a weak seasonal quarter. Sales of our highly integrated smart power modules that support the transition to variable speed motors in a wide variety of home appliances, industrial fans and pumps were seasonally lower.
Demand for IGBTs and high voltage MOSFETs was up slightly from the prior quarter due to continued strength from the industrial and solar inverter markets. We expect seasonally lower sales for this sector in Q4.
Our automotive business maintained its record sales level in Q3, despite what is normally a weak quarter seasonally. Demand for our leading edge drivetrain solution continues to grow, and we expect slightly higher sales for this business in the fourth quarter. Demand from the computing end market stabilized in what is seasonally a strong quarter. Gross margin has improved steadily in this business, as we benefit from a higher mix of server and high-end computing solutions, while we reduce exposure to consumer notebooks.
Sales for the consumer market was slightly lower sequentially, as weaker demand from the TV end market was partially offset by higher sales into the game station market. We expect sales into this sector to remain soft in the fourth quarter.
Putting it all together, we expect lower sales in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality and the year-end inventory reductions in the mobile end market. Looking beyond Q4, we expect modest, steady sales growth, driven by design wins and higher demand in mobile, industrial, appliance and automotive markets.
In this lower sales growth environment, we believe it is essential to accelerate margin and earnings improvement through greater operational efficiency and lower OpEx spending. Our new 8-inch fab in Korea that we began commercial production in last quarter will enable us to drive significant cost savings over the next few years. This fab is the linchpin of our plans to consolidate and streamline our front-end manufacturing. We will announce more on these plans later this quarter or early in the first quarter.
Greater utilization of this new fab and savings from consolidation are expected to result in tens of millions of dollars in annual savings beginning in 2014 and with full impact in 2015.
OpEx spending was down sequentially in the third quarter, and we forecast further reductions in Q4 and 2014. These are structural cost reductions that we believe are necessary to align our OpEx to the current environment. Combined, these programs include operational efficiency and lower OpEx, coupled with the leverage we get on modest sales growth, will drive solid improvement in margins and earnings over the next 2 years.
Turning now to Q3 results for our sales channels and our other operational performance. Distribution sell-through was up 1% to 2% sequentially. Our weeks of supply in the channel was roughly flat at 10 to 11 weeks. Sales into the OEM and EMS channels were up about 7%, due primarily to higher sales at one large mobile customer. Factory utilization decreased in Q3 as we brought on the new 8-inch fab in Korea. Lead times remained short for virtually all our businesses. Overall product pricing in Q3 was down about 1.5% from the prior quarter, and we expect similar performance in the fourth quarter.
Finally, I want to announce that we'll hold an Investor Day in mid-Q1, where we'll present details about our product strategy and plans to significantly improve our operational efficiency. We'll also provide a complete financial review, including a new target business model.
In closing, we reported solid third quarter results while making some important structural cost reductions in operating expenses. We expect seasonal lower demand in the fourth quarter, coupled with what appears to be the normal year-end inventory reduction for mobile. Our new 8-inch fab in Korea is ramping on schedule and will enable us to significantly improve our operational efficiency during the next 2 years. We'll have more details and an announcement to follow later this quarter or early next quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects further OpEx reductions, and we expect to keep a downward bias on overhead spending through 2014.
Thank you, and I'll turn the call back to Dan.
Dan Janson
Thanks, Mark. We'll now open the call to questions. I would ask that in order to allow more of you to ask questions, we limit each person to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Thanks, and let's take the first question, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Just a couple of questions on the cost management side of things, and I realize you're going to give more detail going forward. But if I start on the OpEx side of things, I -- good performance in the third quarter and going down in the fourth quarter. But if I look year-over-year or even year -- this year over 2 years ago, it seems like the fourth quarter has been weak in all 3 years, but the OpEx is actually up at the midpoint of your guidance, a good $6 million or $7 million. So can you just tell me how this year's cuts are structural when the last 2 years were more variable, given that this year is -- actually, the spending is still above the last 2?
Mark S. Frey
Well, particularly, for last year, Ross, when you're looking at Q3, there was a reversal of our variable compensation accrual in that where you had a kind of a one-time negative that's embedded in the number, and you had the same phenomenon in Q4, but at a slightly smaller number. And in the guidance and the performance so far this year, we still have variable compensation accruals on the books. So I guess there's kind of a misleader.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So why would you still have variable compensation on the books if -- are you hitting some targets this year that you weren't hitting in the prior years, I guess?
Mark S. Frey
We still are generating an EBIT level that's consistent with the low end of our variable compensation.
Mark S. Thompson
There are also cash flow metrics that pay out, Ross, that we expect to exceed.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So I guess, then, looking forward, the step-up that we've seen in years past won't occur because you're starting off of a higher base as we look into next year, barring whatever else that you're going to do on a structural basis.
Mark S. Frey
Yes. It will be less than normal. Now you give a normal $1.5 million to $2 million for moving into FICA tax withholding and the fact that people don't take vacations in the March quarter and they do in the December quarter. But then, we'll have further structural reductions to kind of offset that.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I guess as my follow-up then, can you, Mark Frey, just walk us through the gross margin side of things, mainly from the start-up cost point of view and how much of that is built into the third and fourth quarters of this year and, generally speaking, when you expect those to come out?
Mark S. Frey
Okay. Well, the start-up costs were kind of an ongoing negative $5 million to $6 million as we got ready to qualify the fab. Those expenses went away. But when you're running the fab at 10%, 20% utilization and when you turned on the $2 million to $2.5 million of depreciation, we actually -- we're about $1 million lower in Q3. I think, literally, as we ramp the fab up, that kind of negative number proceeds to become a tailwind, a positive number.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Is that a positive in the December quarter, or is it -- any sort of timing that you could help us with on that?
Mark S. Frey
It'll be better. I don't know if it'll turn positive.
Mark S. Thompson
So Ross, there are a lot of puts and takes on that, and that's probably why we've not tried to do, I guess I'd say, a casual job of quantifying it, but are still running a number of different scenarios that we'll be presenting people with, along with our new business model.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
I wonder if I could start with some commentary on the mobile segment, and I think I understood the commentary that you provided going forward into the fourth quarter. But you guys are coming off of a fairly weak second quarter. The third quarter growth wasn't all that strong, and I guess, according to my numbers, look like it's down double digits year-on-year. Perhaps you can give some more granularity to the sort of puts and takes on what happened in the third quarter, and what we should expect into the fourth quarter?
Mark S. Thompson
So if you take a look at the 2 largest mobile handset manufacturers, all -- both have had a pretty nasty [ph] year in terms of launching products and then announcing volume reductions. And again, I won't comment too much on their strategies. But if they seem to want to build a lot for product launches to make sure they're not short and then true up inventory later on once they understand what the true demand is, then we've seen that play out in sort of an alternating fashion between the 2 top handset players, and that's really been the story for the year. If you look at the fourth quarter, our expectation is that both of the top handset makers will be doing some amount of inventory reductions, and that's what's reflected in our -- and also why I commented, looking into next year, that we would expect them to be in some amount -- I mean, there certainly is net volume growth in the market. We would expect that then to result in some forward progress next year, although probably at a slower pace than past years, since I think most people are continuing to revise the volume forecast for smartphones, the growth rate downward. But we certainly expect that to be positive in 2014 after, as I've said, what has come to be a kind of a normal inventory true up in the fourth quarter.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Great. And just to clarify, could you clarify that the impact of those 2 top customers as a percentage of mobile business as compared to all else?
Mark S. Thompson
The sum of the top 2 is roughly equal to all the rest.
Christopher Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Right. Okay. And just a quick follow-up with regard to looking into next year and realizing that there's a lot of fixes and starts this year that the inventory in the channel segment that it really hasn't been replenished. How do you think -- and obviously, there's a lot of time between now and the beginning of next year. How do you think this sets up into next year, even with respect to normal seasonality?
Mark S. Thompson
So my expectations for the overall smartphone market is that it will grow at least some in 2014 relative to 2013. I will not attempt to call Google who will get share and who will donate share. But the aggregate position, we think, will go up. We expect our aggregate content to go up, primarily through increased proliferation of the high-powered charging, which is aimed at faster charge times for bigger -- ever bigger batteries as 4G and LTE systems continue to put really big demand on battery usage. And so exactly how that will play out quarter-by-quarter, the overlay between model launches and inventory corrections and overall market growth, yes, there's way too many scenarios to -- possible scenarios to try to create any and to make any sense. But aggregate up, content up and how to play out quarter-by-quarter, customer-by-customer, we'll just have to wait until get there to see.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Christopher Rolland with FBR.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
So when we're talking about mobile typical year-end inventory reductions, we know that one customer is notorious for this. But would you say that these year-end inventory reductions, that other customers are more intense than you've seen in years past, or is this about typical?
Mark S. Thompson
I would say it's typical. We don't have enough history in this space. I mean, the whole world doesn't have enough history. It's developed so quickly that there's really not a lot of historicals that you can create on; every year seems to be a little bit different. But it just doesn't seem to be outside any kind of normal range.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
Okay. And given the lower loadings for next quarter, I think we've roughly talked about some point in the future equipping the rest of the 8-inch fab out there and potential gross margin benefits there. But would you say with these lower loadings, does that sort of table that idea for the foreseeable future?
Mark S. Thompson
No. That's part of what we were talking about in terms of streamlining our footprint. We have today net of turning the 8-inch fab on, we've actually created a more fragmented footprint and more capacity. We have less efficient capacity in smaller increments in a number of different places that we intend to take offline. And so, that's -- to some extent, today is almost like the nadir of that. And then over the coming quarters, we will be taking that offline, then resulting in better utilization and better cost structure and better gross margin performance. And it's quantification of that by quarter that will be one of the most important embedded elements in the Investor Day that we'll do in the first quarter, and we're still really working through exactly the sequence that we want to do that. There's customer implications, there's lots of different things that have to be negotiated and sorted out. And so again, rather than -- we wanted to indicate clearly that we are going to do it. But rather than offer an array of possible scenarios, we'd like to offer a plan of record [ph] and track ourselves to that. And that's what we intend to offer in about a quarter's time.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Chris Danely with JPMorgan.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just going over the mobile market. Can you just run us through real quick the industrial consumer PC and auto end markets, which ones are up or down in Q3, and then which ones do you expect to be up or down in Q4? And I have a follow-up.
Mark S. Thompson
So let's see. Auto is sort of the simplest because it's been steadily up each quarter, and we expect -- it was up in the third quarter. We expect it to continue to be up slightly in the fourth quarter. If we look at the industrial solar inverter, it was up in the third quarter, probably flat in the fourth. Computing, we would expect to be on a continued downward trend for everything except for server. And if I look at the -- specifically the appliance, which for us is fairly heavily concentrated in air conditioning, it has a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with builds and starting again in the first. So it was down a bit in the third quarter. We expect it to be down another increment in the fourth quarter and then resume its upward growth in the first.
Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay, great. And for my follow-up, I guess, the other sort of problem end markets that you guys talked about in the press release were the CCTV and the tier 2 mobile markets in Asia. What's sort of your longer-term outlook on those end markets? Do you expect a recovery next year, or are we going to continue to have issues there?
Mark S. Thompson
Our expectation is that -- I mean, we have been -- if you look at the data that we provide on our segments at the Investor website, we've been steadily exiting the consumer electronics market. Its attractiveness continues to decline, and we've been systematically working our way out of that. We expect that to continue to occur. It's got some of the lowest margin, and I think, increasingly, will be some of the lowest growth. And so that piece will continue to be unattractive and, therefore, will be -- will continue to mitigate.
Operator
And we'll go next to Aashish Rao with Bank of America.
Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
For the third straight quarter, sales have been in line, or better yet, gross margins have missed. And I'm now looking at your fourth quarter guidance, and you're expecting sales down about 6%, but are only guiding gross margins down 60 basis points to 31.5%. The last time you were at $340 million to $345 million sales, gross margins were in the high 20's percent [ph]. So can you provide some color on what's driving this improvement versus 1 year, 1.5 year ago? It seems like total capacity is higher. And while there aren't any start-up cost, there are still under utilization and depreciation targets that are hitting you. So any color would be helpful.
Mark S. Frey
So I think there's 2 major things to talk about. We have made progress in manufacturing cost reductions. So we have seen improvements in, maybe not in the strategic areas but in yield, in scrappage, in productivity, headcount, et cetera. Our total heads are down about 200 people from last quarter, and so that's having a contribution. But the timing of the loading of the factories is not always synchronous with revenue. So if -- in Q2, we actually produced more than we did in Q3, but the impact of those loadings actually financially showed up in Q3. And we guided down a bit in Q4, and that's sort of a reflection with a 1 quarter lag of the production volumes we had in Q3. So you usually have a 1 quarter offset.
Aashish Rao - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Got it. Okay. Second question, just on the specifics of PCIA. And I'm trying to understand gross margins in this business, specifically. Here, compared to MCCC, sales were actually up about 4% year-to-date, yet gross margins are below. I mean, is this pricing or competition or reflecting just a capacity expansion in Korea? I mean, any color there?
Mark S. Thompson
Yes. So if you look at the commentary on the temporary impact of turning on the 8-inch line to gross margin. Today, the PCIA is 100% concentrated on the BK8. So the impact is disproportionately attributed to PCIA just because of accounting requirements. Now what will happen, obviously, is, therefore, it will -- 2 things you'll see in time. The first is that as we ramp that and consolidate it, we'll also disproportionately benefit PCIA, and so that will be a thing that will become visible in the not-too-distant future. The other one is, is that we are -- our BK8 facility is configured to support all of our MOSFET businesses, which includes 1/2 of MCCC. So you'll see that those 2 -- that distinction blurred over time as BK8 becomes a central resource.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from John Pitzer with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
John W. Pitzer - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Mark, appreciate the fact that there's not a lot of historical data to compare to. But I'm just kind of curious, I think you said the large handset customer that's going through normal inventories in the December quarter was also down sequentially, June to September. Did I hear that right? By how much? And given that they are down sequentially, if I'm right of what I heard, are you surprised that we're seeing a normal inventory correction. And I guess, any color, was the September quarter issues at the high end, and then the December quarter is more muted low end of their products suite? Any color there would be helpful.
Mark S. Thompson
Well, what we've seen across the year, John, is that you get a product launch, a build and then a true up of inventory, and we've seen that. So this year, one of them did it in the first half. Another one did it, and you probably saw an announcement from one of them earlier this week with something that was approximately a 20% volume reduction for the fourth quarter for their build rate, right? So it's been a saw-see pattern for the state [ph] and for both of the top players. And that's really been the mechanics as to why it's been pretty lumpy.
John W. Pitzer - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Perfect. And then guys, I guess, as a follow-up then, we're now kind of 3 quarters into the semiconductor upturn. That's been really a lot more seasonal-type growth than the normal cyclical growth you see. You guys are guiding to a December quarter that's kind of well below your seasonal pattern, albeit seasonality has a lot of variance, and now you're talking about structural cost cutting. Mark, I'm wondering if you could just help me understand, what's changed in your worldview? Is it just a differing slower growth view of the handset market? Does this bleed into other end markets that you participate in as your structural view of those end markets are fairly the same? And you made kind of a sobering comment about consumer and wanting to get out of consumer. I guess my question, do you -- why wouldn't the smartphone market start to look like the consumer market over the next 1 to 3 years?
Mark S. Frey
So let's see, a lot of very important elements to your questions. So let me try to address them one at a time. So the first is that our guidance is really not very far different than typical seasonal. So average Q3 to Q4 is down between 4% and 5%, and we're, say, 6%. So that's relatively in the noise. And we are factoring in a larger than average inventory -- customer inventory reduction for handsets, which may or may not come to pass, we'll see. So I think that there isn't anything abnormal in the guidance that we're putting out there.
Mark S. Thompson
Your question about the handset market is a good one, and I know everyone is trying to analyze where this thing is going. It's certainly -- there have been enormous fee changes in who buys silicon in the OEM world. It wasn't very many years ago that the PC was the dominant user of silicon, and that's inverted. And now the #1 procurer of silicon are the handset makers. There are significant structural differences between the way the handset makers operate and the way the PC market operates, that while it doesn't insulate it from commoditization, it makes commoditization forces much slower because, basically, there's not a single chipset provider that's hardwired to an operating system provider that basically eliminates degrees of freedom from the OEM. The OEMs control their architectures. And so what they've done over a period of time is deliver some pretty fantastic features in terms of display and content and everything else that really made this a dynamic market. And if you look at where it's headed, it's really headed towards being the link, personal link to kind of all other electronic stuff. Whether it's your display in your home or your car and so forth. So I don't think we're going to see the kind of growth over the next 3 to 5 years from that space that we've seen over the last 3 to 5 years, for sure. However, I think we're going to see a lot of really interesting innovation that's going to occur. And so while there will inevitably be some commodization, I don't think it's going to look like the PC market in the end. You've got, at least what, 5 chipset providers. It's a very different dynamic. Now, on the consumer electronics front, consumer electronics has an attractive space with a simple blip, has been in secular decline as an important user of silicon for a decade. If you look at DVD players, the CD players, et cetera, those kinds of things are very, very commoditized. Set-top boxes are highly commoditized. There was a brief blip in display technology. Now, everybody on the universe has a large flat panel display, and there's really nothing compelling to cause people to go replace those. And they're actually really reliable. People who bought them 7, 8, 9 years ago, they still work great. So I think those -- I wouldn't say we're exiting them, I'd say we're very selective. There are certain places like high efficiency power supplies, for example, some LED driving schemes that are interesting and attractive. But the overall content is less attractive. It certainly isn't growing. And so as a portion of our business, we've had it on a negative slope for 5 years. And we expect it to continue on a negative slope as we replace it with much stickier, more interesting stuff in automotive and industrial and so forth. I hope I captured your point, Shawn. If I missed one, please let me know.
John W. Pitzer - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
I'll also be at the Analyst Day. So I think there'd be a lively [ph] discussion there. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
It sounds like you're going to go into this in more detail in the future, but just with regard to sort of the eventual tailwind that you finished the 8 inch, would you expect the bulk of that tailwind to come more like a 2015 type of timeframe versus 2014?
Mark S. Frey
So our -- yes, we will say more about that in Q1. It would certainly be our intent to have some of that progress show itself in 2014. But until it does, you get some benefit winding down the facility, you get big benefit from closing a facility. And so the winding down part can start early; the closing normally takes a little while. And so that would certainly be our goal is to show steady, forward progress with a significant 1 or 2 increments of big progress, which certainly wouldn't take place until the first half of 2015.
Jonathan Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. And sorry to beat a dead horse on the handset stuff. So for the big customer that you're talking about for Q4 impacting you, I might have thought that there might have been a little bit less muted to normal given there was already a decent work down in Q3. Is it fair to say that Q3 work down did not meet with what was happening in Q4, or is that not the case?
Mark S. Frey
Well, there -- if you look at a lot of the build in Q3, so there was a slight -- an increase in demand due to a build in Q3, which is launched and introduced in Q4 and then tuned up. And so that's what -- that's my interpretation anyway of -- on these things even though they are our customers. We don't know any more than you do actually about their specific reasons for some of their changes and demand pattern.

And if I could sneak one last one in. Just on the computing, obviously, you've been committed to the high-end computing/server space. Is it the intention, though, that pretty much the notebook, desktop set [ph] pretty much goes away completely.
Mark S. Frey
It pretty much has gone away. So we have very low single-digit exposure to the notebook.

We'll take our next question from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
On the mobile space, you said tier 2 was also lower. Can you give any more granularity on what's happening there?
Mark S. Frey
Probably not, because I'm not sure I understand it yet. So there's been -- there was, there seems to be -- but tier 2 is basically 2 increments. There's the fading Western company and there's the emerging Chinese companies. And so there was clearly some reductions that occurred there, or rather, growth that didn't occur in that. So exactly how that's going to play out? My expectation is that the fading Western ones will continue to fade, in some cases disappear. I think we'll see some consolidation and the emergence of growth, for sure, from a handful of the Chinese -- a couple of increasingly well-known names in there that we will -- we will see growth from. So why there was some weakness there, I'm not sure I understand yet.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Okay, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, it seems the end market for the handsets, prices are coming down. Are you feeling any price pressure from these customers?
Mark S. Frey
Well, there's always intense price pressures from these folks. They're the best in the game, and they don't take prices casually and always want to make as much profit as they possibly can. I think it's certainly going to be the case that there's going to be less silicon in some of the B [ph] contents at smartphones. However, from -- so I think you'll see economizing on memory, you'll see economizing on processing power, some things like that. The data rate, loading of the battery and battery management, battery charge management will really be a constant across that. So aside from the fact that it's such a great fit to our strategy and capabilities, it's one of the things that makes that layer extremely attractive is that even with intense pressure on pricing for the handset, that technology hasn't been sorted out. And it's not that big a dollar content of the total. And so I think it will be more robust for a longer period of time than some of the other categories.
Kevin E. Cassidy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division
Okay. And if I could just -- maybe if you could remind us what your pricing contracts, does it go handset by handset, or is an annual contract or a mixture of both?
Mark S. Frey
So typically, large OEMs do a couple of time a year negotiation. And then for the duration of that contract, the prices are what the prices are agreed to.
Mark S. Thompson
One of the customers doesn't have a whole lot of different handsets, and so it effectively becomes the same thing.
Mark S. Frey
Yes, it's singular.

We'll take our next question from Shawn Harrison with Longbow.
Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC
I just want to clarify a few things on my end. So if we look at cost of goods sold in reductions and what's been articulated so far, what's already occurring in the 8-inch fab? But any new reductions we really want to see any benefit during 2014 is kind of what I'm getting at, then we would see it more in 2015. Is that the correct way to view kind of what would come up this first quarter '14 Analyst Day?
Mark S. Thompson
I would say we would see gradual progress on the basic cost, ongoing measures that we've been taking through 2014, depending on the level of sales, obviously. If growth is a bit higher than the next tailwind to gross margins, this continuous improvements would be in early 2015 where we cut out whole fixed cost structures from the systems.
Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. And then on the R&D side, if I look at it right now, that kind of SG&A, you're in the $20 million annualized run rate of savings versus kind of where you were coming into the second half of the year. Is there -- is that a number that can double in 2014? Just any way to triangulate that. And I know I don't want to get too far ahead of what you'd like to talk about in the first quarter, but any way to triangulate that will be helpful.
Mark S. Thompson
Exactly the how it will play across the year, we still haven't -- we're still analyzing a lot of that. So the OpEx -- OpEx quantification shifts into the same category as the footprint consolidation as we're still working through different plans. So we've taken the first couple of whacks at it, of things that we knew we wanted to do. And so we went ahead and did them. We're continuing to analyze certain things. But I think what you could say is, starting from where we are today, we have continued to reduce -- I do not expect that I can say that it won't, in 2014, go below $90 million a quarter. So that can kind of range how we anticipate ramping it.
Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC
And then with just 1 final follow-up question. The inventory adjustments you're seeing in the smartphone side, is that across kind of all models you deal with? Is it certain ranges in the market where you're seeing more pressure for inventory reductions in terms of phone types?
Mark S. Frey
We don't know. We don't actually have visibility into that. So as Mark said, there's -- of the 2 top players, one has a very simple and [indiscernible], the other has a much more complicated sample. But when somebody buys an adapter, controller from us, for example, they don't tell us what they're going to do with it. So that's why we don't really have a lot of visibility into that.

And we'll go next to Ada Menaker from MKM Partners.
Ada Menaker - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division
Can you provide some additional color on automotive and industrial? It does sound like the healthiest end markets right now. How do they seem going to 2014 in terms of your content and end demand?
Mark S. Thompson
Sure. Those markets do tend to be steadier. They go up slower and they go down slower and they're much more granular. So they do tend to be steadier. We've had, in both places, long-term R&D programs that have addressed some very fundamental capabilities. So if I use automotive as an example, we have a very dedicated strategy to help electrify the vehicle. And when I say that, I don't mean make parts of electric vehicle, but things like direct injection, single coil per cylinder are actually proliferation of content versus the old manifold injection and distributor coil arrangements. If you follow that along, removal of mechanical parasitic, for example, conversion from hydraulic power steering to electric power steering, each of those transitions has dollars and dollars of content for us. We have unique capabilities to do them and benefit provided to the OEM is that they have equal or lower build [ph] material cost that they get fuel economy benefits from it. So whether it's the U.S. versus specific fuel economy standards or European requirement for reduced CO2 per mile, those -- we have very compelling technological solutions that go into those. And they do go up slowly because car platforms are very slow to develop, they're very slow to ramp. And so it's been a nice steady process where we continue to gain share first in Europe and then now in the U.S. and then the next wave will be with the Korean makers. So that kind of steady progress is the one that we've shown in automotive. So we've a little more than doubled it over 5 years. We think that that growth rate will, at least, continue and potentially accelerate. So that's the picture of what we've been doing. There are similar kinds of things on the industrial side. So if you look, for example, at an inverter solutions for solar, there's been a lot of engineering that's gone into that. We have very compelling high-efficiency solution. And the economics of solar are intensely sensitive to efficiency because of such a borderline economic proposition anyway. But again, it's really being driven by government regulations. And similarly on the appliance side, there you have driving toward having high-efficiency appliances that we have really unique capabilities to allow the OEMs to convert from AC motors to Brushless DC. Same kind of picture of slow evolutions driven by efficiency requirement that we have unique solutions to those. So it's really at the center of the kinds of solutions that we want to form that piece of the company around and really why we created PCIA in the first place.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
On the structural cost reduction, can you give a little more color in terms of some of the things you guys think you can achieve there? And then are there any concerns in terms of your taking these actions? What are the implications for the longer-term growth outlook of the company?
Mark S. Frey
Okay, so I'll address that SG&A and Mark will talk about R&D because we are looking at both areas. For SG&A, as you can see, we've actually been throughout this kind of extended down-up cycle been working on our cost structure. So it's actually been coming down over time. I think we'll just continue those programs. We tend to challenge over time the managers in those groups to, as they look into a coming year, to fund their own merit increases across the group and still take gross spending out of 2% to 4% of the growth. And that system has worked pretty well going forward. We would look to try to take that as a total category spending to about 13% to 13.5% of revenue.
Mark S. Thompson
And so let me try to offer just a couple of examples from the R&D side and why we're being a little bit slow to quantify it because if you have to do your homework very carefully, and basically, give up the inefficiencies for things that you think won't pay off, but not give up the important good stuff. So if I take a couple of places, I'll start with an example that we've made sacred in this. So we expect to launch a best-in-class sensor solution for all manner of mobile applications that we think, and based on some of our customer feedback, really is a whole new class of capability in ultralow power, high definition sensor solutions. We've increased our spend in that, and we'll continue to keep our foot down on that because we think that that's going to be a very important piece of business for us. If you look at the other, we have taken significantly our spend out of mobile on some interface solutions where the next wave of things like highly integrated interface chips, we think is relevant only for the very high-end smartphone and we think that's not where the growth is going to be. And so we've basically taken that spend out where we've concentrated our spend. So we have reduced overall spend in mobile, but highly concentrated it in places like battery charging, battery management, and so forth. There's also some very interesting lighting solutions for problems that haven't been solved. So there's a series of things like that. So it's really looking hard at things that are likely to commoditize more slowly, where we have unique capability, and concentrating our resources there. So we're going through that a layer at a time. And one other one is, historically, we've run our high voltage and our low-voltage MOSFET businesses independently, different fabs, different process engineering. What we've seen over time is that those 2 things are growing together. It used to be power supplies and board level DC:DC stuff. There's increasing amounts of stuff that's in a voltage shares technology. So we're consolidating all of our process engineering, basically to have one family of process engineering that will reach across from low voltage to high voltage. We think there's significant efficiencies we can gain from that. And those will all be going through a single fab anyway. So a good opportunity to do that. So it sort of a layer at a time, we see the opportunities to concentrate, to put debt bigger on fewer things and to be more efficient. And that's really what's driving our choices. It's not an equal nick at everything. I really don't -- I think that's really a bad way to do it, and we're not doing it that way.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
And for my follow-up, you made a comment that the balance sheet is in the best position that it's ever been. What are the thoughts around that heading into next year in terms of things you might do from a catalog occasion perspective?
Mark S. Frey
So as we look into next year, having completed the Korean fab insulation, we see our capital needs less than $90 million annually. So looking forward, we're confident about good, steady cash flow generation. Obviously, investment opportunities will get the first priority. But from an organic standpoint, we don't see large needs because we'll be balancing fabless and sub-con capacity with additions to our own capacity. We're still a little cautious about acquisitions, although I think there are some good opportunities there. It is not our approach to "keep dry powder" for those things. If they make sense, we will be able finance them. We have stated in the past that once our net cash position reaches $250 million, we would be inclined to turn on this dividend. And I think that's sort of the, what we're focusing in on much more intensely, and we'll probably talk about that in more detail in the investor conference in the first quarter. But I think it is highly likely that we will cross that $250 million threshold in 2014. So we have said, we all addressed that specifically as we get close to that and we plan to in 2014.

Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division
For the sequential drop in 4Q, would you think that the vast majority of that, are we to believe, is mobile than the vast, vast majority and perhaps you can remind us what typical PCIA seasonality looks like in 4Q and you guys think you're tracking versus seasonality?
Mark S. Thompson
The biggest chunk is mobile, for sure. If you look at it, there's small down increments in, particularly, air conditioning and PCIA, flat to up in a few segments of industrial and flat to up in automotive.
