Good morning, and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO; and Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of our discussions may contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represent management's belief and assumptions concerning future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainty and assumptions that are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors. Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Robert O. Carr
Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland. Let me provide some perspective on our third quarter results. We had another record quarter with adjusted net income of $24.8 million or $0.68 per share. From an adjusted EPS perspective, this was the most profitable quarter in the company's history.
In a minute, Samir will take you through all of the numbers, but from my perspective, this was another solid quarter of accelerating growth that further demonstrates not only the strength of the organization across a number of dimensions, but also that we have established sustainable momentum.
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were beginning a period of steady improvement in the rate of growth for both card transaction volume and net revenue. The backlog of new business that we have been building over the past few quarters has begun to flow through merchant volume, and consequently, card revenues.
Another solid performance last quarter, card volume growth accelerated even further this quarter, led by yet another quarter of record new margin installed, diligence in our customer retention efforts and stable same-store sales. Card net revenue growth also accelerated from last quarter, and as Samir will discuss, we expect that growth rate to pick up considerably beginning in the fourth quarter.
The third quarter marked our eighth consecutive quarter of new business growth. In fact, we set a monthly record for new margin installed in September. Driven by the momentum that has been gathering over the year, card transaction processing volume growth topped 9% in September and it looks like October will be a likewise solid month from a card volume growth perspective.
Our non-card business has delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth, which is almost 31% for the quarter, both through organic growth as well as through strategic acquisitions. On this front, we closed the TouchNet acquisition and expect it to perform in line with our expectations. We purchased the remaining portion of Leaf that we did not already own and Leaf will form a critical component of our POS strategy.
Today, we are pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Xpient Solutions. Xpient is primarily a point-of-sale software solutions provider for the food service industry. Applebee's, Panera, Taco Bell, Arby's, Wendy's and IHOP are some of the hospitality franchises that rely on Xpient for their point-of-sale solutions or related products, including back office and enterprise management. From applications that help efficiently take orders to kitchen display systems to labor management, inventory control, customer loyalty and data management, Xpient's suite of solutions allows restaurant operators to better and more easily manage every aspect of their business, especially in helping kitchen throughput in the busiest of times such as lunch and dinner as well as taking mobile order reservations, wait management and reservations as well as pay at the table.
Overall, we are pleased with our ability to acquire and effectively integrate companies that propel our strategy, help our customers and assist us in achieving our goals.
Results once again also reflect the strength of our sales organization. In the quarter, we added a net 68 new relationship managers, one of the best quarters of new RM addition in some time. Achieving that growth in our field sales force, while maintaining near record productivity, represents a critical element in achieving our overall growth goals. And we continue to provide these relationship managers with an ever-increasing array of very innovative new products.
Xpient is only the latest example. Their POS technology is another area where our core payments capability is being naturally extended into a complementary market that we believe offers exciting growth opportunities. While Xpient's platform will remain open to other processors, experience has shown that most merchants prefer to have a single business solutions provider, including payments processing, and have the same fully integrated into point-of-sale. For instance, Xpient, Leaf and our Heartland Secure solution offer merchants a secure platform to manage their businesses, process payments and enable other business applications all from the same provider. For Heartland, delivering a value-added, integrated solution to our customers is a solid value proposition and the POS component brings us closer to our customers.
Xpient creates a number of interesting opportunities at a time when an increasing number of high-profile breaches are casting a shadow across the integrated POS industry. Because many of the current integrated POS platforms increase breach risk, exposure of card data, large and midsized and smart -- small merchants are now becoming increasingly interested in completing -- completely separating card processing data from the POS system. They want to go out of scope for PCI whenever possible and that is right in the sweet spot of Heartland. While Xpient will strengthen our position, merchant interest in E3 and Heartland Secure has already started to heat up. Now we think interest will really take off.
Xpient will represent further progress in our journey to enhance the value we can offer merchants and strengthen client relationships. The acquisition of Xpient, like TouchNet and others before it, will complement our basic card processing capabilities while creating opportunities to enhance our overall growth.
Our goal is to leverage our core strengths to continually move up the value chain and develop innovative solutions around our core payments capability, especially in areas of high strategic value such as business operations.
This quarter, we surpassed a number of important milestones that I believe clearly indicate that the decisions and investments we have been making over the past couple of years are preparing Heartland for a period of sustained outstanding performance. The continued growth of new business, the corresponding increase in card volumes, a strong and vibrant sales organization, heightened interest in our industry-leading security focus and the acquisition of complementary capabilities that provide synergistic advantages are all combined to create strong momentum that we believe offer opportunities to accelerate our growth over the next year.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Samir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Bob. Let me turn our attention back to the results for this quarter. For the third quarter, adjusted net income was $24.8 million or a record of $0.68 per share compared to $25.1 million or $0.66 per share for the third quarter of last year. We reported third quarter GAAP net income of $20.5 million or $0.56 per share. Adjusted results reflect $0.06 per share for each of acquisition-related amortizations and share-based compensation.
Overall, our net revenue grew 10.5% during the quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. With this growth, we delivered record net revenue of $169.4 million for the quarter. Card processing net revenue was up 4.1%, driven by solid increase in processing volume while the 10.7% increase in total processing volume benefited from AmEx's new OptBlue program. The increase in reported AmEx volume was not accompanied by revenue growth during the quarter due to the nature and timing of the conversion. We do expect faster card revenue growth in coming quarters. Excluding the impact of AmEx's OptBlue program, our volume increased by 7.1% for the quarter. This represented a solid acceleration from 5.4% in the second quarter and 3.5% in the first quarter of this year. This performance is consistent with the gathering momentum from our growth in new margin installed and increasingly successful merchant retention programs.
Same-store sales growth remains in line with our expectations.
Indeed, we expect to continue this trend given the overall momentum and key drivers of revenue and as evidenced by the very strong volume growth achieved in September and October of this year.
Our non-card processing net revenue growth also accelerated in the quarter, increasing 30.5% over the same period a year ago and accounting for approximately 29% of total net revenue. Acquisitions contributed approximately $6 million of non-card revenue to the quarter, including $4 million related to TouchNet from the date it closed on September 4. TouchNet's revenue is included in our Campus business. Collectively, non-card revenue will continue to grow at double-digit rates, consistent with the solid performance exhibited in the past.
Operating margin for the quarter was 18% compared to 22.8% for the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of Leaf's operating losses, operating margin during the quarter was 19.6%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was 22% compared to 25.9% a year ago.
Let me make a few comments regarding our margins. We incurred expenses during the quarter related to transaction costs and increased amortization as a result of these transactions. During the quarter, we incurred $1.7 million of deal-related costs plus 1 month of TouchNet's approximately $2 million to $2.5 million of quarterly amortization.
The second factor is OptBlue. While OptBlue is a much better program for Heartland, conversion of customers is key. In the third quarter, we focused on such conversions, including providing our RMs with added incentive compensation. As a result, while we achieved our conversion objectives, the start of the financial benefit was pushed in the fourth quarter. This impacted our third quarter margins. However, we expect margins to be positively impacted as the revenue benefit is recognized in the fourth quarter.
Our operating results include Leaf losses for the quarter, which, as mentioned previously, caused a 160 basis point reduction in our margins. As part of the acquisition of the remaining entries of Leaf, we booked a onetime gain of $3.6 million, which was related to an earnout payment to the minority shareholders that will not be paid.
The increase in interest expense reflected the higher debt levels corresponding with the closing of the TouchNet acquisition. As of September 30, total borrowings were $572.5 million, including our new $375 million term loan used to fund TouchNet.
Cash flow remained strong in the third quarter with management's measure of operating cash flow totaling $36.8 million and free cash flow generated of $23.6 million. Year-to-date, management's measure of operating cash flow was up 3% to $105 million and free cash flow generated rose to $65.9 million. Clearly, we are generating cash at levels that support our growth and capital deployment objectives.
As mentioned previously, we expect capital expenditures for the year to be in line with last year's level, which was approximately $50 million.
Now to wrap with our guidance. For the full year 2014, we expect net revenue to grow 11% to 12% to be between approximately $665 million and $670 million and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.33 to $2.37. Guidance assumes that after-tax share-based compensation and acquisition-related amortization expenses reduce earnings per share by $0.46 for the year and an effective tax rate above 39%. Guidance for the year reflects a reduction of $0.19 per share for Leaf's operating losses excluding the positive impact related to the onetime gain described above. Finally, the guidance includes the contribution from the acquisition of TouchNet in 2014, which, net of associated transaction costs, is expected to be slightly accretive on an adjusted basis.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Bob for a few concluding remarks.
Robert O. Carr
Thank you, Samir. Before closing today's call and opening it up for questions, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share payable December 15, 2014, to shareholders of record on November 24, 2014.
And finally, as always, I would like to thank all of the great Heartland team members for making these very powerful results so positive. We are now ready to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
First, with respect to TouchNet, I was wondering if you could clarify whether the contribution you expect in Q4 is above that $4 million run rate you saw on a monthly basis for Q3, so do you expect above $12 million contribution. And what's the incremental OpEx associated with TouchNet in particular?
Samir Zabaneh
So when you think of TouchNet, we said, on an annual basis, revenue will be $60 million next year. So that's what we said about TouchNet. And for this year, $4 million, you could increase it a little bit for the Q4, but it will be in line with that number, between the $12 million and the $15 million.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And the OpEx?
Samir Zabaneh
So we're not disclosing OpEx for TouchNet separately. We said the operating margin for TouchNet will be around 30%. But recall, this year, as I mentioned, it will be marginally accretive because of the depreciation related to the acquisition as well as the deal expenses.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, the new relationship managers were up a lot in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about how that increase in RMs is likely to flow through to the new margins installed? And kind of what you expect it -- expectations in terms of the speed of that flow-through over the next few quarters?
Robert O. Carr
I think the last couple of quarters are good indications of what's to come in terms of -- on a percentage basis. We're picking up good interest in people in the industry wanting to come to Heartland and we're -- our productivity is staying very consistent, going up a little bit. So I think we're on a trend that's sustainable.
Samir Zabaneh
We actually feel that the target that we made earlier this year of increasing the number of RMs by 135, we are on target. We've had great momentum recently. And the way to think about it, James, is the installed margin is a function of the productivity and the number of RMs, including the SPAs, and that has been working very well. So productivity, as Bob mentioned, is at an all-time high and we believe that the new RMs this year are producing better than the new RMs last year. So the productivity should remain high.
Operator
Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
A couple of questions. I apologize if I missed some opening comments, but could you just talk about the payroll? I know you've mentioned in prior quarters around the size and sort of an enhanced focus on that business. Just curious for any update through this quarter just how you might be thinking about it over the next 1 to 2 years, whether you're more optimistic or sort of where you were a quarter ago about the likelihood of seeing a real takeoff there?
Robert O. Carr
Well, we're in a prime selling season for payroll right now and it's going very well. We're jazzed about our payroll business. We think we're in a very nice position. We've been able to attract a lot of really good experienced salespeople in payroll and so we're -- the short answer is we're very positive about payroll.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
If I could just ask 2 others, one, sort of tying back into this. So you're obviously moving more to like a broader business services platform for some key verticals like restaurants, what have you. Is there anything that you currently possess around like bookkeeping and accounting. I can't remember if you've signed any partnerships or developed anything around that part of business management. If you could just -- any comments there or thoughts around that kind of offering.
Robert O. Carr
Yes, we haven't announced anything because nothing is material, but we do integrate to a couple of accounting firms. Of course, we integrate to QuickBooks. And with Xpient, we're going to be able to integrate to all the major accounting systems that large restaurant chains use. We haven't really been selling it proactively because we haven't figured out how to scale it profitably, but we've been working on that, actually, for a number of years. We've tried a couple of things that didn't work. The things that we have -- doing right now are working, but again, we have to prove that we can scale it up.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then the last one I had was just around loyalty, and I guess, maybe tying it into mobile payments a little bit. I think this week, Taco Bell announced an order-ahead, pay-ahead app. You mentioned that they're a customer of Xpient. Just broadly speaking, I mean, what's the appetite around the small and midsized businesses for mobile-based loyalty and maybe incorporating the order-ahead, pay-ahead kind of stuff that clearly names like Starbucks and others have seen great success with? Are you seeing heightened levels of interest from smaller guys that want to have that for a customer base? Any thoughts there?
Robert O. Carr
We have lots of thoughts about that and thank you for that question. Heartland has gone out -- I want to put this in perspective. Years ago, before we had a platform, we took the best of what the large merchants have, which was Interchange Plus pricing and we brought it down to the smaller merchant. And then in '08, we purchased the Alliance Data Systems' petro business, which had large petro, and we've been able to bring that down to the smaller merchants. And then with this -- with the acquisition of Xpient, which is the premier large restaurant chain QSR platform, we believe we can take their product and bring it down-market to the smaller restaurant operators. And the smaller operators want to have the same capabilities as our great customer, Taco Bell, who does have a very successful rollout, and we're very proud to be part of that as well as a number of others. There's a large interest -- the smaller merchants are not able, with loyalty programs, to invest in the marketing that goes with making those programs successful, so they haven't taken off as well as we'd all like. But I think with better tools and more experience, that we're going to be able to be effective with the smaller merchants. So there's a tremendous, tremendous amount of interest. This -- the ability to get from here to there has been difficult, but I think we're breaking through that now and we're going to see a lot of success with it. But frankly, the real driver right now is getting merchants out of scope with PCI. These breaches have just got almost everybody's attention and merchants are looking to get out of scope, so that they don't get breached.
Operator
Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
A couple of things, I guess. First, just looking at the net revenue yield. It seems to have come down a bit this quarter. I'm wondering how much of that is OptBlue versus anything else that might be influencing that measure?
Samir Zabaneh
So I would say OptBlue had a good contribution to the reduction in rates right now, but it doesn't account for the whole decline. You will see a rebound in the net revenue rates next quarter when the full revenue benefit of the conversion occur. The other elements that -- as we mentioned in the past, we continue to move into the larger customers that typically have slightly lower prices. So there's 2 components for this. I would say OptBlue made -- did make a material contribution to this.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. So it's timing to some degree?
Samir Zabaneh
It's absolutely just timing.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And Bob Carr, you make a really interesting comment around SMBs, and focus on data and data security and getting out of scope. Can you talk about a little bit Heartland's EMV positioning and certifications perhaps versus some of the sort of next-gen point-of-sale systems in the market, the ISVs and so forth? Is there -- do you think there's a competitive advantage for Heartland around the architecture of your technology and the way you go to market and those types of factors that could allow you to take some share as EMV really comes into focus next year?
Robert O. Carr
I appreciate that question because I think we are really nicely positioned. Heartland Secure is the brand that we've established for our security product, which includes E3. E3, of course, is End-to-End Encryption that we brought to market with Voltage 5 years ago. We've added EMV capability. We've implemented that and we also have full scale tokenization to go with it. So we feel like we have the most complete solution out there. We're not the only ones that have that, but we have ours working. We were able to process Apple Pay with our product at the Giants stadium for the World Series. We were able to set up the MasterCard cafeterias in St. Louis and purchase, along with our Xpient who at the time was our partner and now it's our company. So we, I think, are in a very strong position. We can take a merchant out of scope. We don't have to charge an extra transaction fee. What's happened over the years is the -- which I won't get into a whole lot, but the opportunity to provide security solutions is -- it's a software product that many in our industry have taken as an opportunity, as good capitalists, to charge a transaction fee for. And good for them, but we don't need to charge a transaction fee because we feel like we can make a good margin with our current transaction fees, maybe a little bit more to cover the overhead of developing and amortizing the security solutions. But right now we're going head-on with some of the other players out there without a transaction fee and with arguably the most complete product out there.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
And if I could just add in. An interesting issue that the industry faces over EMV is being able to get all the certifications done and the ground zero for that is people with the integrated platforms. If you run the payments information all through the platform, Bob was talking earlier about out of scope, and ironically, what that involves is pulling the payment data out of the integrated processing with all the other kitchen management and other processes that are run with these systems. And so ironically, EMV, because the certification process is going to be a challenge, the card networks are trying to figure out ways to make it easier, but there's going to be a lot of people waiting in line. That could actually push these -- the separation, which is ultimately an easier implementation and certification process than certifying something through a whole system. So it's pretty complicated. We all have a lot of work to do on EMV to roll it out as successfully as we want to. But we think we're in a great position to help merchants do that.
Operator
Your next question is from Dave Koning of Baird.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
I guess, first of all, on Leaf, I think you said, overall, the total impact to Q3 was a $0.05 favorable impact. And just trying to disaggregate the pieces because it looks like the gain -- the nonrecurring gain was maybe $0.06 after-tax, so does that mean it only lost $0.01 of operating to net to $0.05? I just want to -- maybe there's a tax implication. Maybe you can just disaggregate the pieces for us.
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. There is no tax implication for the gain that we actually booked. So you would have to take the entire gain divided by the number of shares to actually calculate it.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. So it's a $0.10, really nontaxable gain, and then $0.05 of operating losses?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Was there any reason -- I mean, was this already factored into guidance? I mean, usually onetime items you guys have taken out of result. I'm just wondering maybe why you decided to leave that one in.
Samir Zabaneh
So for the guidance of Leaf, that is actually excluded. And also the guidance for the overall company, that's also excluded. So we don't -- we do not have that in.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay, so in -- so the $0.68 reported number includes the $0.10 benefit, but the $2.33 to $2.37 full year guidance excludes the benefit? Just so we...
Samir Zabaneh
Yes, yes.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay, okay. And then finally, now that you've acquired Leaf and it's fully in your numbers, just trying to understand was your last quarter guidance around Leaf like about the same as what it is now? I know that the numbers, the way the structure has changed so I'm just wondering if your expectations around Leaf have really changed or not since last quarter.
Samir Zabaneh
The long-term expectation of Leaf is still the same. During this quarter, we made further investment in the product development and that's why you see we've increased the $0.17 to the $0.19. But overall, our long-term vision, our long-term strategy with respect to Leaf has not really changed.
Operator
Our next question is from Smitty Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley.
Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I had a follow-up question on the Xpient acquisition. Can you talk about the potential synergies in terms of being able to sell more Leaf tablets into the restaurant industry now that you have Xpient? And can you also talk about who Xpient primarily competes with today? And if there's any potential channel conflicts that could potentially arise from this acquisition?
Robert O. Carr
Yes, the competitors for Xpient are the large POS companies in the business, now NCR and Oracle, formerly Aloha and MICROS. In terms of -- there's many other, probably 20 other point-of-sale companies in the business that compete as well, but Xpient tends to have the large merchants that need enterprise solutions. And what we really like, and this has been our strategy for some time, is the idea that we can take some of these enterprise functions and bring them down into the smaller restaurants and if they can be functional on the Leaf tablets or other off-the-shelf tablets as well. And for example, our online ordering is becoming a very -- an important part of the ecosystem and it's going to become more important. And one of the things that Xpient does, is they manage the orders during busy times. So when breakfast, when everybody wants coffee and at lunchtime when everybody wants lunch, they're able to take the orders in and tell the consumer, hey, I can't give you your lunch at 12:00, come in at 12:07. And that type of thing, the smaller merchants need. They might not have 100 locations, but they need it at their one location and that's one -- just one example of many, many examples of what the technology that the smaller merchants need that the larger merchants have right now and we're really excited about bringing that into the small restaurant market.
Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. And maybe just a follow-up question on the cross-selling front. Can you give us an update in terms of what product is doing better than expected? And what products are performing below your expectations?
Robert O. Carr
Not really.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
I just threw out a comment that selling per se is not something we drive our sales force to do. We try to offer them a suite of products that are great -- that are individually great and we obviously -- they have their own incentive to lock in a customer by selling a second product, but we don't say to someone "you have to sell a certain amount of payroll," for example. We want them to, we encourage them to, we think it's got an attractive offering and they need to make money. And so that we have -- our incentives are aligned. But there isn't any formal cross-selling. We're actually starting some efforts around outbound telemarketing to do some cross-selling, but that's really very early days. And so we really don't track a lot of that stuff right now.
Robert O. Carr
And it's not that difficult. We've been in the payroll business since 1999, so it's not a new business to us. And we've tried a lot of things. They haven't worked really great. And when you threw the -- used the term cross-selling, that sort of threw me a little bit because we don't do a great job in cross-selling, but we're doing a good job now of multiple product selling and they're not the same thing. And the differentiator is we have these specialists in payroll around the country and they work with the local relationship managers. So the local relationship managers don't have to be payroll experts because they have somebody that they can refer the business to. So the salespeople can sell a small, easy payroll. And when it gets complicated, they bring in the expert, the SPA, and so we've been successful selling multiple products and I think that model's going to work for us, but that's not exactly the same as cross-selling.
Operator
Our next question comes from...
Robert O. Carr
I'm sorry. I probably made that more complicated than I needed to, but that's the explanation, sorry.
Samir Zabaneh
But maybe I could add just one more point to that. One, we don't break down the installed margin by the product. And our overall installed margin has been increasing. We see payroll partly because of the -- mainly because of the SPA model that we have introduced to become sort of a bigger portion as part of installed margin compared to what it was before. So that would be the one product that's really gaining momentum, but we do have other products that continue to do well within the installed margin.
Operator
Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask you about the 7.1% transaction processing volume growth for your SME business. Is there an inorganic contribution there?
Samir Zabaneh
No.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
That's all organic?
Samir Zabaneh
That is all organic.
Ramsey El-Assal - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Okay, that's great. And forgive me if you've commented on this earlier. Of the 68 relationship managers that you added net in the quarter, I guess, at this point, can you give us some comments? Sort of how stable is your sales headcount at this point? Are you satisfied with the size and structure of your sales organization? Should we expect to see that sort of taper off? Or are there incremental additions that you're contemplating?
Robert O. Carr
We are absolutely contemplating growing the sales organization because we have so many more products and a sales rep can't handle as big a territory. We don't have territories for our sales people, but we've gone from being a one-trick pony back in the '90s to having a really full suite of products and we don't have enough salespeople out there. And we don't expect to double it overnight, but we do expect to grow the sales organization to be a considerably larger organization over time and the pace that we're growing it feels pretty comfortable right now.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
And to achieve the 135 goal that we set at the end of the year that Samir reiterated implies a nice growth rate in the fourth quarter as well of net adds. And this is going to have some ebbs and flows. There will be times or quarters when more people leave. It's a tough business and we try to make it as easy as we can for people, but it's still a tough business, so people will leave. But overall, we feel very good that the third quarter was our best quarter in a long, long time in terms of hiring rate, well ahead of where -- the hiring rate that we had in the first and second quarters, and we feel good about that. And obviously, we held on to a good number of people this quarter with a net gain of 68.
Operator
Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.
Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Sorry if I missed this. With Xpient, did you give the revenue and margin run rate for that business? How is it distributed today primarily? And is it -- I mean, what's the revenue model look like? Is it primarily hardware or is there a good maintenance stream attached to it?
Samir Zabaneh
We did not give any information yet with respect to Xpient, but I will -- but I'm happy to actually tell you. So it is a software model and they do have both sides being a perpetual license as well as a SaaS type of revenue.
Robert O. Carr
Yes. Xpient is hardware-agnostic. As long as the hardware is up to speed in terms of its capabilities, Xpient doesn't care what hardware is used. So that's black and white, really. And then in terms of the distribution method, Xpient has very large customers that are sold by a few people in the organization and one of the attractive natures of the relationship is the fact that we do have a nice distribution model and we can bring their product to a much larger audience than they're capable of now and that was really the attraction on Xpient's part to become part of Heartland, as well as the culture, the reputation that we have in the industry.
Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
That makes sense. So it's primarily direct sales, yes. Okay, that's helpful to hear. Just 2 more quick ones. I think you mentioned 9% SME volume growth for September. I'm curious is there a way to parse that to sort of better understand how much of that maybe was OptBlue?
Samir Zabaneh
So we said the actual volume increase was 7.1% excluding the AmEx...
Robert H. B. Baldwin
No, September and October, we were over 9%...
Samir Zabaneh
Oh sorry. Over 9%, excluding AmEx.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
So we're seeing nice sequential growth -- or nice month-over-month growth coming out of the quarter is well ahead of what we had for the average -- the 7.1% average for the quarter.
Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Got it, Bob. So it's a 2-point jump up, got it. Last one, just the G&A run rate. It did step up, so is that a good baseline to grow off of from here?
Samir Zabaneh
There are a number of factors that's included the G&A and I would say the current levels is -- would be the good slice structurally.

Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.
David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
I wonder, could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the last month or so in terms of same-store sales trends? And does lower gas prices likely to have much of an impact on overall volume?
Samir Zabaneh
So the lower gas prices, you would -- if you were to look in the supplementary information on the actual volume, you would see that the volume in the Network Services is lower, but that does not affect our revenue because we get paid on a transaction basis. In terms of same-store growth, we continue to be aligned with our expectation and that has been -- we saw that in Q2, we saw that in this quarter as well. We always say same-store growth will be between 1% and 2%. We were slightly higher in Q2, but that was partly -- probably a recovery of the Q1 lower same-store growth.
David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay. And can you give us any incremental financial impact on Xpient in terms of, I guess, the acquisition price or...
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. So we expect to close the transaction today. We will pay around $30 million for the asset. Next year's revenue will be between $15 million and $17 million. The margins are accretive to Heartland margins.
David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay. And I guess, it's growing...
Samir Zabaneh
For this year, I mean, this year, given the transaction costs. It's a smaller transaction, but the amortization we're not including anything with -- any incremental benefit related inside our guidance.
David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
For this year? Okay.
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.

[Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Steven Kwok of KBW.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
Most of my questions have been answered. Just one question going back to the guidance. If we look at your guidance of $2.33 to $2.37, so should be add $0.10 to that then? And then if we look at the full year run rate has been about $1.76, that would imply that the fourth quarter is going to come in somewhere between $0.67 to $0.71, is that the right way to think about it?
Samir Zabaneh
I sort of lost you a little bit, I wonder why would you want to add $0.10 to the $2.33 to $2.37. We're sort of excluding the onetime items. So if you were to -- based on what I said earlier, if you were to take out the $0.10 from the $0.68 that we actually reported, so maybe we're talking about the same thing. I would take out the $0.10 from the Q3 results and the guidance I gave excludes that $0.10.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division
Okay. So if you take the low end, let's say, $2.33 and back out $1.66, you get the $0.67 on the low end and then the high end, which is the $0.71. So that should be the way we'd look at it?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.

Our next question is from Tom McCrohan of Sterne Agee.
Thomas C. McCrohan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
I had some follow-up on Xpient. Can you help us, Bob, understand how this platform compares to like a Mercury, which seems -- I'm assuming it has a comparable platform for the-small-to-mid merchants to help us understand how it stacks up? And is this a cloud-based offering? And if not, is there investment spending that we should be anticipating going into next year to enable that platform to work in a cloud environment?
Robert O. Carr
Yes, Tom. It's really nothing like Mercury. I mean, Mercury is exclusively payment processing and they're in between the point of sale and the merchant. We do both things with Xpient. We're the point-of-sale system and we have the gateway in between. So you can look at Mercury as a gateway and look at Xpient as the POS company and Heartland provides the gateway to the system. So it's a completely different animal. And what was the rest of your question?
Thomas C. McCrohan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
It's this being -- a platform can be cloud-based?
Robert O. Carr
Yes, sorry about -- yes. Yes. The online ordering that Taco Bell is doing now is in the cloud and much of what Xpient's doing is in the cloud. But what's unique about Xpient, in some respects, is that every location has its own site controller and that's something that we think is really important to not have to be completely relying upon the Internet and the cloud because it's not 100% reliable. So we want to want to have everything controlled. It has a site controller, so that we can do offline processing for payments and other critical functions. So yes, the cloud is used, but it's not exclusively at the cloud.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
And they will have ongoing investment in their solution, but there isn't any catch-up needed to -- in order to transform from a software sales model to the cloud or anything. They're already well along in that -- on that continuum. But they will continue to spend money, obviously, because their success is, in some large part, because they're offering things like preordering, which is a capability that very few people had not that many months ago and is obviously now a huge interest to a lot of people.
Robert O. Carr
And Xpient has some really bright customers that really, really know what they're doing. And there is a lot of work to do to meet all the needs and requests of the customers. And I think our coming into the mix was actually -- and it gives them a lot of resources. We have a lot of payments expertise here and Xpient doesn't have to do that part of it anymore, so we'll be able to take that on and that's going to free up some of their people to work on the backlog of requests from the customers. And of course, every time you roll something out in this business, there's new demand, new things that are needed, Apple Pay being a perfect example, and we are excited because we think we have the resources to really be the leader in this space.
Thomas C. McCrohan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Yes, it certainly sounds that. Do you process or does Xpient process through Heartland for any of its customers today?
Robert O. Carr
We do process for a very small number of them, yes.

Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
So I'd like to focus on OptBlue for a second, just back to the revenue yield versus our estimates. You blew away our volume numbers, but actually came in slightly below our revenue on card processing. So Samir, I think you mentioned in an earlier question that there's a timing difference. Does that mean that the OptBlue revenues haven't been fully accounted for yet? And when they do get accounted for, are they going to be close to the 40 basis points or so you make on volume in the rest of your SME business? Or is it like half that? Can you just help us think about the impact of OptBlue?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. Yes, so you are correct. As I mentioned before, this is a timing matter and you will see next quarter a catch-up that we would have with respect to the actual margin. I'm not sure about the 40 basis points you have. I think we calculate things maybe differently under it. But it will be -- we will go back to be in line with what you would have seen previously, but you have to keep in mind the overall movements of our customers and being into the larger base. So you will see some pressure just because we're moving to bigger accounts, but you would have to normalize for the OptBlue. So that OptBlue now impact for Q3 is just a timing difference.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
But why is there a timing difference? Is it -- it's just because the program just started?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
And there's like a delay when you -- assuming you -- when you actually process the sale then getting paid?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
Christopher C. Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. So attrition, I think you meant -- attrition was pretty impressive, down to 12.8% or so. It seems like a good number. You mentioned some attrition management programs that have helped contribute to the client attrition. Can you talk at all about what that means?
Robert O. Carr
Well, it's blocking and tackling, Chris. We're just getting better at it and I think the volume attrition comes up and down and it's hard to understand sometimes. But we're just trying to do the best we can to retain our customers.
Robert H. B. Baldwin
But with the 1.8% same-store sales growth that we got, we actually had a better attrition performance this quarter. As Bob said, you don't want to -- it's not a linear thing and there are various factors that go into it. But let's say that with that relatively less wind at our back, we are very pleased with the net attrition that resulted.
Samir Zabaneh
I mean, the other thing to notice is that, last quarter, we also had a very good number. So when you compare it to what it was in Q1 or even some quarters last year, we seem to be having or are beginning to have a consistent better performance on the attrition. And there's a big focus on it, for sure.

Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Samir, a question for you. Does the guidance -- the new guidance excludes the $0.10 gain, I get that. Does it adjust at all for the $1.7 million in onetime M&A-related costs you mentioned in the quarter, which sounds like about $0.03?
Samir Zabaneh
No.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
Does it include or exclude that?
Samir Zabaneh
It does include it.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
It includes that, okay. And then in the -- the 9% transaction growth in September and October, you said that was x OptBlue, correct?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division
So what's changed between last quarter and the first 2 months of this quarter taking out the OptBlue opportunity, which sounds like it will drive its own transaction benefit? What's changed so dramatically to drive that growth delta?
Samir Zabaneh
Well, it's a combination of better installed margins that we've been having for the last several quarters. So we have had a momentum that's being built to drive increased volume, better same-store sales and better management of the attrition. So these 3 factors have to come into play for us to see this kind of volume growth. But I'm really happy to see the installed margin continue to produce the way that it has been. If you were to do the math and look at our overall volume increase, take into account the attrition and the same-store growth. It means that we have generated between 15% and 17% of new volume because of the installed margin that we have. And given the installed margin continues to accelerate, we feel comfortable that this part of the equation of driving volume is working very, very well.

Our next question is from Tulu Yunus of Nomura.
Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
I just wanted to go on -- back to the margin commentary and the puts and takes there. If I heard you correctly with regards to the amortization and the other costs mentioned and adjust -- and sort of just strip them out just to see what an apples-to-apples comparison would be, 3Q margin is probably close to 22% x Leaf as well, so x the amortization, the acquisition costs and Leaf, which is still down a bit from last year's margin. Was there -- first of all, does that math make any sense to you? And is there anything that you can call out as -- with regards to why the margin would have been down year-over-year because I do understand 3Q should be a fairly strong margin quarter.
Samir Zabaneh
For sure. So if you were to take the adjustment for Leaf as well as for the -- sorry, if you were to take our adjusted operating margin and you adjust for that for Leaf, then, yes, there's still a gap between Q3 of last year and Q3 of this year. There are a number of factors that have come into play, some of them are only onetime items. But as I mentioned earlier, you would have to look at our overall G&A to be in line with what we had -- what we have right now. Last quarter, we had -- last year, we had a materially higher capitalization of projects that we had so that resulted in relatively reduced expenses. Our overall headcount has increased this year because the company has grown. And I can't recall if you have normalized for the onetime deal expenses. In my answer, I'm not normalizing for that, so that's also included. So when you take into account higher capitalization last year, onetime related to the deal expenses and you would still have to normalize for Leaf, just these 2 items will get the 2 margins closer to each other.
Tulu Yunus - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Samir, I'm sorry to beat a dead horse on OptBlue, but I just want to make sure I understand why there is -- first of all, when was the program rolled out for you guys? And why is there this delay, this timing delay, between the volume and the revenue?
Samir Zabaneh
The programs -- we started rolling out the program at the beginning of the quarter. And I would say most of the customers that needed to be converted were -- there's still some left, but they are being converted right now. The changes in the pricing with respect to OptBlue is not taking into effect until the Q4 and this is just the way that we did it and there's a lot of factors that are included in that. So what I would like you to keep in mind is, as I mentioned before, margin will definitely grow in Q4. Our net revenue will grow with respect to that. It's just the way that we decided to convert these merchants resulted in us pushing the upside of the revenue into Q4 and there's many factors that we don't need to discuss right now.

Our next question is from Paul Condra of BMO.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
One more, just returning to Xpient. Can you give us any detail about how many POS systems they have deployed?
Robert O. Carr
It's in the neighborhood of 25,000.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
And any thoughts on of the amount of volume that they process?
Robert O. Carr
50 billion.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. So I assume you're not doing the back-end processing for them now, but is that a possibility in the future that, that could come on to your system?
Robert O. Carr
Over time, we'll get some of that. These are really big companies. They have relationships with banks that are difficult to break, so we don't have illusions that it's going to be easy. But we have some pretty great products and I think we would definitely -- we already have several accounts that want to move to us to go out of scope because of our approach to the security issues. That's been pretty attractive to several of them. But most of them are in long-term contracts. We think that's an opportunity, but we think Xpient as a standalone company today is a great company. We think we can get it resources that it doesn't have now, and we're going to be the best-in-class point-of-sale company for the restaurant business. That's our goal.
Paul Condra - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. One more then I'll jump. On OptBlue, I'm just wondering, first, just your expectations, what was the take-up? Is it stronger, in line than what you were expecting?
Samir Zabaneh
When we complete the year, it will be in line with what we're expecting.

Our next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.
Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
This is just a follow-up, if I could, Samir. Just going back to the sequential guidance progression. Typically, 4Q for Heartland has been a down quarter sequentially. So if we take the time benefit out of 3Q to sort of put it in sync with your full year guidance, that actually implies a step-up in 4Q from 3Q, which at least, looking at my historical data on Heartland, hasn't occurred before. So is it something around the top line? Or if we look at your tax guidance, it's around 39%. That actually implies a tax rate in 4Q that is in the low 30s. It would actually sort of get us to that sequential uptick in EPS. Is that the lever there that sort of creates that situation versus historical patterns? Is it taxes?
Samir Zabaneh
Well, I think -- I mean, it is not just taxes. Taxes, we will have the benefit of the operating -- of having the full ownership of Leaf for the full quarter in Q4, but that's less than the benefits that we'll be getting from the revenue offsite. So this will be -- yes, I do see that our Q4 EPS on an adjusted basis, will be better than what we have in Q3. But these 2 reasons are absolutely correct, Tim. The bigger factor is related to that revenue increase.
