Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Q4 2013 Covidien plc Earnings Conference Call. My name is Farita, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
During today's call, Covidien may make some forward-looking statements, and it's possible that actual results could differ materially from the current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statements contained in Covidien's SEC filings, including the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q reports for additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements.
The company may also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to its performance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in Covidien's press release and its related financial tables, as well as in the Investor Relations section of covidien.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Cole Lannum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks, Farita, good Friday morning, everyone. With me today are Joe Almeida, Covidien's Chairman, President and CEO; and Chuck Dockendorff, our Chief Financial Officer. We're making some very brief introductory comments and then spend most of the time this morning answering your questions.
For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.79. After adjusting for certain specified items, our non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.91 per share.
Now I'll turn it over to Joe, who will go into more detail in the fourth quarter results. Joe?
Jose E. Almeida
Thanks, Cole. Let me start by saying that we were pleased with our fourth quarter results. Sales are on target, up 5% operationally and up 2% as reported.
In the Medical Devices segment, we had a very good quarter, posting 6% operational growth, with increases across most of the segment. In stapling and vessel sealing, 2 of our largest categories, we continue to grow above market, benefiting from both new products and investments.
For our emerging markets, business comprising Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia and Latin America, we had another great quarter with operational sales growth in the high teens and double-digit increases in most product lines. This excellent performance was led by continued strength in the BRIC countries, which registered growth in excess of 25%. Our performance is a result of the investments we have been making to expand our sales and marketing presence in these regions. We believe there is still a lot of opportunities in emerging markets and plan to continue to make incremental investments to capitalize on them and drive top line growth.
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter performance in individual product categories. As usual, I will discuss our growth on an operational basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
In our large Endomechanical business, stapling products had another excellent quarterly performance led by the innovative Tri-Staple reloads, which performed even stronger than expected. We continue to grow above market in stapling. While our reported fourth quarter performance benefited from the Duet TRS recall in the prior year, our underlying business remains strong. We also had sizable gains in our interventional lung business. Looking forward to 2014, we expect Endomechanical to continue to perform above market with an annual growth rate in the mid-single-digit range.
In Soft Tissue Repair, we're pleased with our results, which were driven by sutures and double-digit gains in synthetic mesh. The sutures gain was paced by double-digit growth for V-Loc, our barbed suture offering, which is gaining increasing acceptance in the marketplace. We expect the future growth of Soft Tissue Repair to be impacted by the divesture of our Confluent BioSurgery product line. As a reminder, this product line had annual revenues of approximately $65 million, and we expect the divesture to close by the end of the first calendar quarter.
As expected, our Energy business had another solid performance with 9% growth. This growth was driven by double-digit gain for vessel sealing for the 32nd consecutive quarter. New products including LigaSure Impact, LigaSure Small Jaw, Sonicision and Blunt Tip contributed to our strong performance. In 2014, we expect to continue to benefit from our robust pipeline of new products. We were also very pleased with the performance of our GI business, which had double-digit gains this quarter.
Turning to Vascular. We continue to deliver double-digit growth in our Chronic Venous Insufficiency products. In addition, we saw some sequential improvement in the growth rate for neurovascular and expect this trend to continue in 2014. We also had good growth in peripheral vascular in compression and dialysis, which represents about 1/3 of our Vascular business. Sales are below a year ago, primarily due to the timing of distributor orders. The overall growth rate for our Vascular business increased meaningfully from last quarter as the comp issues from neurovascular product launches are now largely behind us. While we face difficult comps in the first quarter in compression and dialysis, we're stating -- we're starting, rather, to see positive movement in this business. We continue to believe that Vascular will be a key growth driver for us and expect the business to grow in the mid-single-digit range or better over the long term.
In Oximetry & Monitoring products, we once again grew ahead of market. Sales were well above a year ago, led by increases for pulse oximetry sensors and capnography products. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our capnography business, which grew substantially this quarter. Despite the strong performance of our mid-tier ventilators, Airway & Ventilation was down slightly, driven mostly by our high-end vent business. We expect to see improved sales growth in this category next year as we launch our new Acute Ventilator.
Turning to Medical Supplies. We continue to see significant growth for enteral feeding products as we are still benefiting from market share gains following a competitor withdrawal from the market. However, the strong performance in enteral feeding was offset by sales declines across the business. Overall, we are pleased with our fourth quarter fiscal 2013 results despite a difficult market environment, the medical device tax and FX headwinds.
We had very good execution on new product launches and grew ahead of market in several product categories. The investments that we have made in the emerging technologies and geographic expansion such as capnography, interventional lung, GI and mid-tier vents are paying off as each of these product lines registered double-digit sales growth.
We also continue to make incremental investment this quarter to accelerate growth and expand our product offerings. We expect emerging markets opportunities, a robust new product pipeline, cost savings initiatives and a strong cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver positive performance for 2014 and beyond.
I will now pass the call over to Chuck, who will discuss the fourth quarter financials in more detail. Chuck?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Thanks, Joe. As Joe noted, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter as sales came in on plan. Our Medical Device segment continued to perform well, offset by some pressures in our Medical Supplies business. As noted in the release, we registered a 70-basis-point decline in adjusted gross margin this quarter as unfavorable foreign exchange and increased cost in our Supplies business more than offset the positive net impact of price, volume and mix.
During the quarter, we continued to make investments in research and development and selling and marketing in the emerging markets to aid future growth. SG&A as a percentage of sales declined slightly, reflecting good leverage on our base business SG&A and productivity improvements. However, these reductions were largely offset by our sales and marketing investments in emerging markets and the medical device tax.
On an adjusted basis, our fourth quarter operating margin was 20.7% of sales. This includes headwinds of approximately 170 basis points from the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and the medical device tax. Despite these pressures, fourth quarter profitability for our Devices segment was extremely strong. But this strength was more than offset by significant weakness in Supplies. For the full year, adjusted margin was 22.1%, down 110 basis points in line with our expectations.
Net interest expense was slightly lower than a year ago. The current quarter included a onetime benefit to interest income, so net interest expense should be somewhat higher beginning next quarter. The adjusted tax rate for both the quarter and the year came in a bit better than expected due in part to more favorable mix of income. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.91 for the quarter, a 6% increase over the prior year, despite the impact of unfavorable FX and the medical device tax. Combined, these 2 items reduced EPS by about $0.10 per share or 11 percentage points. The medical device tax will continue to impact our first quarter results as it didn't kick in for us until the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
For the second consecutive quarter, we repurchased about $625 million of stock. We returned more than $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. This is the third year in a row that we have returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders.
Looking to 2014, we feel comfortable with the guidance we provided at Investor Day in September. As we previously indicated, while we expect the divestiture of our Confluent BioSurgery product line to be several cents dilutive to fiscal 2014 earnings per share, we believe the underlying strength of our existing business will offset this dilution.
As we noted, foreign exchange was unfavorable to our sales growth rate. At current rates, foreign exchange will continue to be a negative in the first half of 2014 but will turn favorable during the second half of the year.
We continue to feel very good about our prospects. While we have lots of investment opportunities that we believe will drive future growth, we intend to fund these investments in a disciplined manner so that we are still able to achieve earnings growth in the near term.
I will now turn the call back to Cole for Q&A. Cole?
Coleman N. Lannum
Thanks, Chuck. One quick housekeeping item before we move on to Q&A.
We've recently made some managerial changes in how we run some of our businesses, as well as some internal reporting changes. These changes will impact how we present our different categories of revenue externally. Our hope is to better align the revenue format with how we operate our business, both by category and geography, which we think will provide better transparency.
We believe the new way of presenting our revenue results will be an improvement over the current methodology and will better align with the way we now manage the business. We'll begin using the revised format when we release our first quarter results in January. However, we plan to recast historical data reflecting these changes and make it available to you before the end of this calendar year. We'll also provide any additional guidance information that may be necessary at that time.
While we know these changes will require a little bit of a learning curve as you look at our revenue categories in a different way, we're committed to making this process as transparent as possible. I'm happy to discuss the rationale in more detail offline. And I think when you see it, you'll see why we're making these changes.
Now let's turn to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
Farita, can you please go to the first question?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So I guess I'll start out with gross margin because that's the thing that sort of stuck out for a lot of us, I think, as we were looking at your results. So you mentioned the higher supply cost. I was wondering if you could just talk in a little more detail about what caused the higher supply cost, how much did it impact the quarter in basis points and how long is it going to take to fix and get back to normalized levels in Supplies?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes, Bob. This is Chuck. So a couple of things I'd like to say about gross margin. I think when you look at it overall, there was certainly a 70-basis-point decline from the prior period as we discussed. This came in a little lower than what we expected for 2 reasons. One, the FX was a little worse than what we thought of at the beginning of the quarter, but that is something, again, that just deteriorated over the quarter as the exchange rates move. Secondly, there was a big drop in our Supplies business. We lost 5 percentage points in our Supplies business over the prior year. And this was due to a couple of situations. One, the volumes were down in Supplies. We had good enteral feeding sales, but the other base business was down quite a bit, more than we expected in those areas, and as a result, impacted some of the costs, the plants as the volumes were reduced. The mix of sales was also a little off from what we expected, which caused some deterioration. And we did have an increase in some of the raw material costs, specifically around the proprietary item we have where we ran into issues with the supplier and had to spend some extra money to go out and get that product within the quarter. That situation is fixed right now. When you look at the overall margin of Covidien, gross margin and both operating income, the gross margin was -- when you look at the Device segment, it was actually relatively flat over prior year. And that's despite some significant foreign exchange headwinds. So there in the Device segment, we're seeing that the mix and volume is offsetting that foreign exchange pressure. And then, of course, you've got in the Supplies business, being down 5 percentage points, drove most of that margin decline over prior year. And even when you get down into the OI line, most of that margin, gross margin, drop of 70 basis points, you can see how it fell through to our operating margin. Again, the Supplies gross margin -- operating margin went down significantly from the prior year. The Device operating margin actually increased 30 basis points. And when you think about increasing 30 basis points year-over-year, when you're facing the foreign exchange that we've had, as well as the device tax, which most of that went into the Device segment, you can see the improvement on it. So it really was overall Covidien was down. We feel real good about Medical Devices and where it's going and the profitability and the mix there. We do have these issues in Supplies. We expect the gross margin to improve in Supplies over the next quarter and as we've abated this raw material issue and we expect the volumes to come back to a more normal range.
Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So then I guess the follow-up to that is how long do you think will it take for Supply gross margins to return to levels they were previously? How long is this transition going to take? And if it's going to take 6 months or so, does that mean that your operating margin guidance for 2014, you're kind of probably more likely to be at the bottom end? But I'm most curious from a timing perspective how long you think it will take to fix these issues.
Charles J. Dockendorff
We expect improvement in the second -- in the first quarter for Supplies gross margin over where it finished in the fourth quarter. We're not going to give guidance on that gross margin specifically. We're not changing our operating margin guidance for the year. We feel the strength of the Device business will -- and we even mentioned the divestiture of Confluent, which also puts pressure on that. We still feel good about the operating margin guidance that we gave in the business based on the underlying strength we see in Devices.
Operator
Next question comes the line of Matthew Dodds from Citigroup.
Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
So how about some commentary on BRIC or emerging markets? Can you give any rough growth rates or what you saw in the quarter?
Jose E. Almeida
Sure, Matt. We experienced another very strong quarter in the BRIC countries with growth above 25%. And we've seen it -- great performance in China, great performance in Brazil, Russia still. So we're very satisfied with the investments that we're making as we continue to make them.
Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. On ventilation, I know you got a new product coming. Why was it softer this quarter versus the prior couple of quarters, the larger ventilation?
Jose E. Almeida
This is a capital business, so it goes up and down by quarter. We do the best we can in terms of projecting and forecasting the business. That's very common to see the business going up and down every quarter. So I have no concerns whatsoever. As a matter of fact, the mid-tier ventilation, which was acquired over 1 year ago from Newport Medical, is doing extremely well and is doing what we said it was going to do, primarily in emerging markets. So the large capital item, which is our flagship product, the Puritan Bennett 840, which will be replaced by the Puritan Bennett 980 [ph], we see that all the time. So I'm not concerned at all.
Operator
Next question is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I just wanted to go back to just some of the comments you're making just around the operating margin guidance and just guidance in general with the divestiture in mind. I guess can you maybe just share a little bit more insights in terms of what specifically is going better? You mentioned that the underlying strength of the businesses give you confidence to still meet numbers. But I guess what are you seeing in terms of the market trends that, I guess, gives you that confidence so early in the year?
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think what we're seeing is on the trends of the business is the good strength of growth we're seeing in the Device business across the world, specifically in the emerging markets, which came in very strong. And we're actually seeing good growth -- relatively good growth in the U.S. as well. So I think that's what gives us the confidence about these operating margins, and we drive through the leverage of that. We also -- when you look at some of the productivity initiatives that have begun to kick in, in the SG&A line, we're actually down year-over-year as a percentage of revenue on SG&A. And again, that's despite some -- in the quarter. But what you're seeing there is some -- you've got device tax going in there and some unfavorable foreign exchange, which is seeing some of the productivity initiatives kick in as well in that line going forward.
Jose E. Almeida
Yes, I just -- Kristen, I just would add to Chuck's points that we have a very full pipeline of products being launched in 2014. We have about 6 new products going into Energy. We're contemplating executing a lot of small licensing deals that augment our product lines to make us stronger when it comes to specialty and procedures. So I have -- and emerging markets investment is really being off well. So our Medical Devices business is really solid.
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think, too, and I mentioned the Medical Device business being up 30 basis points on the operating income. Remember, this is the area where we're making all our investment. So not only are they shouldering most of the foreign exchange impact and device impact, but they're able to achieve this improved operating margin while we're also investing heavily in emerging markets, which is in that segment, as well as research and development. So all the investments are going in that thing, and it's still able to drive an improved operating margin.
Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And I guess just specifically on just the guidance outlook, I assume you're still comfortable with first call and to think about the second quarter is pretty similar trends. I would imagine it's first quarter since FX should continue to still be a negative coming up here?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes. One point I wanted to make on the gross margin as we look forward -- again, we've stated this at Investor Day -- is the foreign exchange will have a definite impact on us in the first 2 quarters, but then it will turn. So we'll still have some of the headwinds in Q1 and Q2 on FX, but we should see that should abate based on today's rates. Cole, you want to make some comments?
Coleman N. Lannum
Yes. I mean, while we don't want to be specifically coming on specific numbers in first call, I mean, I don't think there's anything in this release that should change anything that we talked about on the Investor Day, as well as the press release we've put out with the sale of Confluent, emphasizing the fact that the strength of the business is there. And that's why we left all the guidance numbers unchanged.
Operator
Next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel.
Frederick Wise
224379916
Let me tackle the profitability question from another couple of angles. One question but 2 parts. Given the strong mix, especially Energy and Endo were great, why wasn't there greater margin offset there from that? I would have thought it would have been better. And secondly, have you started your restructuring post Mallinckrodt? How far along are you there? And is that a driver of margins as we go forward?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Yes. I think again, remember, the FX is pretty significant year-over-year as it relates to gross margin. So within just the quarter, it's 70 basis points of headwind that we're getting from the foreign exchange. That coupled with the decline in the Supplies business, which is 15% of our business, dropping 5 percentage points, that's really what's driving that decline in the gross margin overall. The productivity programs, definitely we've kicked off. We've reduced corporate expenses. We had a reduction here in the fourth quarter. Part of that was that restructuring program we launched at Investor Day. We also are making significant productivity changes within Europe and even in the U.S. as we regionalize some of the businesses as we move forward. So we have programs in place, projects started. And I think if you look at even this year, we've got significant productivity built into our G&A this year. Over 100 basis points of productivity is in those numbers. And that's why we're able, in the Devices, to increase our operating income year-over-year while we continue to invest in emerging markets and continue to invest on R&D. So these things are formally true. And we expect that to continue, and we've got those programs all laid out.
Jose E. Almeida
I just want to add to the restructuring. We are very focused in our SG&A. We have restructured our sales force, mostly in the U.S. and as well as in Europe. And we continue to pursue these opportunities very voraciously. So time is of the essence, and we understand that.
Operator
Next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was hoping you could go actually into a little more detail in some of the international markets. If I just look at this quarter in isolation when making the segment reporting adjustments, it looks like the U.S. got a little bit better on a growth rate basis versus Q3. But international slowed, although your commentary around emerging markets sounds extremely positive. Can we just go into what's happening elsewhere in markets outside the United States?
Jose E. Almeida
Sure. We see Europe, David, with very little change or improvement from what was before. The good news is it's not getting worse, okay. But then when you reslice Europe in different areas, you'll continue to see significant pressure in Spain, in Italy, a little bit in the U.K. But generally speaking, there's very little change. But we don't see, in the short term, Italy -- Italy is rather, say -- Europe changing its outlook, okay. When we move into emerging markets, the conversation is different. I can focus on the BRIC countries, which we see continue to perform well, not only the markets growing at a good pace but also Covidien is growing 400 to 500 basis points above some of the markets, primarily in Brazil, China and Russia. But when we look a little deeper into the emerging markets, you'll see great potential and growth coming out of South Africa, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Middle East in general. We're starting to see some good momentum out of Mexico, you look at Colombia. So we have a second tier that is growing well. And we have an ascending third tier, which is your Southeast Asia, your Indonesia, your Philippines, Vietnam. It's starting to become more of an attention point for us. So there's so much opportunity there. We don't even know -- by now, it's how it would be done with some of our Class 3 Tier 1 city hospitals, and we still think there's even more opportunity there.
David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up. And understandably, there are a lot of questions this quarter about the margin profile. But if you just take a step back and look at the trajectory of the business, you've done very well with some large transactions over the past couple of years. ev3 obviously brought a lot to the company in terms of top line growth, as well as profitability. Why shouldn't we look at the margin degradation over the course of this year and some of the pressures that you're seeing, not a reflection of the fact that you sort of need another big deal to jumpstart the overall growth rate and see another sustained period of mix and profitability upgrades?
Charles J. Dockendorff
If I just answer that first, David, just to give you -- we talked about this. And it begins to sound like an excuse, but it's a fact we need to live with. The device tax and FX has put 170 basis points of pressure on the OI year-over-year. And so when you look at that, 140 for the full year. When you look at that, that's what's causing a lot of that decline year-over-year. And so that's something that we had to live with, FX being level and device tax not loading into the year. I think you would have seen continued nice operating margin improvement.
Jose E. Almeida
And Dave, when I look at the fourth quarter margin and I look before that, there were some operational issues in our Supplies business. One was caused by a supplier not being able to provide us with the raw material that is very important to us, but also by having lower volume, our plants have a certain level of overhead that needs to be absorbed. So we had operational and execution issues in our Supplies business. Okay, I want to put that clear there. And we are addressing it right now, and we have Jim Clemmer focus on getting that business gross margin up to the level that it should be. When I look at the Medical Device business, we always have the opportunity to leverage that. If you look at our gross margin in that business this quarter, it was almost identical to a year ago despite all the headwinds of FX. So that proves to me there is still leverage and opportunity for mix influence. We always look at acquisitions that have opportunity to improve our gross margin, as well as top line growth. And we will continue to go down the path of augmenting product lines at Covidien with the acquisitions that follow that pattern.
Coleman N. Lannum
And David, one more thing I wanted to make sure because Chuck talked about this. I want to make sure it's not lost on people. Back to this FX and MedTech tax thing. If you do the math on it, if it were not for FX and the MedTech tax, we would have had more than 15% earnings growth in the quarter. Now I'm not going to promise we're going to do mid-teens earnings growth every single quarter or after that annualizes. But it's important to understand that, that kind of underlying earnings growth certainly doesn't argue for a company that needs to go out and buy something in order to fix anything.
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think, too, just so the numbers are right and everybody understands them, we declined 110 basis points year-over-year on operating margin. 170 basis points was due to FX and device tax. So we actually would have improved operating margin 60 basis points and levered that. And that's why we have the confidence going forward that those things level, that we should be able to improve operating income.
Operator
Next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Joe, I want to come back to the 2 primary growth drivers of the device franchise, namely Energy and stapling, and maybe take Energy first. But your competitor noted some pressure in their Harmonic business in the quarter. I wonder if you could update us on sort of Sonicision progress. And specifically, is Energy the primary driver of Energy right now? Is that still coming from emerging markets? Or is Sonicision starting to become a meaningful contributor? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Jose E. Almeida
David, let me just take the first part of the question. I can't comment on our competitor's business. What I can tell you is that because we have both businesses, and one of them the Sonicision, we don't have a product that, that product replaced. The growth for Covidien is extremely good. We're taking market share in that end. But also, what you have is a significant amount of product launches in the vessel sealing space that encroaches into the traditional ultrasonic device business, okay. And Covidien has established a cadence of product launches that also has helped us to segment better the product to the marketplace and continue to have growth across the globe. I would say that the U.S. continues to have much higher growth than the market. Clearly, emerging markets is a great contributor as well. We have -- even Europe has growth way above market. And we are launching 6 new products in 2014, and 3 of them in the next 6 months. So we tend to segment the markets well, service the customer where they need. And furthermore, the products that we're launching, the disposable products that we're launching and coming out of the production line was 50% to 60% lower cost. So it gives us a great flexibility. It's a great franchise, and it's probably one of the most coveted franchises in terms of competition coming in the space. And we've done well after so many quarters, and we have more competitors in this space than we probably have in any other space. So I'm very confident on the technology, second to the execution, which has been a global strength of Covidien.
David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay, very helpful. Let me just follow up, Joe, on that on stapling. When staplers -- Tri-Staple was initially launched, you talked about this as being a multiyear launch and you're sort of coming up on maybe that third year, even beyond that third year, we're still seeing double-digit growth in stapling. Can you give us a sense of sort of where we are in the Tri-Staple global rollout, and what is contributing to this double-digit momentum?
Jose E. Almeida
Sure, David. Two important factors here. The first one is, we are practically finished by launching all the cartridges and the size. The last thing we just launched was the radio reload with a highly innovative product niche, but very, very profitable and well positioned in the right space. When we look at the potential for endostapling, so laparoscopy surgery, we are just scratching the surface outside the U.S. So when we look at our technology being a superior technology in stapling and the ability to continue to penetrate the markets outside the U.S., you see a significant amount of growth coming from other regions of the world, as well as they continue to develop the minimally invasive markets. So I feel comfortable with where we are. We all understand how tough the U.S. market is and how competitive it is, but we continue to do well in the U.S. market, and I feel even more confident about the emerging markets as we go forward.

Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
The first question is just on the Vascular business. You've called out the distributor buying patterns in a couple of product lines now for the last couple of quarters. Could you just spend another minute on that? And does that reverse for you as you go forward?
Jose E. Almeida
Michael, the distributor pattern is something that we usually don't call out, but for this business, was significant for the last 2 or 3 quarters where there was an adjustment of inventory in some of our distributors and evidently, was felt by the business. We are feeling very comfortable going forward with primarily -- and let me speak about what part of the business I'm speaking about. I'm talking about compression and dialysis, right? So we are starting to see some movement now of conversion of accounts and some positive movement that we are starting to see going forward. So as I think the impact will probably taper down about the inventory adjustment at the distributor level, I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the fundamentals of this business that Covidien has such large market share as we continue to convert accounts that were lost about 2, 3, 4 years ago. So that business is highly profitable. It's a low growth business overall because it's an established and mature business, but we've seen some encouraging signs in the marketplace.
Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then my one follow-up, the sale of the Confluent business, it's a $65 million business, why bother is probably my short question. Given it takes management time to look at the process and you have to absorb the dilution to sell that business, so why go through that process?
Jose E. Almeida
It is quite simple. We do our portfolio reviews all the time, okay? It is a good practice to make sure that management is paying attention to the businesses that we're not currently focused on. And also, there is the market condition. As I've said, there's an opportunity in terms of acquired companies, but also the selling of a business is opportunistic. So when you get the right price and you get compensated well for a non-core business of Covidien is worthwhile. This business is solely focused in the neuro surgery business which Covidien has absolutely no presence. The reason we bought the company was to get a technology sealant and we currently will deploy this technology and hemostatic patches and other things that we have in the pipeline. But that specific business was not even sold by Covidien's reps. So -- and we saw some pressure in the market and I think it's a good opportunity for a company like Integra that has ownership of that space. So it is not a big deal of work for us, but it's a good practice to do away with business and sell them when they are not core to you and we get a good price for it.

Next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
First, just some housekeeping. Was there any acquisition revenue in the quarter?
Coleman N. Lannum
Nothing of any materiality, either on acquisition or divestiture.
Jose E. Almeida
So when we look at our 6% x FX Medical Devices growth, that is a disappointing time pretty much organic growth with no acquisitions impacting it.
Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
That's what I was trying to get at. Second up, the Vascular piece, neurovascular, maybe you gave us -- but what is the growth rate for this particular quarter? And can you maybe talk a little bit about the competitive landscape as different companies are launching some new products in it?
Coleman N. Lannum
The growth rate in neurovascular was mid-single digit in the quarter. It continues to do a little bit better than those tough comps we saw back in the third quarter.
Jose E. Almeida
And we -- this is such a dynamic marketplace, Joanne. We continue to invest heavily in research and development. We continue to license and acquire technology to go in. We have multiple beds in several different types of technologies from intersecular [ph] basket technology or open [ph] baskets, all different kinds of avenues to treat this devastating disease state. So as we continue to gain leadership in the space, we're going to see significant amount of competition with new products, new technologies and Covidien will be at par or better than that. We have no intentions to not invest heavily in this business because it's a great margin business, it's a real good market size and the market's growing better than most of our other markets.

Question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.
Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
I guess I just wanted to start in the Airway & Ventilation business with the new, I think, you said was the 980 ventilator coming. When was the last -- the prior model launched? And how big of an impact do you think that this could have on that business overall? Is this something that could really move the needle at all for that business, or is it going to be more of a modest impact?
Jose E. Almeida
Mike, the less ventilator, the original ventilator was launched probably about 15 years ago, was prior Covidien's acquisition of Mallinckrodt, which this was a division of. And since then, we've made significant amount of improvements and software updates and a lot of changes to it to bring the product to what it is today. This is a flagship product. It has one of the highest market shares across the globe with high acuity, but it's time to replace it. To replace a platform like that, it takes about 5 years of R&D because of the complexity of the software and hardware combination. So we expect the 980 to be a product that will probably go in some of its features unrivaled in the marketplace for a little bit. As you know, the growth of Ventilation business is low single digits. So what we expect is to gain some market share and grow slightly above market.
Coleman N. Lannum
Till that happens, Mike, you should expect this business continue to be flat to slightly down until we launch the new ventilator.
Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And I was just curious in the drug-coated balloon category, given some of the LEVANT 2 data that we've see now in the commentary out of Bard. I was just wondering if your thoughts had changed at all about that market. And then any implications for your Vascular business and the stent part of that market?
Jose E. Almeida
Matt, we are a peripheral vascular company. We have every intention to continue to be a strong one. We have -- probably now that we are developing our DCB. It will be probably the biggest portfolio amongst many companies having a significant amount of accessories and stents and balloons and now eventually drug-coated balloon. We're excited about the technology. Our ILLUMENATE, the first in-human study that was done in Germany, reported very good 12-month follow-up. We have a U.S. pivotal trial with about 300 people that we're going to be enrolling. We have a huge trial with another 300, so it's a very large amount of trials that we're doing, so we're very committed to that space.
Coleman N. Lannum
Yes, I just want to make sure I emphasize that the data we've already published from our trials are very competitive with all the other data that we've seen out there, and nothing that has come out over the last couple of weeks at scientific sessions has changed that conclusion.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I had a question on FX and its impact on revenues for 2014. The euro has strengthened in the last month or so, and then your 2014 guidance, you assume 150 basis points headwind. Given that the euro has strengthened, any change in that guidance? Could this reduce the headwind? And would there be any impact on operating margin? And I had a follow-up.
Jose E. Almeida
Yes, certainly. I think since Investor Day, it's improved slightly, so we expect that to be a little less of a headwind than what we expressed in Investor Day; that's for sure. But still well within our guidance ranges that we gave at Investor Day, so I'm not changing any of those at this point in time. And it's early in the year.
Coleman N. Lannum
And Glenn, let remind you since you brought it up that certainly, if we've learned anything over the last 9 months or so, the euro is not the only currency on the face of the earth, and we're exposed to every currency out there and I advise anyone to be very, very careful about imparting too much information in a single currency. I think not only us, but you've seen other companies go out there and make commentary that have surprised people because too much attention has been made to a single currency or 2.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay, fair enough. And then on the tax rate and shares outstanding, both the tax rate came in lower than expected and the share count came in lower than expected, and at the Investor Day, you gave ranges for both the tax rate and for shares outstanding. Given the fact that tax rate and shares outstanding came in lower, should we be thinking about tax rate and shares for 2014 to be at the lower end of your guidance?
Charles J. Dockendorff
No, I don't think so. I think if you look at the year-to-date number, it's more reflective of the actual tax rate that we had for the year. Of course, we have to do -- the full year rate came in a little lower than what we expected, so the benefit of all of that falls into the fourth quarter, and that's why the fourth quarter rate came in so low. I think you start with the base of 16%. And remember, we do not forecast the R&D tax credit until it is approved, so that adjusts our tax rate by about 50 basis points. So we gave a tax forecast of 16% to 17%, and we're comfortable with that.
Coleman N. Lannum
On shares, Glenn, as a fair point, we did buy back a lot of shares in the fourth quarter. I'm glad you pointed that out. This is consistent with our practice of when we generate a lot of cash and we're not spending on M&A, we give it back to shareholders. But remember, we took that into account. When we had our Investor Day on September 12, we were 90-plus percent through the quarter and we took that into account in the guidance we gave in shares outstanding.
Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
So when I plugged the shares into the model, really in my model, I'm trending towards the 4 55 number. So what would be the offset?
Coleman N. Lannum
Well, there are a couple of things that can be offset and this is something I'm more than happy to talk to you about off-line. I don't want to get too much into modeling detail here. But remember, there are things in terms of common stock equivalents and pricing that come from auctions outstanding and the share price. We're trading at an all-time high right now, and part of that affects how the accounting for shares outstanding goes. So that could have an effect as well.

The next question comes from Larry Keusch from Raymond James.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Joe, I walked out of the Investor Day meeting feeling like you guys were anticipating some M&A in the emerging markets and specifically, to help get at some of those Tier 2 or value markets. So I just love to get any updates on whether I was thinking about that correctly and sort of where things are.
Jose E. Almeida
Your thoughts are correct. We always say things are opportunistic and acquisitions in emerging markets are more difficult to execute due to the nature of the acquisition. Sometimes it's not an outright acquisition. It's a joint venture, a several different opportunities. Covidien is still very focused in executing them and we hope to get a couple of those done.
Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay, terrific. And then on the supplies business. That's obviously been a challenging one for a while, and when you think about the dynamics of the U.S. health care market, it's probably going to continue to be challenging and maybe more so. So can you help us think about again just the strategy here for what you can do with that business? And maybe remind us why you continue to believe that it is strategically important to have that business, particularly when you're putting up 6% operational growth in your Medical Device business. And I recognize it's only 15% of sales, but I'd love to get your thoughts on that.
Jose E. Almeida
There are some reasons why we believe the business is still a fit with Covidien, okay. We always evaluate businesses within the businesses, and we always just did this divesture of Confluent because we thought there was no corporate company. We evaluate that on ongoing basis. And if we feel that parts of our businesses are not ready -- are best owned by somebody else than best owned by us, we'll go through the process of selling it. At this point in time, I find that our Supplies business has some operational issues that I'm confident that Jim Clemmer will be able to address. And despite the fact that it is a very tough business to manage, you are in a highly commoditized market with competitors not like yourselves, like ourselves, but distributors competing with us as well, has a very different profile. But until this point in time, we still feel that there is a good fit for Covidien when we go to our accounts and sell Covidien as a whole. The moment that we feel that strategic fit has changed, we'll take a different action then.
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think one thing, too, was -- just to comment on it, despite the difficulty Supplies is having, you need to remember that we have not put investment in this business. This is why we put it into the segment as it is. We are focused into devices, and that is panning out very well. As you can see, the new product launches, the growth we've had around the world, the improved operating margin, the leverage we've been able to build there. As Joe says, that business does lever off of the customers we have and the infrastructures. So when you look at it despite the difficulties, it has a very high return on invested capital. It requires very little investment, and the cash flow is very, very good. So we look at that and we look at the value of that cash flow and it has a certain value to us and, of course, the investors. And you have strategic fits and you also have what we think is worth to our investors and the price people are paying for it. So those 2 components drive what we do with that business going forward.

Matthew Taylor from Barclays.
Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division
It's Dan in for Matt. So first, a quick one on emerging markets. You guys called out a strong performance again this quarter. There have been some others this quarter that indicated a potential slowdown given Olympics, the World Cup. Do you see that as meaningful as causing any potential slowdown or pressure there?
Jose E. Almeida
Interesting. Never thought about those 2 items. Maybe the World Cup and the Olympics caused more injuries and people needed more medical help, but I never thought about those. But I would say to you that, I think that the GSK controversy and the anti-corruption crackdown that is happening in China, you see other countries like Brazil going after -- just going after Embraer, the airplane manufacturer there for corruption. I think that now has a potential positive effect for Covidien, as Covidien has such a strict compliance behavior in those markets. In terms of overall market, we are in health care and we know how little the BRIC countries or emerging markets spend of their GDP in health care. So I think they will be one of the last areas that, if there is a softening or a slowdown in their economies that will hit. So at this point in time, we don't see anything of any significance in those areas, but there will be nothing related to World Cup and the Olympics. Not at this point in time.
Daniel Sollof - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Great, great. And a quick follow-up on drug-coated balloon. Sorry if I miss this, but in your discussion, did you guys provide an update on timing there -- on the trial there?
Coleman N. Lannum
We haven't given details on the trial. We're still in enrollment. We expect to be in the European market within the next 18 months, and we expect to be in U.S. probably in the next couple of years.

From Anthony Petrone from Jefferies Group.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
A couple for Chuck. Maybe just on Confluent, I'm not sure you gave this out, but I'm assuming that business was a lower margin business relative to the corporate average and then maybe what the dilution is from -- on the EPS line. And a quick follow-up to that would be, should we be thinking about other product lines or larger assets that could be for sale this year? And then one quick follow-up for Joe.
Charles J. Dockendorff
No, the actual gross margin on Confluent was pretty high. So it was higher than average, probably within Covidien, so that's where some of the dilution will come through on the gross margin line. But I think from -- in the EPS standpoint in the current year's a couple of pennies that we're looking at, but remember, we don't really consider it dilutive on a value basis. The price we got, we think, exceeds the future discounted present value of the cash flow. So we think from a value perspective that it is accretive and just isn't close [ph] to the P&L on a dilutive basis this year.
Coleman N. Lannum
And let me emphasize again, no need to change your numbers because they're on the bottom line, only on the top line clearly, because we're not going to recast the numbers, we're not going to restate nor take that to discontinued operations. So we'll put some pressure in the soft tissue line as that divestiture flows through, but we'll make up for it on earnings side.
Charles J. Dockendorff
And as far as other assets, I mean, we really don't want to talk about it. We -- I think Joe summarized it pretty well. These things we look on strategically. We review our portfolio all the time. It's a combination of what we think it's worth, what people are willing to pay for it and strategic fit within Covidien.
Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Great. And then, Joe, just on the peripheral vascular, I think you gave neurovascular growth. Can you give what the peripheral vascular growth was this quarter? And maybe just your expectations for that business going forward because we did have some competitive launches there, one out of Medtronic and of course, Silver.
Coleman N. Lannum
That business grew high single digits in the quarter.
Jose E. Almeida
It is back on the growth pattern that we expect the business to be in, and we feel very happy with the execution of Stacy Enxing Seng and her general managers.

From Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division
Just 2 very quick ones. Joe, in the past, you've talked about your Medical Supplies business, while perhaps a bit more commoditized in nature than your Device business, still Covidien finds ways to out-innovate and command pricing power relative to peers. Has that ability diminished slightly with the deceleration in growth we've seen in the last few quarters? And can you talk about that capability going forward?
Jose E. Almeida
One thing, Richard, that we have done, we had a disproportional but highly disproportionate amount of investment in Medical Devices. Very little went into Medical Supplies. The innovation of Medical Supplies bring to the marketplace is how they develop their products with third parties, and how they're starting to license products to put in the bag of their sales reps. We have almost 400 sales reps in that business, and I think there's great opportunity for leverage in that. We're also looking at how to reduce their overhead that we have in our plants across that segment in -- by either combining factories, shutting down completely or just creating an opportunity for more cost savings. So the model for that business is absolutely efficacy and efficiency and go-to market. That SG&A is absolutely one of the lowest, if not the lowest in the industry. So they have -- that's the innovation. The innovation is the business model. It was some product innovation. If we feel one point in time that, that business has not -- will be -- that Covidien is not probably the best owner for that business and somebody else is, when we make the decision, we'll cross that bridge, but not now.
Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division
Great. And then just a follow-up on the decision and evaluation process that you do your business reviews, can you just maybe give us a quick sense of what the top Q kind of criteria are and maybe -- especially with respect to Confluent?
Jose E. Almeida
You cut off a little bit. Can you repeat the question?
Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division
Just as you do the business review process, can you give us a little bit more insight into your thought process as you think about what fits, what doesn't, what's core, what's non-core? Is it a growth criteria? Is it an investment? Is it all about cash? Is there any cash generation like in Medical Supplies? Is there anything that dominates over the other?
Jose E. Almeida
It's the ability to create intrinsic value or value for the company and our shareholders that has growth year-over-year. If we cannot create that shareholder value and that part of the business is not going to contribute, then we take a different look at it. There are several things that we do before we cross the bridge and divest in an asset or something like that. So there are several other things that can be done. You can continue to restructure that business. That business provides a good cash flow. So giving you the process by which we get there, we're not going to help you figure out what we're going to do. We'll be very diligent with our shareholders in mind to do the best things for the shareholder value.

Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division
You mentioned BRIC countries were up 25%. Could you give us an indication of how much all the emerging markets were up and roughly what percentage of sales they represented?
Jose E. Almeida
They were mid-teens. Actually, a little higher than that. Between 16% and 17%.

The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from William Blair.
Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Just quickly on the operating margin, just to go back to this a little bit. Chuck, you had mentioned 170 basis point impact from FX and the device tax. But beyond that, you've got the supply issue right now and then your investment in emerging markets are still, I'm sure, a negative to that line item. So would it be fair to characterize the operating margin in the quarter somewhere closer to 22.5% to 23% excluding all of these shorter-term issues?
Charles J. Dockendorff
I think in the quarter, I think the FX and device tax had impact of 140 basis points. And I think when you look at the operating income, we were down 100 from prior year. So I think -- the only thing is that, the FX and device tax will continue to stay into our business going forward, so I don't think it's fair to assume that all of a sudden, we're going to get a bump-up of 140 basis points once the FX changes. But that's the impact for the quarter. So we're down op income 100 basis points in the quarter, and we have 140 basis point negative impact from FX and device taxes in that quarter.
Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. But just to try to tease that out a little more the supplies headwind and the operating margin, you didn't really quantify that. And then, again, assuming even though emerging markets are growing mid-teens, you're probably spending more from a growth rate perspective in those geographies, so you're not seeing leverage there and we're not realizing the benefits of the restructuring program, the latest one at this point?
Charles J. Dockendorff
Well, no. I mean, I think if you go back, we are realizing the benefits of the restructuring program. Those are flowing through our numbers. And again, I think if you go back to the device operating margin, which is up 30 basis points year-over-year, and that's where the majority of the FX and device tax hits, as well as the investment in emerging markets and the investment in R&D. So the device business itself is performing well with 6% growth, improvement in operating income despite those significant headwinds. The decline in supplies goes to the overall Covidien margin. And that, in the quarter, just on a gross margin basis, was roughly around 70 to 80 basis points. So that was the majority of the decline in gross margin which flowed down to OI within the quarter for total Covidien.
Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. One more quick -- sorry, go ahead. Just real quick on the latest discussion on the potential changes to the tax laws in Ireland. Any latest thoughts on that from you guys?
Charles J. Dockendorff
It really doesn't -- the tax laws in Ireland, they're not really going to impact our rate going forward at all as we changed the amount of tax we pay on income earned in Ireland, that would be it. So countries around the world change their tax rates all the time, and we reflect that.
Coleman N. Lannum
Yes, importantly, I think you're referring to the companies without a country phenomenon that don't have an official country of tax domicile. That would not affect us at all because our tax domicile is Ireland.
