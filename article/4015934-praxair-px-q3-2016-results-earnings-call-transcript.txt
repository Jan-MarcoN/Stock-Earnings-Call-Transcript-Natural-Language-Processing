Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Praxair Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today, Juan Pelaez. You may begin, sir.
Juan Pelaez - Praxair, Inc.
Thanks, Nova. Good morning, and thank you for attending our Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. I am joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelcey Hoyt, Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
In addition, please note that our discussions of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons, excludes charges taken related to cost reduction actions. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the Appendix of the presentation and the press release.
I'd like now to turn the call over to Steve.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover three areas before I turn it over to Matt. I'm going to review what we are seeing around the world. I'm going give you an update on the implementation of our strategy, which I reviewed with you this time last year, and I have a few comments on the discussions we held with Linde about a potential merger.
I'll start with the U.S., which is very much a mixed bag. Our volumes to the chemical industry continued to be healthy as Varian markets are more diverse and consumer-driven. Hydrogen volumes to refiners are starting to moderate as diesel demand weakens and refinery margins compress. This is offset somewhat by higher hydrogen intensity as refiners are turning to sour feedstocks to boost margins.
Food and beverage volumes in the U.S. are strong. I'll comment more on that later. Our volumes into the steel mills along the Great Lakes are softening as auto production, which makes up about 28% of their end market sales, is coming down off of peak production rates. I expect this trend to stay with us until either energy or non-resi construction demand can pick up the slack or global excess supply is rationalized.
The bigger worry card for us is manufacturing, where we saw weak volumes in July and August, especially in our packaged gas business. September did improve sequentially, but given the general weakness observed in Q3, we were forced to make adjustments to our cost structure. And I'll speak more to that later.
Canada remains a tale of two markets, as growth in healthcare and food and beverage in the East helps mitigate the drop in energy-related volumes experienced in the West. Mexico, ex-energy, continues to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace, as the manufacturing sector continues to favor Mexico as a preferred hub to serve North America. Our volumes into the oil well services sector are almost nonexistent today, as Pemex continues to struggle with low energy prices and their own internal issues.
The economy in Brazil seems to have bottomed, albeit at a low level. By focusing on growth in non-industrial markets, such as healthcare and food and beverage and new applications, we were able to generate growth while our traditional metals and manufacturing markets remain quite weak. We did benefit this last quarter from a project start-up and decap in the metal sector.
Far be it from me to predict the turn in Brazil's economy. My personal view is that will not happen until inflation can be brought under control and interest rates lowered to stimulate domestic demand and the government decides to spend less on themselves and more on needed infrastructure, neither of which I expect to see in the immediate future.
With that as a backdrop, we thought it necessary to take additional actions to better align our cost structure with the market reality. Could I be too pessimistic about Brazil's economy? Perhaps. But I would rather plan for no improvement and be pleasantly surprised if things turn around sooner than expected.
Europe is performing better overall. Our pipeline businesses serving steel and petrochemical customers in Spain, Germany and the Benelux continue to do well. Spain continues to re-emerge from a deep recession. Italy remains weak, but we are able to capitalize on small acquisitions there to build density and expand our homecare business. Germany and the Benelux is more steady-state, while Scandinavia remains challenged by the pull-back in energy investment. But, overall, Europe is better than it has been in quite some time.
Turning to Asia. China's underlying economy is growing at a mid-single digit pace. Consumer-driven activity, namely, electronics, healthcare and environmental solutions, has replaced fixed asset investment activity as the best prospects for growth. Though nothing transformative has taken place yet in India with respect to much-needed infrastructure investment, our core business continues to grow at a healthy mid-single digit pace.
In Korea, electronics is growing modestly, while the export-oriented manufacturing sector continues to struggle. Thailand, where we are focused on the growth of our CO2 business into food and beverage and energy end markets, continues to do well.
Turning to page five. The first prong of our strategy is to optimize the base business. This is all about operational discipline and execution, without which we would not have been able to deliver the solid cash flow we reported this quarter. Matt will speak more to this in his comments.
We continue to make solid gains in our resilient market growth focus. The objective is to grow our exposure to more resilient markets from about a quarter of our total sales to about a third. Included in this segment would be food and beverage, healthcare, aerospace, and specialty gases, many of which are used in environmental applications.
I want to touch on just a few of these areas. We closed our Yara CO2 acquisition in June, which gives us an excellent platform to grow our food and beverage business in Continental Europe and the UK. That acquisition is off to an excellent start. We continue to add CO2 sources in the U.S. to further penetrate the food and beverage market and to keep up with the growth of our new CO2 business, which is the beverage carbonation service we acquired in 2013. Over the last three years, we have increased our CO2 capacity in the U.S. by almost 50%. Today, CO2 represents about 10% of our total sales and is growing in the mid to high-single digit range globally.
In healthcare, we have seen excellent growth in Canada, Mexico, South America and Southern Europe, both organically and through small acquisitions. In China, we had avoided hospital gases historically due to our own concerns over corruption. However, given the effectiveness of the government's new anti-corruption campaign, we have stepped-up our efforts to penetrate this market and we are starting to see nice growth, albeit off a low base.
Earlier this month, we closed our joint venture with GE on aircraft engine coatings. Our expectation is that between increased scope, share gain and the production ramp of the GE LEAP engine, our coatings sales with GE will triple over the next three to four years to over $200 million in sales.
Project activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast remains robust. Based on what we have signed and to be announced, I fully expect to start the new year with $1.5 billion in the backlog, two-thirds of which is in the U.S. Gulf Coast. As a result, project contributions, which have been low over the last several years, should contribute on average 3% per year to the bottom line from 2017 to 2020.
Between continued weakness in manufacturing across the Americas, a pull-back in project activity in emerging markets, the need to reduce overhead cost in our Asia operations and the desire to accelerate cost benefits from our two Yara acquisitions, we have implemented a restructuring program resulting in a Q3 charge of $96 million. We expect this action to generate $45 million in annualized cost savings.
We know that many of the headwinds we are facing will abate and more than likely turn back in our favor at some point, though the when is hard to predict. What I have described to you is how we will grow profitably regardless of macro environment. My expectation is this strategy will produce mid-single digit top line and that or better bottom line over the next several years, assuming constant currency and no help from base volumes. Of course, any base volume recovery will fall through heavily to the bottom line, given, in most cases, we have sufficient capacity already in place to accommodate growth.
My last comment will be on the potential Linde merger. First of all, we have not had any discussions with them since we announced that talks were terminated. It was reported that we could not reach agreement on the role of Linde's headquarters. The fact is, discussions were halted before we had a chance to fully vet that subject. Would I be open to resuming discussions? The answer is yes, but there's no guarantee that that will happen, and, if it does, there's no guarantee that we will reach an agreement.
I have been asked about the strategic logic of this combination. First of all, our complementary geographical positions would allow us to leverage the individual strengths of each company, Linde's technology and engineering and Praxair's operational excellence, and do that across a much greater footprint. The combined portfolio would be more balanced and resilient than either standalone. The expected synergies would be compelling. The resulting balance sheet would be robust, with strong cash flow as a result of the expected synergies. Obviously, we felt any potential divestitures were manageable, otherwise we would not have pursued this opportunity.
How do we evaluate the attractiveness of this potential deal? The answer is the value of half of the combined company, including synergies, must be significantly greater than our standalone case. Why significantly? Because of the inherent risk involved. However, that could have been mitigated by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way. This is all I have to say on the subject. As stated at the onset, we are confident in our base strategy and remain fully committed to its implementation.
I'll now turn it over to Matt to discuss third quarter results and our outlook.
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
Thanks, Steve. Please turn to slide seven for an overview of our third quarter results. Sales at $2.7 billion are 1% above prior year and 2% above the second quarter. Looking year-over-year, ongoing price improvements of 1% and contributions from the Yara acquisition of 1% are partially offset by a 1% headwind from foreign currency translation. As exchange rates stabilize, we're finally starting to lap the FX headwinds we've experienced over the last few years.
Volume growth is flat as project gains and organic improvements in our defensive end markets are offset by lower volumes in manufacturing and upstream energy. Sequentially, we have the benefit of a full quarter from the Yara acquisition, but we're also seeing natural gas pass-through up 1%, which doesn't materially impact operating profit dollars, but does dilute operating margins by 20 basis points. This sequential effect is even greater in our North American segment, negatively affecting the segment operating margin by 50 basis points.
Operating profit of $597 million is 4% below prior year and 2% above last quarter. Third quarter operating margin of 22% is in-line with the second quarter, but 100 basis points below last year. This decline is primarily driven by North American manufacturing and upstream energy volume declines, especially in the packaged gas business, where we've lost variable margin without corresponding overhead costs.
This is why we undertook the cost reduction effort this quarter, to better align our businesses with market trends. This action resulted in annualized savings of $45 million from a reduction of about 730 employees, with almost half in the North American segment.
Earnings per share for the quarter are $1.41. Note that this excludes $100 million operating cost or $0.23 per share related to the cost actions and a pension settlement charge. EPS increased from the second quarter, as project contribution and cost management efforts more than offset manufacturing weakness and normal seasonal declines in Europe. As Steve mentioned, we're executing the strategy, and the cash flow generation is a good example of our success.
Operating cash flow $788 million is 17% above last year and 12% above last quarter. This figure represents 29% of sales, which is one of our highest quarters ever. So despite some of the macroeconomic challenges, our employees continued to prudently control capital. In fact, third quarter free cash flow of over $400 million enabled us to reduce net debt this quarter by almost $200 million, essentially eliminating our debt increase last quarter from the acquisitions.
In addition to strong cash generation, we continue to position the business for future growth. The project backlog increased to $1.4 billion, as new on-site projects in the U.S., South Korea and Brazil more than offset the start-ups this quarter in Peru in Europe. We are particularly pleased the opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast to build off our asset network for both atmospheric and process gases. We recently executed a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to MEGlobal for their new ethylene glycol plant in Freeport, Texas. We won this contract by leveraging our pipeline network to deliver high reliability at a competitive cost. In fact, we feel confident in our ability to announce additional U.S. Gulf Coast project wins by the end of this year. In summary, we continue to see the benefits of executing our strategy through improved cash generation, key project wins and portfolio enhancements.
I'd now like to briefly cover guidance on page eight. Fourth quarter EPS guidance is in the
range of $1.36 to $1.43. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the third quarter.
This guidance assumes that full quarter project contribution and benefits from the cost action
are offset by weaker U.S. metals and more negative seasonal effects in South America.
Q4 last year was quite weak for both metals and South America due to extended outages, and
we believe we may see similar trends this year. The full-year guidance range is $5.44 to $5.51. The midpoint is about $0.05 lower than the prior guidance. This reduction is primarily due to weaker than anticipated manufacturing and metals volumes, especially in North America.
We're actively working to improve upon this number, but there simply aren't enough positive signs to predict any volume recovery at this time. But rest assured, we'll continue to execute the strategy of profitable growth independent of the economic environment. And finally, before we open up the line, I just want to remind everyone that we don't have any further comments to make on the terminated Linde merger, so I appreciate your efforts to refrain from any questions on this topic.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of
John Roberts of UBS.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. You have much of your business under volume contracts. When you go down below, for example, the PEMEX business you talked about that's almost nil right now, are you booking revenue without supplying volumes? Or do the contracts get renegotiated or somehow extended?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Well, those are merchant liquid contracts with PEMEX. And there is no take or pay, it's just a requirements contract. So as they use the volume, they pay for it. The margins are quite high, but today the volumes are quite low. As a matter of fact, if I look at the volume trend, it's down about 80% year-over-year. So lower revenue, lower margin. We have adjusted to get the cost more in line with what we're seeing currently from PEMEX. But that's the way that's managed.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Is there a way to think about what percent of your business is at minimum contract volumes for where you do have both on the bulk gas and the merchant liquid, some sort of volume commitment in your contract?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
So on the onsite business, practically all of that would have some take-or-pay commitment. So if you think of that as roughly 30% of our sales, that's all under take-or-pay. The merchant liquid contracts typically are requirements contracts, which just means whatever volume they consume, they must consume it from us and they must consume it at the agreed-to price.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
And I was asking is there a meaningful percent that's actually bottomed out here at your minimums?
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
John, it's Matt. No. As we've stated before, South America has several running below the m-tops just given the conditions there. But other than that, you'll just see spotty areas around the world based on certain turnarounds or other seasonal effects, but nothing that material.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan of SunTrust.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Could you comment on your full year 2017 outlook, or I should say just going forward over the next 12 months, what is your assumption for share buybacks within that?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Well, we're not going give specific guidance on 2017 yet. We have another quarter to go. We'll do that the end of January. We're going to look very closely at that. We would like to be back in the market reducing our share count, at a minimum we offset any dilution that we see. But we're going to wait to see how the quarter finishes, the year starts. But we would certainly like to be back in the market reducing share count again.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Do you have a target for net debt to EBITDA in 2017 or 2018?
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
I wouldn't say there's any specific target, James. Our primary objective regarding that is to stay within our current credit rating. So from that perspective, we might improve on that ratio a little bit here in the next couple quarters. But no specific target.
James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Harrison of Seaport Global.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
Morning.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the North American metals weakness? I thought that we had been seeing some benefits there from the tariff activity that's gone on.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
We did. We saw some benefits in Q2 that lasted through Q3. But as we were looking at the weekly volume trends, we started to see some weakness as some of our major steel customers along the Great Lakes started taking, I'll call it, more extended outages. And what we can conclude from looking at their end markets is that there's a concern about softening automotive demand. Clearly, Ford's volumes are down. They just announced earnings.
So it's more of a concern over just weaker automotive. And that's the assumption we're making at this point that that trend's going to continue. Obviously, if we're wrong about that, there will be some upside. But right now, the assumption is that the weakening oxygen volumes to the steel mills are going to continue to be soft because of softening automotive.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
And is North America still relatively better than other regions throughout the world in terms of steel, or is that no longer the case?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
I would say looking around the world, Europe is in pretty good shape. The mills in northern Spain, the mills in southern Germany are very good mills for those companies. And they continue to produce, supporting both automotive and the growth in other steel sectors. So I would say Europe is more positive than it's been.
Obviously, in South America there's a lot of weakness in metals generally speaking. Those volumes for the entire steel industry are down about 10% to 15% year-over-year. If I were to go to India, the metals volumes are up. If I were to go to China, I'd say the volumes are flat. And so while Q3 volumes year-over-year looked pretty decent in North America, we did start to see a softening trend. And, again, we concluded that's because of weaker automotive demand.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. And then you talked a little bit about the CO2 focus. You've done the NuCO2 business and the Yara acquisition. Your competitors got the EPCO business a few years back. Are there other regional CO2 businesses that would make sense for you to add globally? And can you also update us on how you're leveraging the new CO2 business in Brazil and in other countries?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Yes, so we've added CO2 businesses not that long ago in Brazil when we started up this hydrogen plant. In Peru recently, there is a CO2 off take as part of that project. We continue to look for CO2 sources in Asia. We'd really like to get our food and beverage business in Asia cranked up. So the answer is yes, we'll continue to look for good CO2 sources around the world.
And the real key criteria there is that you have to have a high quality source. It has to be competitive. It has to be a reliable source. And if you can capture those, you're in a great position to continue to grow from that source in that local market. If I look at new CO2, we have replicated that model in Brazil quite successfully. We've replicated that model throughout North America, in Mexico and Canada, and we're still looking at opportunities to do that in Europe as we speak.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Two questions. First, can you give a little bit of extra color on the trends in North America packaged gases? I mean, is that down high-single digits? And is the rest of the balance of North America a positive, or what's the dynamic there?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
So the U.S. packaged gas business year-over-year is down mid-single digits. The gas part, I'll call it gas, rent and other, is down low-single digits. Hard goods is down mid-teens. And that's year-over-year. And then sequentially it's down low-single digits.
So as you'll recall, we had a fairly nice step-up Q2 over Q1 in the packaged gas business. We were hoping that was going to continue through Q3, possibly grow. What happened in July and August â and I've heard other vendors talk about this â it just was very, very weak in July and August. And September did get a little better sequentially, but not enough to really give us a lot of optimism in terms of the run rates. That's why we decided to take the cost actions that we did.
What's behind that? Obviously, the whole energy supply chain continued to draw down throughout the course of the year. Commodities continued to be weak. Ag continues to be weak. Any producer that's driven by exports is penalized by the strong dollar, so mining continues to be weak. So just not enough going on from an end market standpoint.
We do have some positive segments obviously. Specialty gases does better, hospitals does better, others like that. But the major end markets that are metal fabrication driven â rail car production was off. You heard me talk earlier about diesel demand being weaker. That's because less product is being moved from coast-to-coast.
So that whole sector has been weak. And essentially what we did, we just carried that run rate forward into Q4 and assumed that we weren't going to see any help in Q4. And quite possibly, as we get closer to the holidays, we may start to see extended shutdowns in the U.S. and probably will in Brazil. But we may start to see that in the U.S. as well.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
And then I guess secondly, the strength year-over-year in food and beverage, was there just a couple of projects that came on-stream, or what drove that?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
It's been a focus, Laurence. It's great when you've got a strategy that actually gets implemented. In this case, that's what's happened around the world. And a lot of it has to do with working on finding good CO2 sources, which we've been able to do in the U.S. You heard me talk about this earlier in other parts of the world.
And then just focusing on continuing to develop that segment. Take applications, like the new CO2 business model, migrate that where we can. So while our core markets have been very weak and we've been talking about that, markets like food and beverage and healthcare have been there for us. They're not too far afield from what we've been doing historically. So we just put a big focus on it and we're starting to see some benefits.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Steve, on the M&A front ex-Linde, as packaged gas demand slows, are you seeing increased opportunities on the M&A front in U.S. packaged gases?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
I wouldn't say necessarily increasing. We always have a pipeline of opportunities that we're going through. I think what typically happens, these are family-owned businesses. They always want to sell at the peak. They always want to sell when they have their peak EBITDAs and get out right before the downturn. Well, they were too late to do that. And so I would say that the pipeline of opportunities has been about the same. It's the same today as it's been pretty much all year. And we have a few things we're working on and hopefully we'll have some things to talk about going forward.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Fair enough. And also, are you seeing any opportunities in buying ASUs or other people with hydrogen plants on a one-off basis?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
These are things we work on all the time. It's like you've heard me talk about acquisitions. You look at 20 to do two. And you always have to be careful whenever a customer all the sudden wants to talk to you about a decap, which a lot of times is a leading indicator they're having cash flow problems.
But these are things that we look at if there's enough value that can be created between energy efficiency, perhaps merchant liquid offtake, increased reliability, those types of things. If there's enough value that can be created, then there's a chance that we can go forward and do something like a decap. But if they start the discussion or the conversation off with, you've got to do better than my cost of capital. Well, I'm not interested in that. We're not a bank.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you. Manufacturing in the U.S. appeared to be stabilizing a little bit last quarter, but it appears that there's a little more of a bit of a slowdown or some choppiness in 3Q. Can you just comment on how this has trended over the last few months, particularly versus some of the shut-ins you saw within refinery and steel? Then just general expectations as we head into 2017.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Well, it's a lot like I commented on earlier. July and August was very weak. September a little better. I talked about the end market trends that's affecting that. We're much more exposed to metal fabrication. So when you look at that overall Investor Production Report, you've got to go down there and look at the sub-lines to really understand what's going on.
And from the steel perspective, I think it's what we've been saying since the beginning of time. It's so important to select the right project with the right customer to make sure that the asset that you're going be supplying over a long-term contract is a competitive asset on a world scale. And where we've got all those decisions right, we've worked very hard to do that historically, things are fine. They're operating. They're paying their take-or-pays. But if we ever got a feel from that, and we haven't fortunately, then we've seen some people suffer from plants that have been idled or shut down.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. You've continued to outperform the macro in Brazil. And obviously it seems that F&B and healthcare appear to be doing well in the region. Can you just comment a little more about the sequential trends and then just the general outlook that you're seeing across Latin America? Is it basically just bouncing off the bottom, but not necessarily getting worse? And do you expect that to even get modestly better in 2017? Thank you.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
It's a great question. I wish I could give you a highly competent answer. I'll just tell you that we saw the manufacturing continue to weaken in Brazil. There are pockets of Brazil that do okay. Pulp and paper does fine. Obviously, Embraer, that we don't supply a lot to, but they do fine. Agriculture does fine. People that are shipping slabs, steel slabs, out of Brazil to go to other places, those volumes are fine.
But we did continue to see the manufacturing sector continue to weaken. Our concern and what's reflected in the guidance that Matt gave is, as we go into the holidays, they'll do what they did last year. They'll take extended shutdowns beginning early December. It might not come up that quickly.
So the good news is we've removed the political instability. You now have President Temer and so we don't have all that drama. But then again, they have some work to do. Interest rates â the SELIC rate is 14%. Inflation is like 8% or 9%. So that needs to be brought under control. That is their intention. As they do that, we expect to see the economy rebound. But that needs to happen.
And the people that I talk to on the ground in Brazil, and I'm focusing all my comments on Brazil, believe that 2017 will be a little better because they believe it's bottomed. So I think it remains to be seen. And I want to watch it very carefully this quarter and beginning next year.
But in terms of what needs to happen, say, to get our operating margins back to a 20% range is we need some lift in manufacturing, which is merchant liquid business, that's the packaged gas business, and that's very much tied to manufacturing. Just to give you a couple of indicators, automotive production is down 40% over the last two years. 40%. Capital goods are down 35%. So that feels like those have bottomed, but they're extremely low levels. So hopefully north is the only direction we can go from here, but it remains to be seen.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's great detail. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison of KeyBanc Capital.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, guys. Steve, when you think about 2017, it sounded like in your opening remarks that you feel better about getting earnings growth back on task with new projects and cost savings and your strong free cash flow. Any color when you think about 2017? I know it's a little bit early, but just on what you can control to grow earnings next year?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Yeah, I'll give you a little bit. But, again, we'll really want to see fourth quarter and really want to see the start of the year because the wild card really is base volume. And it's not just base volume, it's the composition of the base volume, because not all volume is created equal from a profitability standpoint.
When your oil well services is off 80%, that's high-margin business. Brazil manufacturing weak, that's high-margin business. Metals that we serve off our oxygen pipeline, that's all high-margin business. So the run rates that we're going to see and expect to see are going be very important in terms of how we think about profitability next year. So it's not just the absolute base volume number. It's the composition of the base volume.
But just a couple other things I'll add to that. Obviously, we're going to have some benefit from the restructuring actions that we just took, and $45 million will translate to about a 2% EPS lift. We're going to have greater contributions from large projects than we've had in prior years. Now, a lot of that is second half â well, just about all of it is second half loaded. But assuming they come up when I believe they will, and we have very strong contracts there that will protect us, that will be stronger contribution than we've seen.
Acquisitions will be higher just on a carryover basis from the Yara acquisitions. And then price, we always seem to find a way to eke out at least a percent. That will be my expectation going forward next year. So I think the wild card is going to be the base volume run rate, the composition of the base volume, and we should assume from that when we give you guidance.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. And as a follow-up, it does sound like the backlog is getting a little bit better...
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Yes.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
...at least sequentially as we head into the end of the year. Can you maybe talk about â you did note that Gulf Coast looks pretty good in terms of activity. Any other areas in the world that activity's picking up?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
No. I don't mean to be so curt, but I don't. The U.S. Gulf Coast, that's a secular-driven activity. These projects have been in the works for years. We've been working on them for years and it's based on low-cost natural gas and it's based on the infrastructure being there in place and just the strength of the opportunity slate that we have. I'd say to-date, two-thirds of the backlog when we start off the year is going to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast. That percent's I project is going go up over the next couple years.
So unless the commodity markets reverse and you see some dramatic improvement in economic activity in some of the emerging markets around the world, I really don't expect to see hardly anything in the way of new proposal activity, other than maybe a refinery project here or there as places in Asia and also in other parts of the world need more transportation fuels, cleaner fuel, all of that. I expect we might see some refinery opportunities.
But as far as core ASUs that are tied to some of the basic markets that we supply, I really don't expect to see much in the way of activity. And you've heard me say this, I don't think China needs another plant of any kind. I think they have enough capacity for a long time.

Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks very much. Just a question on the restructuring. It sounds like from your answers to a different question that the slowdown in activity recently was the catalyst that drove the restructuring program. And I'm just wondering, as you think about the size of that and you'd also made some comments about not wanting to do too much, is there a phase two of restructuring that could potentially come if the environment doesn't get better as we move through 2017? Or how should we be thinking about that?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
I think if the environment stays where it is, there would not be any other action. And I really do not want to take another action. We took one last year and we had to do it again this year because of just the extreme weakness that we saw in South America. And Matt already made his comments in the U.S., other parts of the world. So there's not a phase-two plan.
I think you always have to realize that the world can change, markets can change. And you can never really say you would not do another restructuring because you're going have to react to whatever the market gives you. But based on what I see today, I don't expect, or there would not be a phase two to what we just announced.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just a quick one on pricing in LatAm. I presume you're starting to see the currency go the other way. Is that going to inhibit your ability to re-price for the currency mess of the last few years, or not at all?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
That's not going to inhibit it. Inflation's still high there so we have to cover inflation. And, in fact, we need price and productivity to combat inflation down there. So we're going to have to price to the inflationary market that still exists. I know it's strange to talk about 8% or 9% inflation when the rest of the world is seeing deflation, but that's just the facts of what's taking place there.
And we don't talk about this a lot, but we do have competitors there that are struggling. So that doesn't make some of our price objectives that easy to attain sometimes. But we have an organization there that certainly understands that pricing is important and they know how to get it and they know how to manage it on a very granular and tactical level. And they've done a great job and I expect them to continue to do a great job.
Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you. Steve, a question on healthcare. In one of your slides, slide five, you talk about that being one of your resilient end markets. It looked for a while that you might be back in U.S. home healthcare, yet that's a market you exited many years ago due to Medicare reimbursement issues. So I'm just wondering, what's changed? What makes that market more attractive to you now?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Well, as we look around the world, hospital gases has always been attractive to us. And that's unchanged from what we've talked about historically. The hospital business really depends on the local market. Some markets have favorable conditions to participate in the home care market. Others do not. So we look at that very carefully. But hospital universally has been a good business.
And I said I wasn't going to comment further on Linde and I think that was what that question was alluding to. But I've been out of the U.S. home care market for a while. I think we exited in 2010, something like that. And I know that they've been through many, many rounds of auctions, competitive bidding. And that has driven the pricing down considerably. But I also understand that that's probably run its course. And so if you're ever going to participate in the U.S. home care market, now would be a much better time to start entertaining those thoughts than, say, five years ago before the onslaught started in terms of competitive bidding.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
And then a follow up on U.S. merchant. I assume that your merchant operating rates are still through the high 70%s, low 80%s. And it's been that way for, I guess, for the last five, six years. Is there any way to rationalize your U.S. merchant capacity, or is that really precluded by logistical arrangements?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
That's something we look at all the time in terms of based on end market demand trends, should we be running this plant harder, should we idle this plant. So that's something we look at on an ongoing basis.
You are correct in terms of where the capacity utilizations reside. I think we touched 80% in the U.S. this quarter. And we're talking about LOX/LIN, so obviously it really depends on which product you're talking about. LOX/LIN are the two largest products. Argon is certainly a higher capacity utilization than that. And if we look around the world, the answer is probably 70%s no matter what country you look at from a capacity utilization standpoint.
So there is capacity there to serve growth as it materializes. And in the U.S., I wouldn't say there's a lot that we can do to rationalize capacity. We already have swap agreements, product swap agreements, with our competitors. They've been in place for a long time. It's something we continue to look at. But I would say, in the U.S., we're pretty sophisticated in terms of going through that analysis.

Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yes. Good morning. A question back on the CO2 business. So two really. One, if you look out three to five years from now, from 10% today, how big could that business be in your relative portfolio?
And then what are the real synergies as you build new business in other geographies? Is it a localized business, like the rest of industrial gases? Or are there some real synergies between owning stuff in the U.S. and Europe, Latin America and Asia?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
I would say it is very much a localized business. It is very dependent on getting high quality sources and keeping them under contract. And if you're not able to do that, you're really not able to make a go at the CO2 business. So that's something we work very hard to do.
I would say the synergies would come more from just as you have more and more CO2 businesses you run around the world, more and more operations, more distribution, you just get better at how to run those plants. You get better at distribution. And so that would be more so the synergy, I would say, from an operating efficiency standpoint.
And then from a growth standpoint I do believe that this has a lot of legs in terms of mid to high-single digit growth going forward. So I don't know what the math is going be, but it will increase from 10% of our sales today to something higher going forward.
And the announcement that we made MEGlobal, where, as Matt discussed, we're supplying oxygen and nitrogen to their greenfield ethylene glycol plant, we're also taking CO2 off of that plant, some 450 tons per day. And we're going to build a CO2 plant and we're going to serve that local market. So that's three years out before that plant will start up. And so we have strong growth expectations for CO2 for some time to come.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then another area, a little bit smaller for you guys, political relations with Russia in the U.S., deteriorating quite a lot. Has that impacted your business there at all in the last couple months?
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
It has not because we stay below the radar screen. We don't supply Gazprom or some of those large companies that are natural resource kinds of companies that are very closely aligned to the Kremlin. So we're one level or one step removed from that. We're just an oxygen supplier to NTMK, EVRAZ and so I think it hasn't affected us, nor do we expect it to affect us.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Terrific. Thank you, guys.

We have time for one more question.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
Yes, one more question.
Operator
Thank you. And that question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
P.J.?
Operator
P.J., your line is open.
Stephen F. Angel - Praxair, Inc.
He's not there.
Operator
P.J., your line is open. All right. Our final question will come from Steve Byrne of BOA Merrill Lynch.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Thank you. Thank you, P.J., for being on mute there. I did have a follow up on this MEGlobal plant that you're building, or that you're collaborating with. Matt, you indicated your ability to get that project had to do with your pipeline reliability, but yet you're building an ASU for that project.
Can you just comment a little bit about that? Is it that being tied into your pipeline, does that enable you to build perhaps a smaller than necessary ASU? Or is it that the ASU has the backup from the pipeline and you can then have greater capacity in the pipeline? What do you see as the primary synergy here with the tie-in to the pipeline?
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Steve, when you look at a customer, and it could be MEGlobal or any very large pet chem or process chemical company, reliability is paramount. These operations run 24/7 and they're making these investments based on long-term view of their ability to produce their product and supply their product and get the return on those investments they're making. So it's absolutely critical that all suppliers, especially industrial gas suppliers, are able to keep them running and on stream. And so when they seek various bidders for their projects, they want to understand how you can ensure reliability to meet availability of 98%, 99%-plus on a 365-day basis.
So having a pipeline complex, having the ability to store product, make product, buy product and channel it through a very large network of pipes really helps improve that reliability. So if one unit goes down, you have 30 other units that you can put into the system to help back it up. So, yes, this asset will be interconnected, which gives a very strong reliability. And then obviously it gives us some cost opportunities and efficiencies we can do along our whole system as well with that density.
So this really plays into the density, and particularly on an onsite basis. But reliability and total cost of solution are the two most important things for somewhat of this type of nature. And that's what we were able to provide.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Then just the other side of this project with MEGlobal is the CO2 offtake. How do you influence the reliability of that stream and, perhaps more importantly, the plant design to maximize the concentration of that effluent stream?
Matthew J. White - Praxair, Inc.
Yeah, so we've been in the CO2 business since our inception, so we know how to take offtake crude CO2 in various offtake forms. This one happens to be a particularly cleaner one and more reliable based on the type of asset it's coming from. But this is something we do. We build, own and operate these plants ourselves. So no worry on that front.
And as Steve mentioned, we have an existing large business and footprint and distribution network in CO2 already. So this adds to that ability to have strategic sources in the right locations to keep growing that business in these more resilient markets. So from that perspective, no concerns whatsoever. This is something that we do on an ongoing basis.
Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
