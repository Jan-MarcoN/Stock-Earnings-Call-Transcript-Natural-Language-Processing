Good morning and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Zabaneh
Great. Thank you Kate, and good morning everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO; and Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of our discussions might contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represent management's belief and assumptions concerning future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are based on the information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors.
Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Bob Carr
Thank you Samir, good morning everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland. Our first quarter was another great quarter with net revenue growing 22% and adjusted earnings growing 19%. Our results are consistent with the momentum we've been building through our various card and non-card initiatives, and are indicative of the increasing value of the Heartland brand throughout the country.
Our card business again delivered terrific performance with processing volume growth accelerating for the fifth consecutive quarter. New margin installed was a record for the seventh consecutive quarter and March was the best month of new margin installed in a company's history. The steady increase in new margin installed continues to benefit from the addition of new relationship managers and overall sales organization productivity, both of which are off to a great start in 2015.
Growth in our non-card business continuous to be strong driven by both organic momentum as well as acquisitions. Payroll revenue was up 21% this quarter, primarily through organic growth, but aided incrementally by the February 26th Payroll 1 acquisition. With Payroll 1, our payroll processing base now exceeds 32,500 customers, operates in all 50 states and puts us into the top 10 payroll companies in the U.S. as measured by number of clients.
Heartland School Solutions also had a great quarter. We are seeing strong growth in transaction processing revenue as a result of the success of our strategy to convert more school transactions from cash to electronic payments. And revenue more than doubled at Campus Solutions, as a result of both organic growth and the major contribution from TouchNet. Heartland Commerce continues take shape with solid progress in unifying our product roadmaps, streamlining collaboration and cross-selling activities between our RM channel and new dealer networks.
We are in the enviable position of having incredible functionality and are finding new ways to integrate the point-of-sale to our payroll business, turning labor management and employee scheduling into a real-time service that ties our POS systems in beautifully to our backend payroll business. Additionally, we have been able to develop a multi-use token product that ties very nicely into the online ordering and caring parts of the restaurant business allowing restaurants to stop exposing hard numbers for call in orders. These tools also allow the restaurant to have a single source of truth, important for online ordering and inventory management. Heartland Secure is being well received by Heartland Commerce customers and one large Xpient customer has already agreed to convert to Heartland Payment processing, a decision that was helped by having added the security available from our proprietary Heartland Secure solution.
It is important to note that Heartland Secure is now available on generally available hardware payments hardware such as that of Verifone and Geneco, PAX as well as our own E3 terminals. We are excited about the potential that our out-of-scope solutions will bring to our customers both merchants and ISVs. With this solution, we are setting up a standalone Heartland Secure certified terminal that encrypts card information within the devices, tamper resistant, security module along with the point of sales system. This terminal will send the payment data directly to Heartland while at the same time providing the tender amounts in other non-PII data to the point of sale. This greatly reduces the merchant's PCI DSS scope.
The benefits of this solution for point of sale companies and their dealers are significant. First, by utilizing our out-of-scope solutions, we eliminate the POS system from PA-DSS scope, saving the POS company the time and expense to code for payment, to become certified and to become listed. Only the terminal needs the certification and Heartland takes on this responsibility as well as the integration of emerging technology such as NFC. Second, the POS companies do not need the code and certify for EMV acceptance. And believe me, there is a huge backlog growing rapidly for such certifications that are queuing up with each of the payment networks as we speak. The result is significant cost savings and streamlining the time to market.
We plan to integrate our out-of-scope solutions with all of our POS systems, giving our customers and partners a head start on both EMV and NFC, which of course enables Apple Pay. We will offer customers, dealers and merchants, the highest level of security and increased functionality with all of the advantages of integration, while taking the point-of-sale system completely out of the payment authorization process.
While the larger merchants understand the security exposure created by routing cards through the POS, this has been a revelation to the small and mid-sized merchants. That is why one of our strategies is to bring the capability currently enjoyed by only the larger merchants into the small and mid-sized merchant community, as they migrate to EMV. Multi-unit merchants are a particularly fertile field for Heartland. It's a segment where we are generally under represented, and where we believe the introduction of the security and functionality of Heartland Commerce will create new growth opportunities for us.
We've had a better than expected reception by Americas point-of-sale dealer community. Many existing and perspective dealers have enthusiastically received our integrated POS strategy, as well as our acquisition of the POS businesses that comprise the current Heartland Commerce platform. We now have relationships with over 2,000 dealers, and many of them describe Heartland as a breath of fresh air.
Within this larger group, our region of highly committed dealers is already emerging for Heartland. Many of them simply appreciate Heartland's full disclosure business model that plays by the rules and treats them as they want to be treated.
Several hundred of these entrepreneurs are deeply engaged with Heartland and we are equally engaged with them. We offer them the opportunity to add new products and margin such as payroll, labor management, online ordering, weight management, loyalty and SmartLink to enhance their revenue they are already generating from their merchants. This increased margin stack creates a way for the dealers to maintain and increase their revenues without ripping off their customers by lying about interchange and network fees.
Many appreciate the ability to access all of these value added service from one trusted source. In addition to a valuable distribution channel, committed dealers add important POS installation and service capability rounding out Heartland's robust offering at the local level. And what really feels good is that many of them are excited to begin working with rather than competing against the local Heartland RM who has such a strong presence in our local market.
Heartland Commerce is an exciting and natural evolution in this business propelled by very strong underlying trends. The implementation of EMV, the growth of integrated POS and the heightened concerns with security have created a market that is simultaneously wrestling with the numerous other challenges. Our industry leading security solutions and investment in cloud-based integrated POS technology is perfectly aligned with these growing market needs. Our goal is to capitalize on this confluence of added complexity and cost to further expand the Heartland franchise and generate attractive growth.
And with that I will turn the call back to Samir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Bob. Before I begin with the overview of the quarterly results, I would like to point your attention to the expanded specific supplement which now includes additional details regarding our operational results and segments reporting. This supplement is available in the IR section at heartlandpaymentsystems.com.
For Q1 2015, we reported GAAP net income of $17.2 million or $0.46 per share and adjusted net income of $23.1 million or $0.62 per share. Both adjusted results are up 19% compared to the first quarter of last year. On an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 20.7% for the first quarter of this year, compared to 20.9% in the prior year. The decrease was due to a number of factors that I would highlight shortly.
Our adjusted results reflect adding back stock-based compensation and acquisition-related amortization expenses to our GAAP results. Net revenue for the quarter exhibited solid growth, which exceeded 22% compared to the same period last year. Excluding the contribution of completed acquisitions since the prior year, net revenue grew 10.3% this quarter.
SME card processing net revenue was up 11.1% in the quarter, driven by growth of 15.5% in processing volume, in large part due to an increase in volume from new merchants installed and solid same-store sales and related net volume attrition performance. Note that a year ago, same-store sales were unusually weak, primarily due to severe weather conditions. Also contributing to the SME card net growth â net revenue growth this quarter was generated from processing AmEx OptBlue volume, excluding AmEx processing volume was up 11% in the quarter.
Net revenue growth in non-card processing business segments was also very strong and propelled by recent acquisitions. Heartland payroll net revenue grew by 21% and excluding Payroll 1 revenue grew by 15%. Payroll 1 contributed 6,500 customers to our business and is expected to provide $10 million in annual revenue.
Campus Solutions grew by 104.2% compared to last year with solid contributions as expected from the acquisition of TouchNet, excluding which Campus Solutions grew by 7%.
Heartland School Solutions grew by 4%, however ,it is important to note that the prior year included pass through installation services revenue that did not occur during this year. More importantly, transactions revenue in this segment grew by 42%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Heartland Commerce which is included in other segment delivered $5.6 million in revenue and included partial period contributions from Dinerware and pcAmerica. Each of the acquisitions completed in this segments are performing in line with our expectations.
Increases in both processing and servicing and general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the various acquisitions as well as organic cost increases in line with our expectations and business growth. However, there are few items to note, and here I would refer you to the statistical supplement where you will find the schedule of related earnings impact. First, we absorbed cost of approximately $2.9 million or $0.05 per share for the Heartland Summit in the first quarter.
Second, we incurred $1.2 million of M&A vehicles or $0.02 per share in the quarter. Third, Leaf which we began to wind down in the first quarter, and which is nearly complete lost $3.6 million or $0.06 per share, reducing both operating income and margins in the quarter. However, at the net income line, Leaf loss was somewhat mitigated by a $0.03 per share tax benefit, which is reflected as the reduction of our effective tax rate to 34% for the quarter. We do expect the effective tax rate to be at this normal level for the balance of the year.
Again, while already part of the calculation of adjusted results, I want to emphasize that compared to a year ago, amortization of acquired intangibles was up nearly $2.7 million in the first quarter. This also weight an operating margins. For the full year, you will know that our guidance reflect a 50% increase in cost associated with stock compensation expense and acquired intangible amortization, both of which expenses flow through operating expenses on a pre-tax basis.
Finally, we experienced a 48% or $4.8 million increase in total depreciation and amortization in the first quarter, of which $2.7 million is already included in the aforementioned amortization of acquired intangible. Again, I'll refer you to the statistical supplement where we provide comprehensive reporting of all components of our depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, management measure of operating cash flow for the quarter was $41.3 million, up 16.3% from year ago.
Our total debt outstanding as of the end of the quarter was $589 million, which increased sequentially to partially finance the acquisitions consummated in the first quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $15.9 million. We expect these expenditures to be in line with our prior guidance.
Let me ramp up with our guidance for 2015. For the full year, we expect to deliver net revenue growth of 17% to 19% to be between $790 million and $800 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.78 to $2.85. The guidance assumes after-tax share-based compensation and acquisition-related amortization expenses â reduce earnings per share by $0.56 for the year and the tax rate of approximately 39%.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Bob, for some closing remarks before opening up for questions. Bob?
Bob Carr
Thank you, Samir. Before concluding our remarks and opening the call to questions, I'm pleased to announce that the Board of Directors declared our quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share payable June 15, 2015 to stockholders of record on May 28. And once again, I like to thank all the great Heartland team members who are driving these powerful and positive results.
Kate, we're ready now to open-up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jim Schneider 
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. You saw the downtick in attrition below 10% for the first time, and I think it's quite long time. How much do you put down to the improving economy and less business defaults and how much is just pure execution improvement on the RM's part?
Bob Carr
That's a good question, Jim. And it is a combination, when we talk about net volume attrition, that does gets helped by the same-store sales. So to the extent same-store sales increase, the net volume attrition was declined, but even if you were to normalize for the same-store increase you would have seen a slight decline in the net volume attrition. For the most part that is due partially to the improvement in the economy, but also we've been and we have mentioned that before quite focused on the attrition we have, lot of internal initiatives that we are focused on in terms of reaching out to our customers and that's starting to help in bringing that number down.
Jim Schneider 
Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up if I look at your operating margins by segment in the payment processing segment, those are down somewhat. I mean, if I normalize out for the Heartland Summit in the quarter, like â what's going on there in terms of the underlying margins, any other factors you'd call out would be helpful.
Bob Carr
Sure. If you look at our operating margin percentage, let's talk about this from a whole business point of view before I get into the actual segments. Our overall operating margin was around 15.6% this year and if you compare it to last year, that was about 17%. If you were to normalize for all of the items that I mentioned, so that means the actual Leaf losses that we incurred this quarter, but also the Leaf losses we incurred same quarter last year. If you were to normalize for the Summit and if you were to normalize for the M&A view. So these are the items that I actually highlighted. You would have seen that overall margin was 19.9% this year compared to 18.7% last year. So we've actually seen solid improvements in our margins.
And I mean â and even further, if you were to look at it from an adjusted operating margin perspective because we also have seen increases in stock-based compensation and in the acquisitions and tangibles, you would have seen our adjusted operating margin if you were to normalize for this and for the one-time items I mentioned, you would have seen an operating margin of 25% compared to 23.25% for last year. So irrespective with which way you look at it, the overall margins in the business have actually improved this quarter.
When you look at it on a segment basis, most of the items, I mentioned, will be in the cards business. So, yes, you might see a decline with that, but you need to actually normalize for these items when you look at the cards. So overall margins in cards are actually quite solid.
Jim Schneider 
Okay. So normalizing for all that like it's all the non-GAAP items basically?
Bob Carr
Yeah. The non-GAAP items and the one-time items that I mentioned earlier, Jim.
Jim Schneider 
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Koning
Yeah. Hey, guys. Nice job. It seem like there is a lot of hypersensitivity from investors kind going into the quarter on costs, and you kind of walk though all the higher level costs and India had a really nice quarter. I am just wondering sequentially now because Q1 had so many cost, usually margins go up about 400 basis points sequentially in Q2 if we look at the last several years, but because Q1 was so high kind of non-recurring type expenses, Q2 I mean should we expect the margin expansion to be more than that sequentially?
Bob Carr
What I would like to focus David is, on the margins for the whole year, I'll not give guidance on any particular quarter, Q2 is typically better than Q1. You would have to think of some of the other elements including contribution from TouchNet, which would still help in the Q2 results. So I guess my answer would be, if there are no other factors involved in this then you should see an increase in margins for Q2, but I would rather focus on the overall annual margins, I don't want to give detailed guidance on the quarter.
Dave Koning
Okay. Now that's fair. The one other thing that people are often focused on a lot is the card yield. And I know, I think total processing revenues up about 10%, while volumes were up about 16% so there was a little bit of a yield gap, there's yield compression I guess. And I know you expected that, but maybe can you just walk through why that is again and then how that plays out longer term like if you expect that compression to actually gets smaller and gets closer to parity over time?
Bob Carr
Sure. So our current yield in terms of degradation is still in line with what we have seen in the past. We continue to see our volume moving into the larger customers. So naturally, we're getting more volume but we're also getting lower yield from them, because they could negotiate that. And that trend will continue as long as we continue to grow into that market. We believe at some stage, we will start â we would start to level.
And that decline, you will see it becoming less and less over time, it is a competitive market, and we are exposed to that. But we are certainly given as we mentioned before that, our portfolio is already competitive, we don't see a lot of decline coming like other companies with just because of high valued customers leaving, plus it's important to know that when we lose customers, we're losing the smaller end of the customers. And those customers tend to be higher value from an Xpient point of view. And I think you'll see the concentration being more on the larger customers over time, but those larger customers also provide a lot more volume. And hopefully, the attrition from them would become less and less.
If I could add, in the first quarter looking, we're very tentative to how our sales people are holding price in the marketplace. And if we look at year-over-year in our different volume buckets, essentially all of the volume buckets, the estimated margin in basis points this year was a little bit better than last year's. And the overall margin was the best it's been for the last three years or four years. So the weighted average. So as Samir says, as we go to the higher merchants, larger merchants, they will have lower basis points in yield, but that pricing discipline we think is still being displayed by our sales people.
Dave Koning
Got you. So, the more of a mix issue than absolute pricing decline issue?
Bob Carr
Yeah.
Dave Koning
Okay, great. Well, good job. Thank you.
Bob Carr
Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Tien Tsin Huang
Thanks, good morning. How did the gross margin installed come in versus plan, and did you give the metrics on sales force over sales rep adds in the quarter?
Bob Carr
The installed margin came in line with our expectations slightly lower, but not much different from what we actually expected. We do have in the supplemental sheet the increase we have in the head count for sales, and that increase is also in line with what we expected. We still guide that we would increase our overall number of RMs for the year between 100 and 150. I know that there may be a big range, but really our efforts are really focused on coming in at the higher end of the range. But as we've see in the prior years, we might be adding a lot of great sales people, but we also lose some from time-to-time.
Tien Tsin Huang
Okay.
Bob Carr
So far our performance on installed margin and number of sales people is in line with our expectations.
Tien Tsin Huang
The sales force reps on track. Okay. And then just my follow up just on the Payroll 1 acquisition, just curious why this asset was attractive to you? Was it the technology, the geography, and how does it fit with the innovation piece? Thanks. That's all I had.
Bob Carr
Tien-Tsin, the Payroll 1 is attractive. We have a nice customer base, have offices in cities where we're not very strong, and also have a great tax product. And that's particularly attractive to us because we outsource our tax software to ADP currently. And this will give us the ability to bring it in-house, which will save us considerable amount of money. Also, they assess on really great sales people to know the payroll business called. And as we integrate our payroll into the point of sale with time and attendance and labor management then it becomes a very, very attractive combination for us to be offering. And we're the only payments company I believe that's in the payroll business as well. So we're in a particularly nice position. And Payroll 1 is just a very professional company and we're integrating it into the rest of our payroll business.
Tien Tsin Huang
So the elevation in payroll platform will be the surviving when it sounds like or though some combination?
Bob Carr
The surviving platform is going to be the platform we developed.
Tien Tsin Huang
Into your own point of sales, got it.
Bob Carr
Yes right. Yeah.
Tien Tsin Huang
Thank you. That's all I had. Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Bob Carr, I wanted to see if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts and commentary around EMV, and how Heartland is different from the competition? And also, how your Heartland Secure and other EMV solutions sort of dovetail or fit in with Heartland Commerce, as you move more into the ISB space, and specifically, how you differentiate and what that might mean for market share?
Bob Carr
Yeah. That's a great question, Andrew. Heartland Secure is end-to-end encryption plus tokenization plus EMV. And we strongly believe that encryption is required in this new marketplace because EMV does not encrypt transactions. And the bad guys can still come in and pull unencrypted data out of an EMV product set. And it's true that they can't make a counterfeit card because all the data â so much of the data is dynamic and the card brands â the chip technology is very effective that way. But there is enough information that's unencrypted in the transmission that the card numbers available, the expiration dates available, the full name of the consumer, and the date is available to go online and do online purchases. And this is what's happened right across and in the rest of the world, with UK getting all the [ph] diversity about how their card has gone up and card not present transactions. We are not introducing EMV that way. We're introducing EMV with end-to-end encryption.
And of course point-to-point encryption is a big sales point in the marketplace and point-to-point encryption is really good, but end-to-end encryption is better. And because we are the processor and we handle the full range of the authorization and gateway services most of the time, we can provide and do provide end-to-end encryption along with EMV. So that's one point, Andrew.
The second big argument is that, we are taking the card numbers out of the point-of-sale with out-of-scope and there are competitors that have these products. They're really good products and ours is a really good product too. But there's only a few of us that have it. A differentiator for us is we build this into our transaction processing fee and we don't charge any extra fee. We build â we paid voltage a lot of money to build their encryption into payments and we own that technology, and we don't have variable transaction costs to offer this encryption service.
So the approach that we're taking with our point of sale companies and our dealers is to have a side by side terminal that's in between the point of sale and us and we and that device connects straight to us we pass back and forth to the POS only the tender amount and the information that's not PII, so that that system is never in scope. And that's our competitive position. We're bringing it down market. The really big merchants are already doing this with our competitors. We're bringing it down market and also offering it to our larger competitors as well. So I can go into more detail if you want me to, but those are the two main things.
Andrew Jeffrey
No. That's very helpful. And do you think that is your sense and I know it's early days especially in your ISV channel or initiatives do you think that that message, which is pretty complex is resonating with SMBs, do they appreciate that there is this distinction and as a consequence do they focus in on EMV or are they focused in on NFC perhaps? And I guess part of the markets thought is small businesses aren't going to care or don't have a lot of fraud, so how does that actually work as you go to market with these solutions?
Bob Carr
Well, resonating would certainly be an overstatement. It is not resonating with the small merchants. I just gave a key note address at the InformationWeek Conference on Tuesday in Las Vegas and was talking to the CIOs of major corporations around the world and this was news to most of them. So the answer is no, absolutely the small merchants don't get this yet. But what I think is going to happen and is we're going to get to October and a lot of merchants aren't going to be implementing an EMV solution, and then, there is not going to be a big breach. And then, people are going to start getting cards reissued, because their cards are being used for card not present transactions. And the whole world is going to be, like what, what's going on here? We just wanted this chip card solution. This was supposed to solve our problem, and now, we have the same problem still. And this because of the lack of encryption. So it's not resonating. I think it's going to take a while before until October at least. And there'll be some breaches. There's no question about it. And now, the merchants are exposed to the counterfeit card problem. So I think the reckoning is not going to be come so much this year, as it will late this year and next year.
In that context, the Heartland Secure warranty is something that someone can grab onto. And say, okay, well, I'm not sure I understand this but that makes sense to me.
Whoever are getting a lot of traction, Andrew, and this is a little bit surprising, is that the ISVs, the software companies that are developing the technology getting certified right now is really a problem. There's a huge backlog of certifications. And time to market is almost a deal killer now for a lot of these. So if they don't have to get PA-DSS certified because they're going over to a solution like ours, that's a huge benefit to them right there. And the ISVs are aware of this issue. They just don't know what they had to do to get certified.
We just thought today, there was just an announcement about the card networks coming up with some ways to improve the process, the certification process, which is great, but really is a recognition of how bad the problem is Bob was just describing it. And there are just thousands of dealers â thousands of POS systems out there, all of which have to get through a rather small eye of a needle if you will to get certified in time.
Andrew Jeffrey
So I would think that'd be a market share opportunity for our own?
Bob Carr
I think it is, but we have lot of educating to do and so, your question is very timely and lots of people, I think, would benefit from knowing more about this.
Andrew Jeffrey
Right. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.
Steven Kwok
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had was just around the same-store sales trend that you saw in the quarter, and then if there is any update around April?
Bob Carr
April continues to look strong, and we feel it will be another good month without getting into many of the details. The one thing, as I mentioned in my remarks, same-store sales last year were just unusually weak. So when you look at the increase compared to the last year, you would notice that it may be higher here. What I would like to do is maybe wait another quarter and hopefully this trend is going to continue. We do feel and from speaking with the cards brands and looking at the overall economy, there is definitely a positive momentum and we believe same store sales will continue to be strong but to answer to your question, April is very good.
Steven Kwok
Got it. And then just around the raised net revenue guidance, could you just talk about the factors that's leading to the raise?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. We took the guidance that we gave last year â that we gave last time and we added the annualized portion of Payroll 1. Payroll 1 delivers $10 million on an annual basis. We didn't have Payroll 1 for the full quarter, but we will not have for the full year, but we assume we are going to get to $10 million increase annually. And in terms of increasing our overall guidance for the other factors of the business, so let me walk you through some of the other segments.
All of the acquisitions that we made and we gave guidance with respect to the revenue will come in line with what we said. So that leads the core business, certainly same-store sales if they continue to [indiscernible] that we have seen and I gave the guidance of 53% for the year. If they exceed the 3% then that will be an upside to the revenue guidance that we gave, but as I mentioned I do want to see few more months before we make a call â rest of the year.
Steven Kwok
Got it. And then just as a clarification around the tax rate, do you expect the tax rate to be 39% for the full year and how should we think about it on a quarterly basis?
Samir Zabaneh
The tax rate will go back up to the 39% for the remainder of this year, but for the full year it will be slightly below that because of the lower tax rate we had in the first quarter. The reason why this tax rate was lower was basically a one-time advantage that we were able to capitalize on some of the Leaf losses that we had, but that's not expected to be repeated in Q2, Q3 and Q4.
Steven Kwok
Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.
Samir Zabaneh
Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Smitti Srethapramote
Yes. Good morning. You guys held the Heartland Summit a couple of weeks ago, can you share with us the feedback that you got from the sales force regarding your recent shipment strategy to work with ISDs?
Bob Carr
The main feedback Smitti is that, we broke our record in three weeks â our monthly record in the last three weeks, all in the last three weeks of the month. There was â a lot of energy came out of that Summit. The sales organization at Heartland has grown, but overall, it's a much smaller part of the company than it was 10 years ago. And so we had a â this Summit was much more focused on the corporate and the products that we're doing, that have now that are not necessarily tied into our direct sales force. So it was a very educational time, very uplifting. And a lot of energy was exhibited with installations for the rest of the month, and that's going to carry on into April. It has carried on into April and well in demand as well. So it was a very positive event.
And particularly, on the interaction on the dealer initiatives, the Heartland Commerce initiatives, a lot of questions, a lot are trying to figure things out, but a lot of enthusiasm just as we found a lot of dealers we're sick and tired of competing with the RMs. The RMs are looking forward to having better relationship with dealers. Not all dealers are going to want to work well with Heartland and we know that, but we think that the great majority are going to want to work with us. And we're putting together â we put together a value prop that is very attractive to them. It will take some time to have that play out. It's with our acquisitions and some of our other initiatives on that just taking a different approach and people are still figuring it out.

Got it. And then, just two quick follow-up questions on payroll. Can you give us the organic growth for the payroll business in Q1? And as a follow-up to that, a lot of other payroll companies that focus on small businesses are having a lot of success with the PEO product, just wondering as you get larger and larger, is that something that you would consider providing to your current payroll customers also?
Samir Zabaneh
So the organic component of the payroll business was 13% so that's excluding Payroll 1? I think Bob knows the most about PEO, which is not a huge amount, but I would say that it is an area that's shown some good growth. We don't really focus on that, and so far we got a lot of other things underway. So I never say never, but that's not where we're focused right now.
Smitti Srethapramote

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ramsey El Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El Assal
Hi, guys. This question is for Samir, can you parse out the drivers that have you getting into your upwardly revised guidance range? I guess, I'm looking at a gross margin installed number with a growth rate which has kind of been decelerating for a handful of quarters given on an absolute basis is a large number granted, just trying to understand how the factors will combine to kind of see your top line accelerate into your upwardly revised guidance range?
Bob Carr
Sure. So, yes, the installed margin from a growth perspective is starting to decelerate, but one component to always remember is that we are not â the benefit for this year is not necessarily for the installed margin only that we're signing this year. It's really all of the installed margin increases that we had over the last year, that actually builds very momentum for this year. You could ask about the decelerating installed margin when we look into the future years and I could touch upon that, but for now if you look at â if you parse out our volume growth. And so, same-store sales has been strong this quarter, and hopefully it will be stronger. But another important component is that, if you look at volume we're adding from new customers and that's coming because of the activities we have in the installed margin, every quarter for the last several quarters will be able to add close to 20% increased volume higher volume coming from new customers.
So the sales momentum that we've been having and the good news we've been reporting related to installed margin is actually translating into the top line growth. So to the extent we could continue to â and I mentioned the volume growth including AMEX of our just over 15%, excluding AMEX is close to 11% and that is a solid volume increase, and to the extent rates remain trending to the same way that we have been trending. We feel that the core business on the card side is going to continue to grow this way. And as I mentioned earlier, all of the acquisitions that we completed and we announced in the guidance are going to come in line with what we have, and when you add it more together we feel pretty good about the revenue increase we announced here.

The next question is George Mihalos of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
George Mihalos
One question and nice momentum in the quarter. Samir, I wanted to follow up on a comment or your commentary around the SME volumes. If we sort of strip out the OptBlue benefit, you've still been growing double-digit for the last two quarters. You've actually accelerated in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, and it sounds like there is pretty good momentum going into the second as well â obviously with same-store sale. So I am just curious, is it possible that we see ex-OptBlue double-digit growth at SME volumes for the year and is that a little contemplated in your $800 million top line number?
Bob Carr
It is possible that you would see double-digit growth for, in terms of volume for the year. And that's not entirely contemplated in the top-line â in the top-end of our range but it is possible. As I mentioned earlier, George, same-store sales is a very big factor, given the size of our portfolio, it does make a very big difference. So that would be the one area that I would say could play up or down closer to the upper-end of the revenue range...
George Mihalos
Okay.
Bob Carr
All else being the same, yes.
Operator
The next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
David Hochstim 
Yeah. Hi, thanks. I wonder just following up on George's question. The same-store sales increase, is there any way to gauge how much of that was weather related and how much is maybe customer spending more because of lower gas prices finally? And then, I wonder if you could give us an update on Leaf?
Bob Carr
Okay. So on the same-store sales, it's somewhat hard to pinpoint to the weather because actually, from my perspective, we had a very bad February in terms of weather. So I can't say, it was too cold. So I can't say, it was all the weather. But certainly last year, I think it was commonly know that the bad weather across the whole first quarter was a very big factor. But I do believe, if you look at the overall macroeconomic data there is a positive trend. 
Certainly, at the higher-end of the merchants, when you look at the type of customers that we have especially on the restaurant side, all of the upper-end restaurants, they had exceptionally strong performance in the quarter. So I wouldn't say it's all weather related. I'd say, maybe partially especially compared to last year. But generally speaking, we believe the overall momentum in the economy is growing in the right direction. And then on Leaf, I'll just update that. Leaf is winding down and we will be closing our offices at the end of June.

The next question is from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Jason Deleeuw
Yeah, thanks. Good morning. A question on the dealers, I believe you guys said 2,000 dealers, does that compare to the Trusted Dealer network of 250, is that apples-to-apples. Just help me understand that a little bit.
And then the â the dealers that you guys are working with versus those who are not working with, what are the characteristics of those that you are working with? And why are they working with you, why are the ones that aren't working with you, aren't? So if you could just give us a little bit more perspective on that. Thank you.
Bob Carr
Yeah. That's' really a great question. People can't find the POS business, and it's true that we have 2,000 dealers that have sold products for our Heartland Commerce division now. So, that is a true number and that's sort of the way the industry counts things. We have about 375 dealers, who are now in the Trusted Dealer program, and we're rolling out a partner program above and beyond the Trusted Dealer program next quarter. But the â what many dealers are ISOs, they call themselves dealers, and that's welcome to America, and the free enterprise system which is just fine.
Samir Zabaneh
The ISOs, however, don't want to work with us because they'll earn $1,000 a year on the POS, and they'll earn maybe $5,000 a year on the processing, because of the relationship and the way this world is working right now with the deception and interchange that the merchants just don't know about. So the ISOs are never going to be our friends because we're competing in the payments business directly.
The dealers who are really dealers, who have service people that go out and fix equipment, these are the people that really are like our model a lot. We pay them a fee to take the service calls, we pay them a transaction fee for the referrals. It's not as much money. We can't pay them as much money as some â as others, because we don't do the fees structure the same way. We make a couple thousand dollars or $1,500 on a merchant, not $5,000, so we can't pay them as much. But they also understand that their customers are very upset with them when they find out that they've been paying way more for payment processing than they were told they were going to be paying.
So we have the margin sack. The advantage we have is that we have fully disclosed pricing and that is a value by a lot of these business people. But we have the payroll margin sack, we have the smart link capability, gift and royalty and the labor management, weight management, these different products. We will pay the dealer again for servicing the merchant for each of those and also a referral fee if they're helping the selling process. So they're going to be able to earn a lot more money with us and still treat their customers right and that's very-very attractive to many-many in the â community.

The next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff
Good morning and thanks for taking my question. My question is a follow up on the payroll discussion that's been going on, it's something that we think of your business. I know it's bigger piece of your business and the rolling up seems to be working nicely. Can you give us an update on how the sales strategy on that is working, I know that you had experts that were coming in to help the more general RM cell. Is that still the strategy, how is the take rate, any evolving new sales practices or best practices as you acquire some of these companies that are maybe increasing that take rate? Thanks.
Bob Carr
Great question. Yes, the [indiscernible] program, the special product device or model is working better than ever. We've been attracting some very strong sales people from our competitors in the payroll business, because we do have our compensation model, which is really what made Heartland originally with the signing bonus program, the portfolio equity. That same model works for us in payroll, it's really attractive to a highly capable successful payroll salesperson. So our recruiting of these people has been aggressive and successful. And we're really flexing our muscles now in recruiting more people, and think we have a great runway ahead of us.
Operator
The next question comes from Tulu Yunus of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Tulu Yunus
Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the VAR and ISV channel, the number of dealers seems to be rising [indiscernible] prices. But how much of your new business if you could share is coming from that channel now?
Bob Carr
That's I don't know the answer to that, it's so new. And with the two of the acquisitions, we're just in the middle of the first quarter, and we just now are getting, people started up as trusted dealers. We've always had work â we've always worked with dealers, but those numbers aren't at the top of my head.
Samir Zabaneh
And it really â it's really hard to distinguish, you can have a Heartland salesperson who goes into a dealer, who is working with one of the competition, but we still get the business. I mean we're still certified to that low haul or whatever system, that will be clearly not related to our trusted dealer network. It'll be because of the strength of our RM. Another deal that comes from a trusted dealer working with an RM is indistinguishable. So it's I think POS sales of two merchants that are using POS systems is probably in the 30% to 40% range of our installs.
Bob Carr
In terms of installs and in terms of dollars of margin, it's over 50% now.
Samir Zabaneh
Yeah, it's over 50%, but distinguishing between a good RM who overcame on objecting dealer and a dealer who is helping an RM is never going to be knowable.

The next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chris Brendler
Hi. Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Samir, I really appreciate the organic revenue growth number. I just had a little trouble getting the same estimate myself. I think you said organic revenue growth was 10.3%, is that correct?
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
Chris Brendler
Okay. And I just â which acquisitions are you backing out of that because [indiscernible] a little bit lower number based on my estimate, but â and also, what was the organic revenue growth last quarter? My calculation it's relatively similar on a 10% range.
Samir Zabaneh
So the acquisitions that we are backing out basically all of the ones that have been completed since the end of last quarter so we're backing out TouchNet, Xpient, Dinerware, pcAmerica and that's it.
Bob Carr
Payroll 1, MCS.
Samir Zabaneh
And MCS.
Chris Brendler
Okay. Maybe I can follow-up offline and see where I'm miscalculating that number. On the OptBlue front relatively stable contribution to revenue, I'm estimating like $4 million, $5 million, $4.5 million, $4.7 million maybe.
Samir Zabaneh
Yeah.
Chris Brendler
Okay. And I notice that we don't get NWS volume anymore. So I was making sure that's correct because I like to calculate the spread here and you're giving us SME volumes, but card processing also includes NWS, but if we don't get the NWS volumes anymore?
Samir Zabaneh
Because the NWS volume we noticed I mean they fluctuate so widely over time given the price at the pump instead we're giving you NWS number of transactions, which is much more relevant as the major revenue. We do get paid on that business on transactions.

The next question is from Paul Condra of BMO. Please go ahead.
Paul Condra
Thanks guys and good morning. Just real quick on looking at 2Q. Jeff, any indication on same-store sales trend just wondering to the extent gas might be helping, do you see that maybe accelerating into the second quarter?
Samir Zabaneh
Paul, as I mentioned earlier, April looks good, but we can't give any comment on Q2 yet. If the gas price â if the lower gas prices during Q1 have helped in same-store sales, they are still relatively low so maybe that will same-store sales but...
Bob Carr
No, I mean the petro prices being lower has actually hurt if you look at the supplement petro. We're only showing you the supplement the SME petro installs we have. And that was same-store sales was down 24% because of the much lower prices than a year ago. That's going to be the case in the second quarter in all likelihood unless we see a dramatic change. So petro prices are hurting what we report in terms of same-store sales growth, but it's a very small part. We're not including the network services business. It's just the independent gas stations over there. I think that, your point Paul, was about whether the overall decline in gas prices [indiscernible] portfolio. Did that help the disposable income of people to actually spend more, I think this was Paul's point. And we believe that there is an extent to that, but we cannot give an indication of who much did that help.

The next question comes from Craig Marr of Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Craig Marr
Yeah, hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could comment on how restaurants are approaching EMV integration, considering the challenges they have with terminals being behind the counter or in the back. And also was the lower tax rate in the quarter contemplated in the guidance you gave us last quarter? Thanks.
Bob Carr
So, I'll take the first one. Restaurants are â you're right, they're having â they're dealing with EMV very slowly. Our approach is this out-of-scope Heartland Security solution that I talked about earlier. And we are â we've many restaurants that we want to go to it, but many more that don't understand the whole situation and we're having to educate them. So it's a massive educational process going forward here, but we think we're going to put a lot of them onto our out-of-scope solution.
And with the expected tax rate, that was not contemplated because that was related to one of the acquisitions that we have not completed as of then, so the reduction in tax rate we found after we close the acquisition, and as we were doing that due diligence.
