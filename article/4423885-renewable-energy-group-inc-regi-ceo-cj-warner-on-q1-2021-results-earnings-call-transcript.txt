I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Jacob Schwaegler with Investor Relations for Renewable Energy. Thank you. You may begin.
Jacob Schwaegler
Thank you, Devin. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.
With me today is REGâs President and Chief Executive Officer, CJ Warner; our new Chief Financial Officer, Craig Bealmear; and our newly appointed Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations, Todd Robinson. Todd Robinson will be discussing our financial results later in the call. So, I am stepping in today to assist in the role normally reserved for the Head of Investor Relations.
Let me cover a few housekeeping items before I turn the call over to CJ. First, I would like to remind everyone that this call is being webcast and is available at the Investor Relations section of our website at regi.com. A replay will be available on our website later this afternoon. The webcast includes an accompanying slide deck, which will appear automatically with the webcast, but you will need to advance the slides manually as we prompt you. For those of you dialing in, the slide deck along with the earnings press release can be downloaded from Investor Relations section of our website.
Turning to slide 3. We would like to advise you that some of the information discussed on this conference call will contain forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and assumptions that may or may not prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance. The Companyâs actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Many factors could cause or contribute to those differences.
These factors are described in detail in the Risk Factors and other sections of our Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are on file with SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements based on new information or revised expectations.
Todayâs discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these metrics will help investors assess the operating performance of our core business. Please see the press release or the appendix to the accompanying slide deck for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measure.
With that, let me turn the call over to our President and CEO, CJ Warner. CJ?
CJ Warner
Thank you, Jacob, and good afternoon, everyone.
Before we get into the discussion around first quarter results, I want to publicly welcome Craig Bealmear, REGâs new CFO to the team. Craig joined us just two weeks ago, bringing to REG a breadth and depth of the accounting and finance functions with specific senior experience in the world of refining and marketing. Some of you already have had a chance to chat with Craig, and heâs looking forward to meeting many more of you very soon. In turn, I would also like to thank Todd Robinson for serving us so well as interim CFO, and who will now become Deputy CFO, also retaining his responsibilities as Treasurer and VP, Investor Relations. These two strong leaders will help us progress our growth program with operational excellence, and their appointments demonstrate REGâs ongoing drive to build outstanding talent.
I am pleased to be reporting today on our strong first quarter results. One year ago, we reported in the midst of a market turmoil caused by the crude oil price wars, coupled with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though we are all encouraged now that the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel seems to grow brighter each day, we did continue to feel an impact on our operations and workplace as well as in our feedstock markets during the first quarter of this year. These conditions have been a stress test for REG and the bio-based diesel industry as a whole. We believe our results prove the strength and resiliency of our people, our business model and the strength of customer demand for lower carbon fuels.
As shown on slide 4, weâre pleased to report quarterly revenues of $540 million, net income of $39 million, adjusted EBITDA of $56 million and 134 million gallons sold. These results are a reflection of the REG teamâs capability and determination, and our continued drive to act and operate in line with our core values.
Slide 5 outlines the broad drivers of performance in the first quarter of 2021 as compared against first quarter 2020. First quarter 2021 faced several relative headwinds, not the least of which was that we remain in the challenging economic and social context of the pandemic, which had not yet taken hold during much of first quarter 2020. We also have the effect of the planned Geismar turnaround this year in first quarter. Risk management also shows up as a comparative headwind this quarter. Remembering back to first quarter 2020, there was a huge drop in crude prices experienced as part of the crude price wars and the initial onset of the pandemic with commensurate pressure on our margins, resulting in a large uptick in risk management as our system is designed to do. And finally, margins are down somewhat versus first quarter 2020. On the other hand, we were able to realize significant upside through commercial optimization and downstream performance, both of which also helped to drive increased RIN and LCFS associated profitability.
Letâs go into some of these factors in a bit more detail. We completed a 31-day turnaround at our Geismar, Louisiana facility in the quarter. The Geismar turnaround was successfully executed safely, on time and within budget. In addition to the 2021 planned maintenance and upgrade projects for the Geismar turnaround, our team completed two carryover projects from 2020 that we intentionally deferred last year due to the workplace challenges introduced by the early days of the pandemic. We believe the projects completed as part of the Geismar turnaround will increase our competitive advantage for years to come, including proprietary improvements that are intended to extend the time between turnarounds, increase annual throughput and decrease costs per gallon. Most importantly, this turnaround was completed with no recordable injuries or on-site COVID transmissions. In fact, weâre pleased to report no recordable injuries or known workplace COVID transmissions across our entire business in the first quarter. Our core value of safety always clearly guides the REG team as our total recordable incident rate, which includes any workplace COVID transmissions, shown on slide 6, remains below the pre-COVID industry average. As always, we are dedicated to continuous improvement and learning with a goal of reaching Vision Zero.
Another core value that guides us is a commitment to driving results. This focus helped us to achieve solid financial performance despite the external challenges I outlined earlier. Production was down versus first quarter of last year on a planned basis with respect to RD, which was down 8 million gallons due to the turnaround. As a reminder, the Geismar turnaround in 2020 took place in the early part of the second quarter. Biodiesel production at our European facilities was also down by 3 million gallons due largely to COVID-related international supply disruptions of used cooking oil and biodiesel production at our North American facilities was down 11 million gallons due to our continuing margin optimization efforts as well as unplanned downtime caused by the extreme cold in Houston and the Midwest.
Slide 7 shows the impact of these production declines had on our self-produced gallons. In contrast, gallons sold were off just 4% versus last year, and revenue was up 14%. The growth in revenue was generated by a significant increase in our average selling price for bio-based diesel, driven by an increase in D4 RIN pricing and to a lesser extent, ULSD year-over-year. While sales of self-produced RD gallons were down due to the turnaround, total sales of RD gallons were up driven by third-party gallons sold.
Sales of Ultra Clean, our proprietary BD RD blend continued to strengthen robustly, up 47% compared to the first quarter of last year, as shown on Slide 8. Both third-party RD sales and Ultra Clean sales enable us to capture additional margin both through RD and the BD that we blend with it. Overall, U.S. market demand for bio-based diesel continues to strengthen.
The chart on slide 9 shows petroleum product demand is still recovering from COVID, down 7% from Q1 2020 for gasoline and distillate and down 35% for jet. In contrast, even in this environment, bio-based diesel has continued to grow, with demand up 8% in 2020 versus 2019 and 1% in the first quarter of 2021 versus first quarter of 2020. As demand for bio-based diesel increases and actual and planned production ramps up, feedstock availability remains top of mind.
Feedstock prices continued to rise in the first quarter, as shown on slide 10, with soybean oil price being the primary factor. We believe there are many drivers behind this increase, including a harvest delay in South America, an increase in restaurant and food service demand for cooking oils and continued global supply uncertainty based on delayed impacts from COVID. I would also like to note our expectation is that higher prices will incentivize more soybean acres to be planted in the U.S. this year.
Forward market prices seem to support this expectation, as shown by the forward soybean curve on slide 11, which is significantly backward dated. Notably, the price differentials between soybean oil and waste-based feedstocks were better in first quarter 2021 than first quarter 2020, which we believe provided an optimization upside in the quarter.
Looking ahead, ethanol production is recovering, animal fat from meat production is projected to return to pre-pandemic annual norms and the soybean and canola industries continue to announce expansions of North American crushing capacity, which will increase vegetable oil production.
With that as a backdrop, let me quickly highlight our feedstock performance as a company. We believe that REGâs wide slate of available feedstock, best-in-class pretreatment capabilities and long-term supplier relationships are significant competitive advantages for us, and these advantages can be most valuable when the markets are volatile. Our data shows that we were able to capture our cost benefit versus the market on our slate of feedstocks used in first quarter production. The ability to pretreat different feeds and optimize the feedstock, including quickly adjusting the purchased feed mix is a key element to success in this area.
Slide 12 shows our updated feedstock mix shifting subtly from the fourth quarter of 2020 and clearly normalizing from the drastic changes required in the first half of last year when restaurant closures and lower ethanol production required a rapid shift to soybean oil.
In keeping with our history of regularly expanding our range of feedstock types and sources, we continue to pursue new and novel sources of feedstock. For example, in late March, we announced a strategic investment in CoverCress, as noted on slide 13. CoverCress is developing a new oilseed crop intended to be grown over the winter when fields would normally be shallow. We believe this cover cropderived from field pennycress could offer significant environmental benefits, including enhanced soil carbon sequestration and soil and nutrient retention and therefore, harmful and expensive runoff prevention. In addition, it produces an oilseed from which we expect to derive a high-quality, low-carbon intensity oil feedstock. We believe this developing crop and other cover crops like it offer promise as new environmentally beneficial and scalable sources of raw material for producing bio-based diesel. We are very pleased to be able to contribute to the efforts of this innovative company into fostering the potential commercialization of CoverCress.
Now, although feed prices ramped up substantially in the quarter, so did RIN values and, to a lesser degree, product prices. As shown on slide 15, because of the drastic increase in soybean oil prices, coupled with a less dramatic increase in heating oil price, the HOBO spread fell to a negative $0.87 per gallon for the quarter, a substantial decrease from first quarter 2020 HOBO spread of $0.29 a gallon. However, RIN prices responded accordingly, and the HOBO plus 1.5 RIN spread has continued to hold relatively steady at $0.92 a gallon, down just $0.05 versus first quarter last year. We never predict future moves in RIN prices, but we are encouraged by this trend of RINs functioning of a hedge to HOBO and working as designed to incentivize production to meet the RVO.
On the subject of RINs, we continue to hear that the EPA should be releasing the proposed 2021 RVO sometime this summer to be finalized later this year. And there continue to be positive developments on the state regulatory front. Washington state passed, both a clean fuel standard and a cap on trade policy, which is anticipated to begin in 2023. With our 100 million gallon nameplate, Grays Harbor biorefinery, we believe we are well positioned to help the state meet their carbon reduction goals. This major development, along with the biodiesel tax credit, RFS2 and other existing low-carbon programs, including Californiaâs, Oregonâs and British Columbiaâs continue to demonstrate support for growing demand for our fuel.
We are also seeing momentum in other states, including Colorado, Iowa, Missouri, New Mexico and New York. These states are all making efforts to pass legislation that increases the use of bio-based diesel. Outside of the U.S., the Canadian Clean Fuel Standard proposed for late 2022 is on track, and a separate proposal has been floated in Ottawa to raise taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. Market signals and regulatory activity continue to indicate the potential for an aggressive ramp up over the next decade.
Beyond regulatory support, we are continuing to see consumer demand pull fostered by their desire and by the desire in turn of their customers to lower their carbon footprint. A growing number of commercial enterprises, municipalities and other institutions have been announcing significant decarbonization targets and are seeking solutions that enable them to meet their goals. As we have commented before, this is why we feel we are at an inflection point in an energy transition, moving from a primarily regulatory-driven push to a customer pull. With this strong backdrop, we continue to drive our growth strategy forward. A notable portion of this strategy is the Geismar expansion, which is progressing as planned. Our recent equity raise was an important step in this process. Todd will provide more color on the raise and on overall progress at Geismar in his remarks.
In addition to our plans at Geismar, we believe our downstream strategy will drive growth and margin capture. As I mentioned earlier, REG Ultra Clean continues to be a standout performer, growing rapidly year-over-year. Our downstream growth strategy ties in perfectly with the expansion at Geismar with the goal of providing returns on multiple fronts as it would give us more high-margin renewable diesel exposure and more of our biodiesel gallons of margin uplift through blending and placement in carbon incentivized markets.
In addition to the strong growth of Ultra Clean, we are seeing B100 continue to grow as a readily available and need to adopt sustainable solution. Through a partnership with Optimus Technologies, fleet customers in Iowa, Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts have begun the switch to 100% biodiesel, as shown on slide 16. Customer enthusiasm for this program has been positive. As they have been able to operate year-round even during extreme cold weather. Adoption of B100 can be done quickly with very low switching costs, and it provides one of the fastest paths to decarbonization.
Todayâs customers desire these types of products that benefit both the environment and the economy. As a pioneer and a leader in global sustainability, REG is proud to be a significant and growing part of this movement. As I mentioned, many businesses have announced significant carbon reduction targets and are seeking options and solutions required to meet those targets. And many of the hoped for solutions are not yet technically, let alone commercially available. We are proud to have already adopted a sustainable business model that reduces carbon substantially and does so now. As most of you know, we recycle waste products into clean burning fuels that enable our customers to significantly reduce their carbon emissions with arguably the simplest and lowest cost of available options.
Slide 17 shows our environmental net contribution of over 800,000 metric tons of reduced carbon emissions for first quarter 2021. This carbon reduction profile will be highlighted in detail in REGâs second annual ESG report, which will be released soon. We are proud of our sustainable track record, are energized by our plans for the future, and we stand right here right now to meet the needs of the low-carbon economy of scale.
Now, Iâll turn the call over to Todd to review our financial performance for the first quarter. Todd?
Todd Robinson
Thank you, CJ, and good afternoon, everyone.
Slide 18 shows our first quarter results. As CJ mentioned, we had a strong first quarter. First, revenue increased 14%. This increase was mostly driven by higher average selling prices, including RINs. North American biodiesel, in particular, experienced a significant boost in average selling price, up 38%. As a reference, RIN prices were up $0.73 per RIN, over 158%, while ULSD prices were 14% higher versus first quarter of 2020. The increase in average selling price was partially offset by a lower volume of gallons sold. Gallons sold declined slightly versus last year, down 4%. This was in line with our guidance based on the turnaround at Geismar. REG produced renewable diesel sales were down slightly because of the turnaround, and we optimized our sales by routing more products to Norway. European biodiesel sales were down significantly due to increased lockdowns, which impacted both, feedstock availability and fuel demand.
Finally, as CJ mentioned earlier, first quarter adjusted EBITDA at $56 million beat guidance. This outsized beat was a result of multiple factors: lower realized feedstock costs than we forecasted; higher RIN values; more RINs monetized as we continue to optimize margin capture across our network; and lower risk management loss. As you may recall from last quarter when we provided guidance, we anticipate building RIN inventory in Q1 for a variety of reasons, including a short-term lack of liquidity in the RIN market due to Houston being shut down from the winter storm, a large number of RIN traders and buyers are located in Houston. RIN values increased after we provided guidance and liquidity returned to the market. We took advantage of this to monetize more RINs and reduce the RIN inventory build.
Q1 adjusted EBITDA was down compared to the $89 million of adjusted EBITDA we produced in the first quarter of 2020. The largest factor leading to the decrease was a $55 million negative swing in risk management. As a reminder, we recognized a $54 million risk management gain in the first quarter of 2020 due to the historic drop in ULSD prices last March. Our risk management strategy functioned as planned to counter that drop and also because of the timing factors, pulled some profitability from second quarter 2020 into first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we captured $18 million more profit from RINs and LCFS credits in Q1 2020 versus Q2 -- Q1 of 2020, excuse me.
SG&A expenses were up $4 million, driven by an increase in legal and professional-related expenses, higher stock compensation due to the increase in our stock price, larger vacation accrual due to COVID-related deferrals of time off and a higher bonus accrual. SG&A was flat last year as a percentage -- was flat to last year, as a percentage of revenue.
Slide 19 shows trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, and slide 20 shows our trailing 12-month return on invested capital. Note that Q2 2020 is included in the trailing 12-month number, where adjusted EBITDA was only $6 million due to the pandemic. As I mentioned earlier, much of the risk management that covered Q2 2020 performance was realized in the first quarter of 2020. Because of this impact and to better illustrate our outlook and how low -- how that low quarter is currently affecting the trailing 12-month result, weâve calculated a pro forma trailing 12-month view based on the low end of our second quarter 2021 guidance, which CJ will discuss shortly. As a reminder, our internal threshold for growth project is above 20% internal IRR and our target of ROIC is above 15%. And based on our second quarter guidance, we expect to be back above 15% return on invested capital.
We did recognize a small tax expense in the first quarter. And going forward, we expect our tax rate to continue to be less than 5%. Our blended average interest rate continues to be low and is currently less than 4%.
Now, letâs turn to the balance sheet, as shown on slide 21. As of March 31st, we had over $600 million in cash and marketable securities when you include the long-term portion of marketable securities. Obviously, our cash position has been bolstered by the recent equity raise. The equity raise was an important part of our planning for Geismar as we secured $365 million in cash, net of fees. We remain on track to reach a final investment decision soon, and we are submitting permit applications to the normal course of the project. We have strong support from the local community and the state of Louisiana for Geismar Train B.
Recall, the 2021 Board approved CapEx in keeping with our capital allocation, included roughly $20 million for safety, reliability and asset integrity; roughly $30 million for high-return rapid payback projects; and another $30 million on engineering for Geismar and other future growth projects. In addition to our CapEx budget, the framework also contemplates funding of potential strategic projects and acquisitions.
We had three convertible bondholders submit conversion notice recently, so we settled two in March and one in April with $28.3 million in cash for the principal and approximately 2.3 million shares for the premium. In addition, we provided a notification to our bondholders that we will redeem all outstanding 2036 convertible senior notes on June 15, 2021, again, settling the principal with cash and shares for the premium.
Now, I will turn the call back over to CJ to discuss the second quarter outlook.
CJ Warner
Thanks, Todd. I will now discuss our second quarter 2021 guidance as well as a general outlook for the year ahead. For context, Iâd like to touch once more on the current market environment, specifically with respect to feedstock prices. Current prices, especially for soybean oil are higher and more volatile than the market has seen since 2008, and any forecast must be made with caution in respect to these price movements. Having said that, we are confident in our optimization abilities and have strategies and approaches that seek to enable us to operate profitably in these conditions. This includes our multi-feedstock capabilities and the optimization upside that offers. As a reminder, typically, over 75% of our feedstocks are lower CI waste-based material.
With that in mind, letâs turn to the numbers, as shown on slide 23. For the second quarter, we are targeting adjusted EBITDA of $65 million to $85 million, with gallons sold in the range of $155 million to $175 million. This equates to an estimated first half adjusted EBITDA performance of between $120 million and $140 million, and gallons sold estimate roughly between 290 million and 310 million. This guidance includes $14 million of estimated risk management gain for the quarter as of April 26th.
For the full year, we are targeting gallons sold in the range of 630 million to 670 million gallons, down slightly from 660 million to 700 million gallons to reflect our lower production in first quarter. We expect to produce 470 million to 500 million gallons, which is down from 490 million to 520 million gallons for the same reason. Of course, any changes to ULSD prices, margins, RINs or LCFS credit values or level of market volatility through the end of the quarter could affect actual results. Shipment timing could also affect timing of revenue recognition.
Our strong performance in the volatile first quarter gives us added confidence as the U.S. economy appears to be returning to something closer to normal. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on our strategy as we pursue long-term growth in renewable diesel, combined with near-term tactical growth in the downstream.
The world today is undergoing a profound and exciting energy transition intended to put us on a path to environmental and economic sustainability. REG has an important and growing role in this effort. Our fuels can drive this transition today right now, offering substantial carbon and emission reductions with drop in fuels that require little to no change in infrastructure, operating costs, or customer investment. Our feedstocks are 100% renewable and support both the ag economy and the circular recycling economy. Wise government policies are encouraging the energy transition while the private markets are realizing the benefits we offer today. We have never been more excited about our growth prospects and look forward to creating meaningful value for our customers, employees, shareholders and all of society.
And with that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Devin for the question-and-answer segment of our call. Devin?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with ROTH Capital Partners.
Craig Irwin
Good evening. And thanks for taking my questions. Most important, I guess, is the RINs sold from inventory. So, you did kind of say in there more RINs were monetized. But, can you spell out in some detail sort of what the inventory position was at the beginning and end of the quarter? And how much more of an inventory are we talking about this quarter?
Todd Robinson
Yes. Hey, Craig. Todd here. Thanks for the question. Yes, we figured this would be a topic of conversation. So, yes, when we gave our first quarter guidance back in February, we indicated $25 million value kind of at the end of first quarter, based on our forecast. And again, based on my comments, we were able to monetize more RINs and obviously, prices were a lot higher in the quarter. So, we were able to take advantage of that to some extent. If you look at what prices were when we gave guidance, I think they were around $1 per RIN. And then, if you look at what they averaged in the quarter, I think it was closer to like $1.20 or something like that. And then, certainly in March, they were even higher than that, like around $1.40. So, we were able to monetize more than what we forecast. So, our inventory build didnât get to that $25 million at the end of first quarter as we anticipated.
Craig Irwin
So, just to clarify, does that mean that there was a $30 million to $35 million benefit in the quarter from selling those RINs, or did you exit the quarter with a greater RIN inventory than where you began it?
Todd Robinson
No. So, it was quite a bit lower than that $25 million number, Craig. It was probably around $16 million at the end of the quarter on an actual basis.
Craig Irwin
Okay, excellent, excellent. And then, second question, can you maybe discuss how you handle inventory, and inventory gains on feedstocks that you own? Was there any change in accounting here? And is there anything that we need to understand as far as inventory carried from the fourth quarter into the second quarter?
Todd Robinson
Yes. Craig, Iâll take this. And then, just to be clear, given that we got several analysts, we need to just kind of limit it to one question for each analyst. And then, if you want to, you can get back in the queue. So, yes. So, feedstock prices obviously are a topic recently. And with the run-up in soybean oil, obviously, thatâs been a hot topic. So, yes, usually, when we think about risk management, gains and losses, itâs usually driven by ULSD prices. But recently, with the rapid rise in soybean oil prices, we have seen, probably I would suggest a disproportionate amount of risk management impact from soybean oil prices. So, we have seen some risk management gains associated with our book, as we lock in those cash margins at the time of sale.
Craig Irwin
Okay. But that was -- that differs a little bit from what I think you disclosed as the risk management gain in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about that?
Todd Robinson
Yes. So, we had a $2 million risk management loss in the quarter compared to that significant $55 million, $54 million amount in the first quarter of 2020. So, if you look at the $2 million risk management gain -- excuse me, risk management loss, about two-thirds of that relates to the second quarter. Otherwise, the rest is first quarter.
Craig Irwin
Okay. And then, during the first quarter, we saw feedstocks go vertical. So, you had a gain, but youâre recording a $2 million loss. Can you just tie that up for us?
Todd Robinson
Are you talking about forecasts, Craig? Are you talking about actual? Iâm sorry.
Craig Irwin
Letâs talk actual.
Todd Robinson
Yes. So, we had $2 million risk management loss with a big chunk of that -- with a sizable amount of that being risk management gains from soybean oil.
CJ Warner
Well, donât forget that, Craig, that product prices were escalating, which reverses risk management for product. And so, itâs a combination of both. And Iâm sorry, we really need to let somebody else in the queue, and weâll answer your questions after everybody else gets to go through. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Hi. I want to move to slide 12. And I know you donât give exact color codings. But, letâs assume for a minute, the green is soybean oil. Historically, it was only 25% or less than 30%. And then, COVID happened, everything else disappeared, and it became a big part of your feedstock. Now, if I look at the last bar, it looks like everything else is coming back. Soybean oil is shrinking. So, from the perspective of feedstock, I want to understand, do you see the situation normalizing where, letâs say, blue is used cooking oil and gray is distillers corn oil, those feedstocks are coming back and REG is going back to a situation where it was like 20%, 25% soybean oil, and the rest is lower CI feedstock?
CJ Warner
Yes. Hey Manav, thanks for the question. And absolutely, we are back on track with our normal feedstock mix, which is primarily waste based. And those differentials maintained their attractiveness versus soybean oil.
Manav Gupta
Okay. And one quick follow-up. Last quarter call, you talked about covered crops, alternate feedstocks, you had historically looked at new feedstocks. Can you talk about where REGI is moving with looking for newer feedstocks besides vegetable oils? And Iâll leave it there.
CJ Warner
Yes. Thank you. We look at new feeds all the time. In fact, this last quarter, we processed, I believe, over 14 different types. Some of them in smaller quantities than others as weâre learning, and going internationally for different sources. And of course, cover crop oil is one of the ones weâre working on because, although itâs not available commercially yet, we believe itâs got really significant commercializable potential for scale as well as significant knock-on environmental benefits beyond the significant one of making oil that could be converted into bio-based diesel. So, CoverCress was the one we chose to highlight this time and what weâve invested in just recently because of that potential. But we continue to look at novel feedstocks like LG as well as a wide variety of other types of waste oils procured internationally.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.
Ryan Todd
Maybe can I just follow-up on the last question there? I mean, as you think about -- you highlighted CoverCress here in the slide deck. I mean, can you give any more color on how youâre thinking about that? I mean, from a scale point of view, is that theoretically the scale -- is it applicable across just about anywhere that soy has grown? What are the obstacles that remain to scaling this up? Any idea what the potential -- like a range or a CI score would be for something like CoverCress? And would the cost -- would it be similar to other low CIPs? Anything more that you can give us on where thatâs headed?
CJ Warner
Sure, Ryan. Thank you for the question. This is an important area. And while CoverCress very exciting, itâs not the only cover crop. So bear in mind that each type of cover crop is going to have its applicability thatâs geographic as well as have better or worse possibilities between different types of crops, which is why you really want to look at a variety of things. CoverCress is being developed to grow in between a soybean and corn cycle. So, itâs particularly well suited for the Midwest. And other cover crops are looking at potentially being planted between, say, cotton crops and -- some of them refer more arid climates and others are for wetter and hotter climates. So, thereâs a variety of different types of crops that are suitable.
But, the reason I go to that point is that it illustrates that a cover crop can be used in multiple areas in between multiple crops, which makes it particularly scalable. And because it has these knock-on environmentally beneficial effects, and theyâre actually economically beneficial as well for the farmer because they do prevent the soil runoff, the need to purchase additional fertilizer, they enable the farmer to actually process more or a lower carbon-intensive way and they enable them to monetize when they would otherwise simply just have a raw expense to plan to cover crops. There are multiple benefits, both from as social as well as an environmental standpoint. They donât have additional land use implications because they are planted between crops, which makes very good candidates for very low CI scores. We donât have specific scores to share at this point, but I think one can assume that theyâre going to be classified very closely to many of our other low CI waste-based feeds.
Ryan Todd
Thanks. Thatâs really helpful. CJ, maybe can I just ask a follow-up on one of the earlier questions as well? I mean, I appreciate the guidance that you gave, some of the color that you gave around the RINs inventories. But, as we think about your Q1 results versus the guide that you had given for Q1, outside of the delta and RIN inventories and pricing, what were the biggest -- any color on what were the biggest meaningful drivers of the outperformance relative to your prior guidance?
CJ Warner
Yes. I mean, Iâll let Todd embellish as needed, but thereâs a significant factor associated with optimization, and in particular, feedstock costs.
Todd Robinson
Yes. I think, Brian, one thing to think about is, weâre booking sales at opportune times, not necessarily pro rata throughout the quarter. So, we will be opportunistic when we see the spreads widen, and weâll take advantage of that and book sales during then versus just straight through the quarter. So, being a little nimble helps in terms of optimization.

Our next question comes from the line of Bert Dons [ph] with Truist.
Unidentified Analyst
Could you maybe talk to the difference youâre seeing between U.S. and international markets for UCO, and maybe the ability for international markets to evolve over time?
CJ Warner
Yes. In Europe, UCO is treated a little bit differently than in the U.S. and itâs because their statutes are different. But used cooking oil-based biodiesel basically gets a double credit for renewability. And that makes it a very attractive product in that market. Having said that, this particular quarter was a tougher one in Europe because Europeâs gotten hit a lot harder by COVID and the shutdowns are a little bit more firm. And if you combine that with the fact that much of the UCO that Europe uses comes from Asia, and the shipping lanes and shipping volumes have been challenged over the quarter. We did reduce our volumes for the quarter, which Todd reported. But overall, the market is very attractive in Europe because of the RED II.

Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright.
Amit Dayal
With respect to the downstream strategy, could you talk about how you use this in the first quarter? And how you may use sort of that optionality, managing margins for the rest of the year during this volatile period?
CJ Warner
So, the downstream strategy is very exciting for us because it enables us to accomplish multiple things. Possibly, the biggest one is getting direct to that end customer, and enabling that end customer to decarbonize more rapidly. What weâve been learning every time we do it is there a level of enthusiasm for escalating their blending levels and taking on more either renewable or biodiesel continue to -- continues to grow. So, thereâs just a connection and a volume-enhancing approach and result from doing this.
But, the other thing that weâre able to do, particularly in the carbon incentivized market is expand the blending with biodiesel and renewable diesel. And thatâs our Ultra Clean approach. And Ultra Clean is a proprietary blend, which provides reliable, high-quality product and properties. And the two blended together actually give the best of both worlds because biodiesel actually has a high lubricity factor, which improves mileage, and renewable diesel has a very high cetane number, which is a very high-quality burning indicator. If you put those two together, you get excellent engine performance. And then, the two together also have really enhanced tailpipe emissions reductions from criteria pollutant standpoint.
So, thatâs why when we report the escalation of Ultra Clean diesel sales, we believe is happening because as we get our branded sales out in front of customers, their receptivity has been high. And of course, as we go downstream, we collect more of the rent along the value chain. And in our business, in particular, that means taking a higher share, if not the whole share of the incentives because the end consumer is typically not the obligated party. And so, the incentives arenât part of the proposition for them, they just want a high-quality, very low carbon-intensive fuel.
Amit Dayal
Understood. And on the feedstock again, do you think the feedstock volatility risk is higher or lower from here for the rest of the year?
CJ Warner
Well, itâs going to be an interesting market, as you can see from the forward curve, itâs pretty heavily backwardated. But there are a lot of multiple factors going on, including planting levels, harvest capability and the success or failure of that. And then, weâve got issues in China with swine fever again. So, thereâs a lot of unknown. And of course, with the recovery from the pandemic, the available supplies are going to move around as recovery takes place. So, I think itâs probably fair to say, we still have a measure of volatility in front of us. In which direction that takes us in terms of absolute price, itâs going to be interesting to follow. As I said, the futures market is making its view known through a pretty heavy backwardation. But, the thing to keep in mind is, regardless of whatever happens with feedstock prices, whatâs really important is a couple of things. For us, one is the differential between soybean oil and the lower CI feeds that we actually operate in greater quantity in abundance in soybean oil by a lot. And the other one is the way that the HOBO spread and the RINs work together. So, the reason youâre seeing the escalation in RIN price is because feedstock prices were going up faster than the heating oil price, suppressing that HOBO spread and the RINs come in to balance in order to make sure that the RVO gets produced.

Our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial.
Hamed Khorsand
I just wanted to understand from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing any pressures as far as being able to source any of your high-carbon intensity feedstock? And is that going to be contributing to further price increases on that front?
Todd Robinson
Yes. Hamed, Iâm not sure I caught the first part of that -- your question. Was it the increasing low-carbon feedstock prices?
Hamed Khorsand
The competitive pressures and being able to source it and also the pricing pressures that come from as well, the price inflation?
CJ Warner
Yes. Obviously, thereâs a lot of potential new entrants. Keep in mind that many of them are either 100% soybean oil or a higher percentage of soy than anything else. Having said that, for us, our multiple feedstock strategy, we have -- our finding serves us well. So, if one particular type of feed or one particular source become scarce, which obviously it did during the pandemic, which is a good example of this, we pivot to other feeds. And so, thereâs something about the combination of being able to pivot and be flexible, having a lot of different sources, and then having the deeper relationships that we have as being an incumbent with many of our suppliers being very, very longstanding suppliers, gives us confidence of our ability to continue to source and, in fact, continue to grow our sourcing, which weâve been able to successfully do now for the last 10 years at about a 23% CAGR. Helps us feel confident that regardless of some of the other issues that are going on, we will be able to continue to source successfully.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt & Company.
Matthew Blair
I thought that Q2 guidance [Technical Difficulty]. So, congratulations there. Could you break out what is included in this estimate for one, sales of RINs from inventory; and two, risk management gains and losses?
Todd Robinson
Yes. So, I think we noted risk management of about $14 million was in our second quarter guidance. Weâre not going to -- we donât want to get in the habit of providing that level of information around our RINs just because it does -- there is some competitive intelligence there in terms of what that is and how valuable it is. But, suffice it to say that the balance of the RIN inventory from the beginning of second -- excuse me from the beginning of second quarter to the end of second quarter is going to be about flat. So, itâs not -- again, the reason we had such a significant build in the first quarter is seasonality. So, some of you guys are new to the story. First quarter, weâre building inventory, finished goods as well as RINS. And then, generally, throughout the rest of the year, you donât see that. And by the end of the year, our RIN inventory is trading down.
Matthew Blair
And then, I just wanted to clarify [Technical Difficulty] is that your ending RIN inventory at the end of Q1, or was that the boost that we saw for the Q1 results?
Todd Robinson
Yes. I think you broke up there a little bit, Matt, but Iâll try to interpret what you were asking. So, yes, so what we indicated when we gave first quarter guidance back in February, we indicated we were going to have about a $25 million RIN inventory at the end of first quarter. That number ended up being lower than that because we were able to monetize more. So, itâs about $16 million on an actual basis at the end of this first quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Tsung with the Webber Research.
Chris Tsung
Itâs Chris on for Greg. How are you?
Todd Robinson
Hey, Chris.
Chris Tsung
A lot has been covered with regard to the feedstock price volatility [Technical Difficulty]. I guess, you mentioned earlier in the Q&A section that there are benefits of being nimble. But could we kind of see you guys deploy longer term contracts, you kind of isolate the volatility from [Technical Difficulty]
Todd Robinson
Chris, weâre having a hard time with you too. Operator, is there something happening that we canât hear the calls very well?
Operator
Itâs probably just cell service, sir.
CJ Warner
Now, what I think that he was asking a third-party supplies or longer-term contracts helped to reduce volatility. So, we are focused on having some longer-term contracts, and thatâs actually one of our targets to continue to increase. And at this point, we have about 30% of our feed in sort of those categories. Having said that, many of them are indexed. So, it gives us sourcing confidence. But, the reason we risk manage is because the pricing will still be indexed in order to protect the supplier and balance things out with us. I think that was what you asked. If we guessed it wrong, please repeat.
Chris Tsung
You got that right. Thatâs kind of what I was looking for. Thanks. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just to sneak in. Last quarter, you guys mentioned about pulling some maintenance forward into Q1 in addition to Geismar. Were you guys able to complete it by the end of quarter [Technical Difficulty] Q2?
CJ Warner
Yes. Everything that was planned for first quarter got completed. So, weâve been really pleased with that and are ready for a focused second quarter.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen & Company.
Jason Gabelman
First, on RINs. You mentioned that RINs should essentially compensate for the difference between soybean oil and petroleum diesel. Are you seeing that to the full extent now as soybean oil prices have rapidly increased? And if you assume that relationship is going to play out, is that something thatâs contemplated in your 2Q earnings guidance?
CJ Warner
Yes. You can really see from the charts that we shared, you can really see how the RIN price escalation has come in to pretty much stabilize at HOBO plus 1.5 RINs margin. And thatâs been pretty stable now for quite a while, which gives us a pretty good look as to what we should use for our assumptions going forward.
Jason Gabelman
Okay. Yes. Because that chart, which I believe is on slide 15, it looks like itâs just through the end of the quarter. Itâs tough to tell if thatâs capturing April and May, which saw some of the more rapid appreciation of feedstocks. And it seemed like the relationship broke down a bit, but Iâm not sure if maybe thatâs not the right interpretation of whatâs going on?
CJ Warner
Yes. If you get really granular, thereâs a lot of breakdowns in this whole curve that you see. And so, sometimes it takes a while for things to catch up. So, you need to give it a little bit more time to draw a conclusion. And youâre exactly right, thereâs been some pretty wild volatility, which is actually why we wanted to show that forward curve on soybean oil, because thatâs a pretty crazy shaped curve. And weâll have to watch. And as we said, we donât like to predict markets too much. But, history being our guide, you can kind of see how the market is functioning from a market fundamental standpoint. And at the end of the day, the obligated parties still need to achieve that RVO. So, the RINs need to come in and help make sure that that marginal gallon gets produced.
Todd Robinson
Yes. Remember, just -- itâs Todd. Remember, right, so thatâs soybean oil, right? And weâre running whatever, 75%, 80% of the low CI. So, we are seeing much better spreads for choice white grease, used cooking oil and the low CI feedstocks that we run.
Jason Gabelman
Yes, for sure. Understood. If I could just ask separately about the downstream integration initiative that you have. You announced selling B100 straight to fleet customers. Is that -- does an agreement like that essentially enable you to capture a majority of the regulatory benefits that you wouldnât otherwise be capturing? And whatâs kind of the opportunity set there to strike agreements with other fleets?
CJ Warner
Yes. It absolutely does because itâs a win-win. And weâre able to capture the incentives, which keeps us developing more, and theyâre able to get this rapid decarbonization. And when you think about these municipalities now starting to have zero carbon goals or significant carbon reduction goals, this is probably the cheapest way for them to do it. Itâs certainly an option thatâs available right now, whereas many of the things theyâre looking at are going to take a while to get there. And they donât have to retool and completely change their fleet over, and thereâs not a big infrastructure change. So, thereâs some real attraction there to being able to basically do what theyâre doing now, but 85% lower carbon. So, thatâs a pretty big win.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
And I had a quick one, CJ, you mentioned it looks like Washington is moving ahead. They could have their own clean fuel standards pretty quickly. In your opinion, how does that benefit and support the carbon price in California? Because we are hearing that too many projects are coming on. So there could be downward pressure on California carbon price. So, in your opinion, whether itâs Canada, Washington and some other states? How does it help support the carbon price and LCFS credits?
CJ Warner
Hey, Manav. Yes, youâre right in the sweet spot on that one. The more municipalities, states and others establish targets to take on more of these types of feeds or at least to decarbonize more rapidly, the renewable diesel and the biodiesel are available now. And in California right now, renewable plus biodiesel makes up over 50% of the credits that are earned, because theyâre available today. So, as you have new states coming in and they have the same mandates in the early days, when there is not much decarbonization, thereâs a little bit more of a wide variety of types of credits that are going to come into play. But that pull is there, and it signals the need for greater volumes. And itâs kind of predictable because you can see what the decarbonization level is each year. So, definitely, itâs very good news for our industry that Washington has passed these targets because one of the primary ways theyâre going to meet it is through more renewable and biodiesel consumption.
