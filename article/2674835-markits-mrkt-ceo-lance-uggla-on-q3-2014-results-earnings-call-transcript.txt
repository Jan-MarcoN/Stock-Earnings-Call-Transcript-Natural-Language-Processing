Welcome to the Markit Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Levine and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I would now turn the call over to Mr. Matthew Kolby, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Kolby you may begin.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks operator. Thanks to everyone for joining us today for Markit's third quarter 2014 results conference call. I'm joined here by Lance Uggla, Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Gooch, Chief Financial Officer. Following their comments, we will open up the call for questions.
As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the Investor Relations section of the Markit Web site. The press release and supporting documents can also be found on our Web site.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this call may include certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Okay. Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Markit's third quarter earnings call. Today I'm going to take you through the key business highlights for the quarter. Then I'm going to pass over to Jeff, who'll cover the detailed financials.
As I discuss each of our business segments, I'll also outline each of their key growth drivers. Overall I'm very pleased to report a set of strong quarterly results indicative of the solid platform that Markit has built over the last 11 years. So here are the results.
Year-on-year revenue has increased 13.1% or 11.1% on a constant currency basis to a quarterly record of almost 270 million. Of the 11.1%, 8.1 represented organic growth with 3% related to acquisitions. This performance was driven by all three of our segments with Solutions our strongest performer with year-on-year revenue growth of 26%.
Profitability have continued to improve with adjusted EBITDA up 14.5% year-on-year reflecting a strong operating performance across all segments and adjusted EBITDA margins were 47.3%. I'm really pleased with these results and in the context of our long-term financial objectives, weâve performed well. To remind you these goals are 5% to 7% organic growth, double-digit revenue growth overall including acquisitions and adjusted EBITDA margin in the low to mid-40s. Our results keep us on-track to meet these goals.
Let's turn to our business segments. I'm going to start with Information. This segment comprises 46% of our revenues and saw good organic growth of approximately 5%. The business which is largely based on recurring fixed subscription revenues delivered this performance through product enhancements and within our pricing data and services businesses, success in both the expansion of existing customer relationships, as well as the development of new customers. Over the next 18 months, in addition to ongoing product strategy, the Information segment will focus on three key customer growth strategies. Increased retention, cross-selling and customer base expansion.
Now I'm going to move onto Processing. Our Processing segment represents 27% of the revenues and we achieved solid organic growth up 9.4% year-over-year with strong volumes across derivatives and loans due to increased market volatility and higher than expected activity. We saw little impact from the shift to electronically executed and cleared trades and our strategic focus over 2015 will be on managing costs and growing our equities, loans and FX franchises.
Finally Solutions. Within our Solutions segment, we saw strong organic revenue growth from Enterprise Software and Managed Services. Total organic revenue growth was 13% and acquisition -related revenue grew by approximately 12% year-over-year. Solutions continues to grow as the proportion of our firm. Segment revenues were 24% of our overall revenues in 2013 but have grown to 27% today, a strong trend which we expect to continue.
I want to now tell you about two Managed Services that really standout, WSO services and On Demand. First WSO, as a reminder, WSO focuses on loan servicing and showed strong growth due to three drivers. New functional offerings, new customer wins and increased loan assets under management. Second, On Demand which is all about the design, build and hosting of financial Web sites in mobile applications. Web site maps are such competitive tools for financial services companies and we see continual requests for new applications and upgrades to the latest features and capabilities. This is driving strong organic growth in this business.
Now on to the Enterprise Software side. I want to highlight EDM which continues to be a key driver of growth. This product not only has a high customer retention rates, but also adds new customers every single quarter, making good progress globally in all regions. We continue to maintain our leadership position and as demand for data management grows, weâre well positioned to capitalize on it. We remain excited about the growth opportunities in Solutions where we see increased demand across both Managed Services and Enterprise Software. Our customers continue to face considerable costs, regulatory and compliant pressures and Markit is the leading partner to help the industry solve its challenges. Customers turn to us because weâre quick-to-market, analytical, have deep capabilities with data and have a proven track-record across both buy side and sell side. This will continue to position us well.
I now want to update you on our new KYC Service, thereâs been considerable excitement around this initiative which we launched in partnership with Genpact where a group of banks work with us to develop a Managed Service for the collection and administration of KYC an anti-money laundering data. This service is about securing cost efficiencies around client on-boarding by leveraging a single gold standard operational process across the industry. Exactly what a Managed Service is all about. The joint venture is progressing well and continues to build momentum. We announced yesterday that we now have over 600 buy side firms on the platform and are in discussions with a number of sell side organizations beyond the original design partners. Our expectations on the performance of KYC remain unchanged, as we see contribution to our top-line growing in 2015 and onward into 2016.
Now before I hand over to Jeff I just want to remind you of the five building blocks that are underpinning our growth across all three of our segments. These are; delivering products that drive customer efficiencies; second, capitalizing on the evolving regulatory landscape; third, building innovative products and enhancements to existing products; fourth, increasing our cross-selling and opening up new customer sectors; and finally pursuing acquisitions. We continue to see good opportunities in our acquisition pipeline and those that weâve completed this year thinkFolio and CTI are now integrated and performing as expected. As weâve discussed before, we take a very disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only go ahead where we see a clear opportunity to enhance shareholder value in a reasonable timeframe.
In summary Markit is very well positioned, our growth is fueled by regulatory change in the financial industry, continued pressures to reduce costs and the need to manage the risks associated with operating in complex financial markets.
Iâm going to hand over to Jeff.
Jeff Gooch
Thanks Lance. Now letâs get into the detailed results. As we move into our second reporting period as a public company, weâre showing organic growth in each segment excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements which are outside of our control for the first time.
Now turning to the summary financials. Revenue for the third quarter increased 13.1% to a record $269.7 million and by 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $126.8 million growing 14.5% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 47.3% due to margin expansion in our Processing and Information businesses partially offset by increased investment in Solutions. Adjusted earnings were $68.7 million up 6.2% year-over-year. This quarter was impacted by one-off tax adjustment which reduced adjusted earnings by $7.5 million. This non-cash adjustment was related to establishing a deferred tax liability associating with internally developed software.
Adjusted EPS diluted was $0.37 per share which is flat despite the increase in adjusted earnings, reflecting a higher diluted share count in Q3 last year. As a result the increased share price and a one-off tax impact on adjusted earnings. To aid clarity, weâve included in the appendix a summary of the share count movement for this quarter, and an overview of our outstanding share options to help frame future potential dilution of different share prices.
Moving to our year-to-date performance, revenues are up 12.7% to $793.7 million or 10.4% on a constant currency basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins maintained year-over-year. Adjusted earnings year-to-date was up 14.7% year-over-year even after the one-off tax impact in Q3. With adjusted EPS diluted of $1.14 representing growth of 9.6%.
Now letâs talk about components of our revenue growth on Slide 9, organic revenue growth for the quarter was 8.1%, bringing our year-to-date organic revenue growth to 7.5%. All three business segments contributed strong organic growth, which I'll discuss in further detail in our segment overview slides.
Our Q3 acquired growth was 3% resulting in constant currency revenue growth for the quarter 11.1%. Year-to-date constant currency growth was 10.4%. The positive impact from currency exposure in Q3 was 2%. Our Q3 revenue currency mix split was 69.2% U.S. dollars, 26.8% pound sterling and 4% from other currencies. Based on investor feedback, we've refined our FX reporting approach to show the FX impact formally for each of our segments, which I'll cover in later slides. This will enable you to understand the impact from FX more clearly rather than rely on the verbal management estimates that we used last quarter.
Now to our revenue mix on Slide 10. Our revenue mix remained broadly stable and is comprised of 94.9% recurring revenues of which 53.6% are from recurring fixed revenue contracts. 75% of our year-over-year revenue growth was in recurring fixed revenues. This growth was primarily driven by new business, but recurring fixed revenues also increased as a result of proactively moving a number of existing customers from variable to fixed contracts and in Information segment and our two acquisitions in 2014. With new rates to recurring fixed revenue contracts across the business remained strong at approximately 90%.
Slide 11 summarizes the movement in operating expenses. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased by $14.9 million or 11.7% from the prior year. Costs increased due to growth in our employee base as a result of new hires and acquisitions. And the focus of our new hiring has been in low cost locations.
Now I'll discuss the performance of our three operating segments. Starting with Information on Slide 12. This segment showed strong revenue growth of 6.8% or 4.8% on an organic basis for the quarter. The key driver was fixed income products within Pricing and Reference Data including CDS, loans, bonds and securitized product pricing. This reflected increased demand from bank and fund administration customers. Valuation and Trading Services revenue grew year-over-year and was impacted by the wind down of our Trade Reporting business in June 2014 and reduced revenue associated with Totem term-out which reflect last quarter.
Information organic revenue growth would've been 1.9% higher compared to Q3 2013 excluding these impacts. We saw good progress in use to all our products with two examples being the Totem service evaluation adjustments and our transaction cost analysis service. Our Index business continues to show growth compared to 2013 driven by PMI and bond indices. Efficiently, customer retention renewals remained strong and continues to be a focus for the Information Management team. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.3% with an expansion in adjusted EBITDA margin to 49.5% this quarter versus 47.1% in the prior year.
Now turning to Processing on Slide 13. Third quarter revenues were $72.2 million up 12.5% compared to the prior year quarter or 9.4% on an organic basis, continuing the strong performance of Q2. Our loans processing product grew as the loan market showed strong secondary trading growth partly related to higher fee low issuance. OTC derivative processing showed growth due to higher volatility driving volumes primarily in rate of products and also benefited from increased compression activity and one-off support from regulatory reporting. The segment demonstrated strong adjusted EBITDA flow through from increased revenue, with adjusted EBITDA up year-over-year by 21.1% with an adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. We did not see the revenue impact associated with SEC trading clearing in the quarter.
On Slide 14, we've laid out the potential future impact of electronic execution and clearing on our Processing segment. Nothing has changed here in regard to previous commentary we've made we wanted to lay out slides to aid clarity. Firstly, it's important to clarify that approximately 40% of our Processing segment is associated with loans, foreign exchange and equities, which we do not expect to be negatively impacted by new regulation. Revenue growth across these products has been low double-digits year-to-date.
To help clarify the size of the market that we potentially impacted, we think only the half our rates and credits revenue will be in scope over the next three years. However, we expect some of the revenues to be retained by providing connectivity reporting to SEC trades. Our conservative estimate is that the maximum potential reduction of revenue will be in the $50 million to $60 million range paved in over the next three years. We will actively seek to further mitigate this impact through, first growing the non-impacted asset classes, second offering new services such as FX options, third volume increases from electronic trading. We'll also seek to proactively manage cost going forward to minimize the EBITDA impact, currently about 50% of the CFTC regulated market new to SEC trading. We expect to see the impact of lower price points for these trades to take effect in early 2015 and we do not anticipate significant change for Q4.
Our Solutions segment on Slide 15, continued to show strong growth. Revenue was up 26.2% for the quarter compared to 2013. Organic revenue growth was 13.1% for the quarter bringing our year-to-date organic growth in Solutions to 18.9%. Growth was driven by new business wins across both Managed Services and Enterprise Software. Key growth products include On Demand, enterprise data management, WSO services, analytics and counterparty manager, all of which achieved double-digit growth year-to-date. We continue to see a strong pipeline for these products which represent a significant proportion of solutions revenues.
On a constant currency basis revenue was up 25.2% year-to-date with acquisitions contributing 12.1% associated with the CTI acquisition which closed on July 1st, Markit Corporate Actions and thinkFolio. Compared to 2013 adjusted EBITDA margins continued to be impacted by increased investments in new initiatives within Managed Services.
On Slide 16, I wanted to highlight one exceptional item impacted our IFRS GAAP accounts. The closure of our Credit Centre business within our Processing segment resulted in an impairment charge of $8.3 million related to the platformâs intangible assets. The decision to close Credit Centre was due to a slow adoption of electronic trading for OTC derivatives overall and in particular for the lack for demand for low latency central limit order book trading venues.
Moving to Slide 17, strong operating cash flows which were $278.8 million for the first nine months excluding interest and taxes enabled us to reduce our net debt despite having funded the acquisitions of thinkFolio and CTI in the nine months period. Overall leverage levels continue to remain low at 0.91 times last 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We also showed tight controls in capital expenditure in the first nine months of 2014 which totaled $88 million primarily related to internal software development costs, down 7.1% or $6.7 million from the prior year reflecting reduced third-party technology spend and reduced investment in office space.
A key part of the strategy for business growth is M&A activity. We continued to maintain a disciplined approach to M&A and weâll only act when see a clear opportunity to enhance shareholder value in a reasonable timeframe. Areas of particular focus and our valuation of potential targets include returns on invested capital and earnings accretion. We also need to have a strong belief that any deal would enhance revenue growth across the group.
Iâll now hand back to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Thanks Jeff. In summary I think weâve had a great quarter, I am very pleased with the way the business is performing. Looking across our business I believe that we have the right approach to take advantage of growth opportunity that will enable us to deliver on our long-term financial objectives. Thank you. Weâll now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets
I guess I wanted to ask about within the solutions business the organic growth slowed somewhat, I guess youâd lapped the one acquisition thatâs still inorganic for the rest of the year. But is that the primary reason or were there some other reasons that the growth there appeared to slow a bit relative to the first half of the year?
Jeff Gooch
Itâs Jeff here. I think the main reason for the slowdown in growth was really just timing on revenue recognition, as you know we donât try and manage the business quarter-by-quarter, so youâll hear a little bit noise up and down. If you look at Q3 we had less license revenue in Q3 than Q2 for example that was impacting the Q2 versus Q3 and in comparison to last year, that revenue license -- those licenses were a little bit lumpy. And also to have built the consulting revenues on summary particular year slightly lower than last year summer months but impacts the number a little bit as well. But I think we very much see that segment is on track, and itâs just a question of timing.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets
And then following on your comments on the KYC product, how big an opportunity is the buy side relative to the sell side? So there are 600 plus customers that is probably impressive but is that a much smaller revenue opportunity per customer that it will be when you get more of the sell side going and I guess is that really in line with your prior commentary as youâve said or is it likely that it could grow more than the moderate initial impact youâve been talking about previously?
Lance Uggla
Gary itâs Lance, Iâll take that question. So the key success factors to the client on-boarding platform is; one, to build the platform with the appropriate info security and regulatory positioning in terms of the on-boarding of customers of the sell side banks that are looking to gain a cost efficiency, hence why we call it a Managed Service. We're doing the same activity for many at the cost of doing it for few. That's one, so that's the biggest success factor and the top-10banks in the world spend a $1 billion on on-boarding client documents.
The second success factor that we think each platform is going to have and we feel, we have a great head start is the on-boarding of the buy side and that number is critical, it's very important, it's not about the revenue that that creates, it's about the fact that when you get those clients documents onboard, you create the Managed Service for the sell side institutions to participate in the cost savings. So, it's a very important feature, it's a great announcement and I'm pleased with our performance and we're on-track.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital
Just a follow-up on the Solutions segment there, so given the lumpiness of the license revenue, just wanted to get a feel for it, is the organic growth rate for the first half of the year more sort of the expectation of what you guys want to see through Solutions going forward?
Jeff Gooch
Yes Manav. I think you know last as I said to the Gary's question, that will always be a little bit lumpy, I think the nine months trend we showed here just under 19% organic growth. I think that shows an excellent trend, there will always be core key variations up and down with software implementations and licensing, but I think we're still very comfortable with the nine months to four months year-to-date. And even the analytics revenues were down in Q3 because of licensing. Year-to-date on the nine months highlighted a double-digit growth and first nine months of year so that business is in great shape.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital
And just to maybe flush out your comments on the M&A pipeline a little bit more, can you help us understand sort of the pipeline in terms of small versus larger deals, because I think in the past obviously you guys have done pretty consistently a bunch of the smaller deals and it seems like other than that CTI win we haven't really seen much, maybe just some color there?
Lance Uggla
It's Lance, Manav. The acquisition pipeline across all three segments is buoyant, there's lots of opportunity and we take a very disciplined approach in terms of looking at our acquisitions. So we'll maintain that discipline, whether the acquisition is small or large. We continue to access and look at very interesting assets, but we're not -- from a competitive perspective, we don't want to comment on things that we're working on.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs
First one just to know, how we should think about prior guidance of 5% to 7% organic growth for the year given your trimming or headed out for the nine months I think it was around 7.5%. And I wanted to know, but not necessarily updating that, are you implying some type of deceleration in the fourth quarter? Or should we just think that there may be some upside to that guidance?
Jeff Gooch
Yes Andre it's Jeff I mean that the 5% is fairly is still very much our guidance, it's long-term guidance. We're not looking to manage that number in a particular period, first nine months you're absolutely right we're somewhat ahead of those numbers, but I think over a full business cycle that's a good target for us to be at. We've had a good processing volume so far this year, I think we highlighted in my comments earlier we would expect that to be a little bit tougher next year, but generally speaking, yes, we think the 5% to 7% is a good range for us to live in it's where we have lived in for the last couple of years, I'd love to say we're above that, but I think nine months is great, but it's not long-term period there'll be ups and downs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs
And I think on the cost for the Processing business that actually looks like it came down quarter-over-quarter, I know you laid out a number of cost saving measures in the past including moving people offshore and rationalizing the technology, so should we assume that you're through those efforts and 3Q costs are good run rate or is there more room to go?
Jeff Gooch
I think there's a lot more room to go, I mean Brad and his team have done a great job on managing costs in terms of reducing headcount, moving people to India, looking at some of that technology costs, and that is an ongoing program we'll be working very hard on that spanning to two to three years as electronic trading comes in, I think that number also benefits a little bit from an exchange rate Q3 versus Q2 and sterling coming down a little bit that business is fairly London centric in terms of its staffing but I think that product cost discipline which we've demonstrated is something we're going to continue to focus on.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank
I am wondering can you provider us a few more details on where you're making the investments in the Solutions division?
Lance Uggla
So in terms of -- we really look at our investments in I guess probably three key areas with respect to Solutions. So one is, innovation and enhancements to our existing products. So weâre regularly looking to enhance existing products, I highlighted too in terms of On Demand and WSO but I think Jeff discussed several double-digit growers. A lot of that is coming from innovation and product enhancements to our products. The second big thing that weâre looking to do is cross-sell. And thereâs been some great examples in the quarter where weâd combined our analytics engine which is very strong at calculating CVA which is a credit value adjustment that sell side and buy side are needing to calculate. And we combined that with our data management platform EDM to combine to create a packaged offering for an asset manager which we sold in the quarter into Asia weâre building out a similar type of CVA solution for a tier-2 bank where weâre taking complete data management capability with our analytics engine to do global CVA calculation, so some investments in new product development where weâre generating cross-sell activity which is quite exciting. And then of course the new services like KYC, these are this year, next year these are the big investment years in the new service and weâd expect to see some revenue coming in â15 and then accelerating there forward.
Jeff Gooch
And one thing Iâll add Lanceâs answer is, when you look at margin for Solutions in Q3 itâs just under 33%. I think I made this comment last quarter as well thatâs very much influenced by the investment in some of those big new initiatives KYC, and the launch that we just announced, a collaboration and a few other items where we have been making a big investment. If you stripped out those three investments products plus the acquisitions weâve done during the year is actually the ramp-up I would say the margin for the rest of the Solutions division is already over 40%, so I think that we are very pleased with how the established partner division and performance there. But we are allowing the margin to come down, because we like the opportunities to have a lot of service.
Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank
And I was looking at the transition of clients from some of your variable contracts some of the fixed contracts. Is that process largely done or can you give us just the range of where you might be in terms of completing that transition of clients on to the fixed contracts, within Information?
Jeff Gooch
So I think I mentioned on the call last time, we migrate the number of Totem clients Q4 last year and that was impacted some of our comparatives for this year. Weâre not currently migrating additional customers. My guess is we might do a few more beginning of next year but a much smaller number than we did. So I think largely thatâs through the numbers at this point.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous
First question for me is can you give bit of a detail on how youâve progressed in cross-selling in the quarter?
Jeff Gooch
Yes Vincent I think weâve highlighted that as being a big focus to the firm this year. I think weâre looking at two types of cross-selling effectively one is introducing different products to existing customers. And for example weâve sold below the price we have had enterprise data management software to existing data customers, and weâve signed over half a dozen contracts to result that initiative so far this year. And that is just one example of backhaul and cross-selling. The other thing which Lance mentioned earlier as well is we are looking at how we can bundle up different products to create an attractive client proposition, so itâs another form of cross-selling and weâve had some success in Asia already with bundling, analytics capability to credit valuation adjustments with the enterprise data management software to bring data into that solution and providing a credit pricing, unique to that calculation is one solution. Weâve signed our first customer there, we have a great pipeline. Just both going cross-selling are starting, I wouldnât say we have cleared a number of our results yet but that certainly be best to making sales particularly in the first half of the year after the payout.
Lance Uggla
One thing I might add to that is our suite of equity products where weâve seen a substantive set of cross-selling across our TCA commission manager broker vote products, and there our equity sales team has really ramped up their cross-selling initiatives and we expect to see a continuation of that going forward.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous
And just moving on to Processing, so itâs clear that the take up of SEC in the electronic order booking rates is still very slow, especially compared to credit derivatives and part of the reason for that would be because counterparties still like to trade by voice, theyâre doing large offset bulk trades and all these non-standard pending swaps to avoid trading on SEC. So given the slow take up so far, what are the chances that this continues and OTC reform just doesnât hit you at all?
Lance Uggla
No our view is, is that the regulation overtime will take place and the transition has been a lot more gradual than we had expected, but we've laid out the worst case scenario which we feel can be impacted by timing, volumes and trades as well as our ability to continue to grow the other products at a double-digit rate, that will minimize that impact overtime. But we as a new company, we want to put a floor on it and then our job is to look to perform well against that.
Vincent Hung - Autonomous
And then the last question, you mentioned Processing benefited from the high volatility levels this quarter and I look at letâs say the move index right now spiked up a bit in October, I guess this is kind of Q4 question one is, how should we think about the sensitivity of the Processing revenues to high volatility levels? And I guess, in October can you give us a bit of an update so far as to what you've seen?
Jeff Gooch
I think generally speaking, volatility where it leads to high transaction count as of a very unique approach through to our revenues in Processing and yes, so this quarter that drops through the bottom-line pretty quickly. And this volatility is relevant to our product. So uncertainty around interest rate outlook for example is clearly very positive, volatility in the equity market doesn't really show quite the same flow through. But certainly towards the end of Q3, we still have lot of, our degree in terms of October that month is definitely characterized by continued volatility and we'll see where the rest of year breaks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Sara Gubins from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, this is David Chu for Sara Gubins. So how confident are you in that the $50 million to $60 million impact for Processing will be up for?
Jeff Gooch
I mean David I think, there's a lot of factors that go into calculation where a lot signals to me would say you can never guarantee to see an outcome. But I think consistently we've made estimates about how big the impact will be? How quickly it would happen? And the reality has been somewhat more positive than that outlook. Yes, so I think the 50 million to 60 million if nothing else changed for the positive and electronic trading come in that's probably our best estimate of where the impact would be. In reality we're clearly looking to mitigate that through the things I mentioned earlier. There's a lot we can do in terms of growing loans, FX and equities. We've double-digit growth in those asset classes this year, we have multi-shares to tape the low markets and the growth sides, the things we can do there.
Clearly we can do a lot in terms of product development. We have FX options to a couple of months back we have more to do there. And so it's big unknown we left electronic market themselves and what happens in terms of trade volumes. Most of the electronic markets have resulted in increased volumes so that will be a very significant mitigate of that 50 million to 60 million numbers but too early to call. As in one of the earlier question said so far most electronic trading has really been U.S. marketing there is no volume impact from that, we've got nothing really to assess it with. And finally as the worst comes to us, part of the thing we are doing a good job on cost of Processing, there is a lot more we can do there in terms of location that tell us to utilize over the next couple of years. So I would hope that that really is a very conservative action of what happens in realty but no guarantees in line.
David Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
And what are you seeing from the DTCC consortium and Thomson Reuters and their launch of their KYC service?
Lance Uggla
Well of course as good competitors we're keeping an eye on them. And but as I've said in the past, I think we have the benchmark solution. We'd added significant customers, we're up and running, we've engaged Mandiant in terms of information security Carmen Chaw the law firm around our regulatory implementation. I really do think that we built the leading products in this space and we are happy to have competition it just shows our product off even better.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.

Staying on the Processing part story to hop on that one but and thanks for the slide and I think you commented several times in it, but when you think about this revenue impact 50 million to 60 million one, in your budget like how do you think about you think saying phasing over three years I mean is it fair to say that it should be a gradual phase in so let's call like 20 million a year is that kind of how are you thinking again related to that you talked about the expense potential the lowering of expense potential I don't think you gave a magnitude so can you maybe talk a little bit about how much you can push cost down over that same timeframe?
Lance Uggla
So I'll take another shot at this one back and forth here Jeff and I but the what I like about working with Jeff and the team is they have laid a nice floor out for you and I like that because we laid that out at IPO, we haven't moved off of that, we've outperformed story but that is the appropriate floor. Now weâve laid out very clearly that there are three potential further mitigants that could reduce that number. And I am happy for you to put the numbers you want on it but it doesnât change my overall forward-looking guidance of 5% to 7% double-digit with acquisitions, low to mid-40. Thatâs what weâre operating on and we operate on that with the impact of electronic trading in our sites. Weâre growing loans, equities and FX at double-digit all three of them, thatâs a good thing.
Two, new FX option service, another good thing. Three, trade volumes electronic versus voice, we can put an estimate on that and yes we could put some number of five trades to one, 10 trades to one, 20:1 and show you a number that shows we got upside. But we really donât want to do that because we donât know and weâre in this long-term. You have to remember we are equally shareholders for 30% of the upside of the firm post the options strike. And we have to get this right and weâre very comfortable, I love this business, itâs sticky, itâs middleware and electronic market demand more middleware. So I think we got great mitigants.
Finally Brad and David Legg and the team that run our Processing division, they are top flight, these are the best guys in the business and if they have got to get some additional costs down in the future it will be done. There is no doubt about it. So I like this business, we have laid it out, we donât change our story, thatâs the story Jeff put another slide in this time, thereâs nothing new to report.
Alex Kramm - UBS
And then maybe secondly one of your competitors, ICE if you look at them as a competitor obviously they are also a customer to some degree. But they recently bought SuperDerivatives and if I am correct I think you looked at that business over the years as well. So just wondering how you think -- it does any impact on your business in terms of maybe a bigger competitor and owning kind of like a similar pricing business of may be similar to your Information business or maybe you are losing them a little bit a customer any sort of thoughts you have on that acquisition in the space obviously since it was a decent size one?
Lance Uggla
Yes I think we looked at SuperDerivatives many times historically, so we know the business, we compete. ICE is led by a great CEO, Jeff Sprecher, they have a great team, theyâre a good strong competitor and weâre happy to compete against them. You have to remember in financial information and services companies especially around data assets, there is generally a primary and secondary provider and we love being the primary, sometimes weâre secondary thereâs not a big difference behind that between the two. Sometimes there is a third provider that is the cover service and there is lots of scope in the markets we operate in for growth and there is lots of room, SuperDerivatives has been there before, theyâre still there. Could ICE invest more than they had they could do on themselves definitely but we feel confident in our own product and services and our capability of delivering those services to our customers, weâve been in this game for a long time and we have a very-very strong position.
Alex Kramm - UBS
Maybe just a very quick one for Jeff, FX you gave the revenue breakdown. Could you give it to us on the expense side as well so we can think about the margin impacts as currencies have been moving a lot here? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
I will be happy to give you that the split of expenses by currency and putting up the number now. So if you look at the total group, in terms of U.S. dollars 55% of our expenses are in U.S. dollars, in terms of sterling it was 32.5% and then other currencies are around 4.2% at the tail of your currencies mainly in Asia-Pac where we have offices and expenses. So we are probably just over $0.5, we are probably slightly more sturdy, or in fact you get the head office in London, perhaps the split in terms of expense currencies.
Lance Uggla
So say that again to be clear, dollar is 55.7%, sterling is 32.5% and the string of small currencies making up the rest.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley
You mentioned 98% renewal rates across the business. Is there a noticeable difference in any of the three segments? And you mentioned a few times in the earlier comments that youâll focus on retention in the Information segment. So were there any specific issues there this quarter?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, so I think we quote a 90% number through recurring split contract we can get a clean comparison with the customer renewed along and they renewed at. Itâs a particular process of focus for Information because thatâs the division the majority of fixed contracts. I think it has been a focus for us through this year I think on the last quarterly call I commented on an improvement in retention rates in Q2. Weâve maintained that improved level in Q3. If you look at the divisions what you tend to find for the fixed contracts is processing solutions fixed contract is incredibly sticking in that very high renewal rates. Information is obviously is a little bit less sticky with a fair amount of about 90% number. So given Information is a bulk of it the firm average comes out around about 90%.
Lance Uggla
One thing I'd like to add to that Toni is our whole account management strategy that we have put in for cross-selling, one of the things that that team is very focused on as well as the cross-selling is the working to try to generate an additional percent on retention and that's a real positive for the overall business. And so if they can do that, that's great. They're up for the challenge in that new account management structure that we have put in place globally should add, should be what we'd like to do is improve our retention rates and therefore draw in some additional revenue and that was why the comment was made.
Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley
And separately I imagine a lot of your customers are going through their budgeting process for next year directionally in your conversations with them, are you getting the sense that budgets are higher or lower or just comparable to 2014? Thanks.
Lance Uggla
Yes, so I think fairly unchanged we don't think they're going to be necessarily up or down from our perspective we've seen a pretty steady and balanced view out of our sales teams with respect to 2015 activity. So we'd expect more of the same and in line with our guidance.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from George Mihalos from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse
I was hoping to maybe ask a cross-sell question from a bit of a different angle. If we look at the 8% organic growth you guys put up this quarter, how much of the contribution was from new customers, customers that did not have any contracts with Markit compared to obviously your cross-selling efforts?
Lance Uggla
Yes, I don't think -- I don't have that number. We could come back to possibly, I don't have that number but what I can tell you is that we've had significant new customers into the firm year-to-date and significance more than 100, and we have done a great job on cross-selling and we've given you some good examples of that in this call. But I don't have a breakdown George of that overall growth piece in front of me.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse
Would you say they are tracking sort of in line with your expectations or maybe better just sort of qualitatively, if you could?
Lance Uggla
Yes, I'm extremely pleased with our teamâs results Shane Akeroyd runs our sales team globally is a very-very number focused sales manager with a math degree as a background. So he is very focused on the numbers, very focused on our key initiatives for cross-selling for selling the new products with enhancements and building out our new product development opportunities that where we're taking EDM and adding to analytics or we're taking broker vote commission manager and TCA and marrying them together into a more common platform, and they're doing a great job. I don't have the exact breakdown but qualitatively I'm pleased and it's in line with expectations.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse
And then maybe shifting gears a little bit to the margins on the Solutions side, Jeff is this sort of the margin on run rate sort of the low 30s that we should be thinking about going forward given continued investment in the business or do you think there is a long-term margin expansion opportunity looking at the Solutions segment?
Jeff Gooch
Yes it probably comes down to your definition of long-term. I think the next couple of years we'd like the opportunities in that space, I think we're going to continue to invest. So you will see a bit margin movement up and down, but I donât think we will see a big migration in margins. I guess in the very long term, the existing products show very strong margin characteristics and at some point you achieved this sort by that organic investment then you'd see fairly rapid margin expansion. But so I guess one day you might make that choice but at the moment they are just seeing through soft pressure all our customers to reduce cost and comply with regulations back clearly managed series and software is a great place to be. So I think for the next few years, we will continue to make investments in that space to see those opportunities.
George Mihalos - Credit Suisse
And just last question from me, sort of a housekeeping item. Just want to make sure I understood it on the Information side some of the re-pricing of contracts that will anniversary this quarter to fourth quarter of '14?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, we made the change in Q4 last year, so I guess our first completely clean quarter will be Q1 next year in terms of the comparative. I guess in detailing out fundings in Q4 get s9ome of them in the quarter. But broadly speaking I think we still feel a little noise in our next quarter and then Q1, it will be a clean comparison as we do commercially next year. But I think the big change is real one-off event I am not anticipating anything of that scale for next year. But generally there will be a lot of moving pieces of the fixed contracts.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets
Just one quick follow-up, obviously we know that M&A is a key part or your strategy overtime but how important is it to you the limit dilution from equity comp and the impact that will have on earnings per share? I know youâve talked about having historically done some buybacks. So I think a lot of that was more liquidity driven when you were a private company getting liquidity to employees. Are you likely to think about using some of your free cash flow for share repurchases going forward and how do we weigh the benefits to that versus M&A? Thank you.
Jeff Gooch
I think first thing to clarify is that the bulk of the buybacks weâve done in the past have actually been from non-employee shareholders, we run number of events for employees to the dollar spend most of that dollar is gone to the non-employee shareholder. So weâve always viewed it as a great way to add value to the ongoing shareholder base. Definitely part of the talk here, weâre not planning to do anything at the moment but clearly weâd expect good cash inflow from option exercises and employees exercise options that will give us an arsenal to think about. Given our low levels of leverage we need to find accretive M&A opportunities which have a great landscape and resonate which Lance talked about earlier. But share buybacks have a role to play and we will consider that. I think to be honest we will have to be small free flow at the moment, because we feel the right time to buying back stock but that at time we will probably come in the next few years next in, and clearly what we donât want to do is allow annual compensation to create long-term dilution to shareholders.
Operator
Thank you. And I will turn the call over to Mr. Lance Uggla for closing remarks.
Lance Uggla
Well thank you very much everybody for the set of questions and for participating in our second set of results. I am sure you can see Jeff and I and the team are going up the learning curve as fast as possible, but I remain pleased with our results. I think we had a strong quarter, weâve maintained our perspective on a go forward basis in terms of the organic growth acquisitive growth and EBITDA margins and that remains intact and we look forward to the completion of 2014 and the next set of results. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes todayâs conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.
