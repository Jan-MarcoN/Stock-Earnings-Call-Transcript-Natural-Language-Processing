Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IMS Health First 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, May 3, 2016.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas Kinsley - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Planning
Thank you, Kelley. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss IMS Health's first quarter 2016 performance. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on the Events & Presentations section of our Investor Relations website. A link to the Investor Relations website is located in the lower right-hand corner of our company's website, imshealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, May 3, 2016.
Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are, in fact, achieved will depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
During this presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, unlevered free cash flow and gross leverage ratio. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance.
In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material non-cash, unusual, or non-recurring items and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
With that, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining our 2016 first quarter earnings call. As you know, we announced some great news this morning and we are very excited about it, but obviously we still have a business to run, so this call will focus on reviewing our Q1 earnings.
Because there is so much else going on this morning, we'll keep our prepared remarks and the Q&A period somewhat crisper than normal; however, our investor relations team will be available as normal to take your follow up questions after the call.
I'm pleased to report that our first quarter of 2016 is another quarter of consistent strong performance at IMS. Let's review the numbers. For the quarter, revenue grew 25% at constant currency. Tech services revenue was up 46% and Info up 9%.
Adjusted EBITDA growth was about 9.5%. Of course, this growth rate included the Cegedim acquisition as well as a primary market research acquisition we closed earlier this year AlphaImpactRx. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, revenue grew 7.2% at constant currency driven by 15.8% growth in tech services and information revenue grew about 0.5 point. The tuck-in acquisitions contributed just over half of the core 7.2% revenue growth. Most of these acquisitions were in Technology Services and they represented less than half the 15.8% core tech services revenue growth. So organic tech services growth continues to be solidly in the high single digits.
Emerging markets revenue increased 28% and developed markets grew 25% at constant FX. And if we exclude Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx, revenue grew 10.6% in emerging markets and 6.5% in developed markets, again at constant foreign currency rates. We have a number of important wins during the quarter. A couple of examples include a deal with a top pharma that will combine the strength of IMS Real-World Evidence information, technology and services. Under this new multi-year contract, the client will gain broader access to anonymous patient level Real-World data. The client will utilize our E360 tech platform and will receive support from our globally distributed expert resources.
On the Tech side, our SaaS application suite continues to gain traction. During the quarter, for example, we had 22 Mobile Intelligence CRM wins, of which 16 were competitive wins.
With that, let me turn it over to Ron Bruehlman, Senior VP and CFO to take you through the financials in more detail.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. Let me walk you through the detail. Revenue grew to $774 million in the first quarter, an increase of 25.2% on a constant currency basis, with tech services offerings growing 45.8% and information offerings increasing 9%.
Reported revenue growth was lower than constant currency growth as FX continued to be a headwind, but less so than in prior quarters. Total reported revenue growth was 22.5% during the quarter, with tech services revenue growing 43.6% and information revenue up 6%. Excluding the impact of the final quarter of the Cegedim roll-in and the AlphaImpactRx acquisition which we made in Q1, our overall constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, with tech services offerings growing 15.8%, which again reflected solid double-digit growth across our tech services offering portfolio. Once again, growth in our Real-World Evidence offerings was particularly strong.
On the same basis, information's offering revenue grew 0.4% at constant currency, and this was against a tough prior year compare. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, we had strong information revenue growth due to the timing of ad-hoc sales.
Let's look briefly at revenue by geography. During the quarter, developed markets revenue grew 24.7% at constant currency, and emerging markets 28.1%. At actual FX, developed markets grew 23.3%, and emerging markets 18.3%.
The FX impact on the year-over-year growth rate was greatest in emerging markets as currency such as the Brazilian real, the Turkish lira, and Argentinean peso have weakened versus the dollar during the past year. Now, excluding the Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx acquisitions, emerging markets grew 10.6% and developed markets 6.5% at constant currency.
Now, as you know, April 1 marked the anniversary of the Cegedim acquisition. So this is the last quarter we will highlight Cegedim's contributions to our revenue growth.
Moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $236 million for the quarter; that's up 9.4% at constant currency and 9.3% on a reported basis. FX had a smaller impact in the quarter on adjusted EBITDA than on revenue because of differences in the margins of our various geographies.
As a reminder, the margin compression we experienced during the quarter was expected and with the result of absorbing the unfavorable impact of much lower margins from acquired businesses, and this was partially offset by continued cost reduction and restructuring activity in the core business.
GAAP net income was $43 million during the quarter compared with $298 million last year and the year-over-year variance was driven entirely by a one-time tax item last year. And you'll recall that during the first quarter of 2015, we began asserting that our non-U.S. earnings would be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. with a company no longer accruing taxes on those foreign earnings at the higher U.S. rate.
This resulted in a $256 million non-cash income tax benefit in last year's first quarter from a one-time reduction in our deferred tax liability. GAAP diluted earnings per share during the quarter were $0.13 compared with $0.86 in the prior year quarter; and again, the driver of this variance was principally the benefit from the one-time tax item that we had last year. Adjusted net income, which we calculate using cash taxes was $140 million in the quarter, an increase versus prior year, 6.4% at constant currency, and 3.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.42 in the first quarter. That was up 9.5% constant currency and 6.3% reported.
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. At March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $378 million and the principal amount of debt was $4.6 billion resulting in net debt of $4.2 billion. Net cash used in operating activities was $15 million in the first quarter, compared with cash provided of $30 million in the first quarter of 2015.
As you recall, the Q1 cash flow is seasonally weak as we pay our annual bonuses to employees in this quarter; the decline versus prior year was primarily due to several items, one of which was a large upfront investment in specialty data. We also had a higher restructuring-related severance payment and cash payments associated with the loyalty card programs we manage on behalf of our clients.
And regarding those programs, these were â came from businesses that we did not own in the first quarter of last year that we acquired subsequently. And keep in mind, as I mentioned before, inflows and outflows of the loyalty card programs tend to balance out over the course of the year. They just happen to be negative in this quarter. Our capital expenditures in addition to deferred software of $39 million increased by $7 million versus the first quarter of 2015. Unlevered free cash flow for the first quarter was $537 million for the quarter or positive $53 million adjusting for the loyalty card program.
Now let's turn to 2016 guidance and I'll start with the full year. We are reaffirming our full-year constant currency guidance, which is revenue growth of 10% to 12%; adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5% to 9.5%; adjusted net income growth of 6.5% to 8.5%; and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8.5% to 10.5%.
Now, after discussing FX headwinds for the past two plus years, I'm pleased to say that we're raising our full-year reported guidance due to some recent improvement in foreign currency rates. Assuming foreign exchange rates hold at current level through the end of 2016, we expect full year reported revenue growth of 9% to 11%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5% to 9.5%, adjusted net income growth of 2% to 4%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 6%, and all of those metrics are up 1.5 percentage point versus the prior guidance.
Now, you'll note that FX impacts adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS more than it does adjusted EBITDA and let me explain. The principal driver there is that our FX hedges, which are two in nature: one, our substantial euro-denominated interest expenses; secondly, forward contracts we have on our foreign royalty payments, these will turn negative during the balance of the year current FX rates hold, and, of course, these impacts come below the adjusted EBITDA line.
Now, of course, we all know that FX rates can and will change. So we may need to update our reported guidance during the balance of the year. This is our best view based on where rates are today in assuming the whole.
Okay, for Q2 specifically, our constant currency guidance is for revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% to 6%, adjusted net income growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. Again, assuming current foreign exchange rates hold through the end of the second quarter, our Q2 reported or actual currency guidance is for revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, adjusted net income growth of 1% to 2%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 2% to 3%.
Finally, we're reaffirming our 2016 unlevered free cash flow guidance of between 70% and 80% of adjusted EBITDA. So, in summary, this quarter was much like our prior quarters with double-digit growth across the Technology Services portfolio excluding the impact of course of the Cegedim, AlphaImpactRx acquisitions and solid, high-single-digit organic Technology Services growth, continued momentum in Real-World Evidence and tech and apps including a number of important contract wins, a continued solid earnings growth, a reaffirmation of our constant currency guidance, and with a little bit of help from FX increasing our reported guidance.
Of course, we're pleased to be reporting strong numbers on top of the planned merger with Quintiles, which we believe is a transformational deal for both companies.
And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for our Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Thanks. Good morning. Ari or Ron, can you give us anymore granularity on the revenue drivers within tech services, I know you highlighted Real-World Evidence et cetera, but any specifics?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, as always tech and apps and Real-World Evidence were the faster growing pieces of our three main areas, right? We have tech and apps, we have Real-World Evidence, we have then the labor-based services, workflow analytics, and consulting. And it was basically good growth across the different offerings, but particularly strong on Real-World Evidence, and on the tech and apps.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Is it possible to give specific percentages in terms of growth rates in those particular areas?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Go ahead, Ron.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Look, on a core basis, they were all double-digit growth in the quarter. There was some benefit of tuck-in acquisitions in those numbers, and when I say core, I mean excluding Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx. But even excluding those tuck-in acquisitions, overall solid high single-digit organic growth for tech services.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
And, Ron, can you remind me on the organic tech services growth x the tuck-under deals, has high-single-digit been consistent for the last several quarters? I'm recalling, it might have been double-digits in prior quarter.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No, it's pretty consistent high single-digit, actually remarkably consistent high single-digit.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Okay. And then. I missed...
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean just to â I'm sorry, Peter, with respect, we have a lot of questions in the line; you asked three questions, why don't you ask the fourth one on a follow-up with our IR team?
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Sure. Will do. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Let's go to the next question. Thanks, Peter, sorry.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just as a follow-up on the tech services business, can you give us a little more detail on what some of these tuck-in deals are that kind of drove half of the tech services growth during the period?
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Look, there are workflow analytics area, some in services, some of them are tech-related. I don't believe we had any in the management consulting area. And we â I think we had a little bit of contribution in Real-World Evidence. So it's not an any one area; it's really pretty much across the portfolio.
Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great. And then maybe just one question on the merger, if you will. And I apologize if I missed this on the other call, but the $100 million of cost synergies you talk about how those are going to specifically be driven. You guys have done a great job of moving work to some of your global centers of excellence on the IMS side of the business. Is it essentially going to be, to some extent, a repeat of that, incrementally focused on the Quintiles business? Any color on that would be great.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, you're on the mark. I mean, look we're two large companies with big cost structures. And so it is natural that there will be some overlapping SG&A in many parts of the world. They're in many countries, we're in many countries. There is overlapping IT infrastructure and support. You're correct, from a production and operations point of view, we each have global delivery centers that have been set up offshore. We believe that the utilization of those can be increased and generating good efficiencies across the board. And, I mean, that's the usual and traditional sources of synergies. Again, $100 million not â we have very good visibility on this. Again, geographic overlaps, administrative costs, duplicative technology infrastructure, utilization of development and production centers offshore which both of us have done, and doing a better job at accelerating this in for the combined company.
Jamie J. Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Ari. I want to talk to you about the faster growth, the 100 basis points to 200 basis points that should come out of the combined organization by year three. Is that a better deal for Quintiles than IMS? In other words, are we going to see the 100 basis points to 200 basis points on the IMS' business? So if you could speak to your long-term, medium-term growth of mid-single-digit constant currency organic, including 1 point of M&A, is that going to be 100 basis points to 200 basis points better when we get to the end of year three?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Obviously, once we are closed, we are operating as a one company, so there won't be IMS and Quintiles, there would be Quintiles IMS. And when we talk about incremental growth revenue coming from the combination, we mean to say that it is one to â the combined company will be growing at 1 point to 2 points higher rate than â in combination, in that we have simply added the two companies together.
So if you do the math, over and above, our current revenue growth, as you reminded us, of mid-single-digit topline revenue growth and the topline revenue growth of Quintiles over and above that, if you do the math, obviously, there will be ramp, right? It's not going to happen right away, but exiting year three, the â at the mid-point of that range, it represents somewhere in the $400 million to $500 million incremental revenue over and above what we would have arrived at separately, okay?
And you could assume a nice drop-through rate on that, which is in the 30s% and we've modeled that very extensively, and, obviously, you can well imagine that it is our â has been our established practice here to under-promise and over-deliver.
Look, we've â there are examples of companies in the clinical development area where the use of data has been shown to â lead to higher win rate and incremental revenues. And when we compare what these two companies bring to the table to those other examples, it is not on the same planet, okay?
We're bringing five â a record of over 0.5 billion anonymized patient level data assets. This simply is nothing that comes close. It's on a global basis. When you put this to work at the service of clinical development optimization at the design phase, at the execution phase, you are going to see significant gains, I believe, in market share. That's â we feel strongly about this â this is one key lever of the revenue growth.
The second one, and that applies â so that's clearly â to answer your question specifically, is on the Quintiles side of the ledger, but clearly we are enabling it. On the Real-World Evidence side, the second most significant value lever, that's really a combination. Our Real-World Evidence business is slightly larger than theirs, so in combination we are a formidable player in the marketplace when we combine our capabilities and our customer reach. And we believe that the combined capabilities accelerate the momentum of each of our businesses. And so that, if you will, the benefit of the incremental growth accrues to both sides to the degree that there were both sides.
And finally, on the commercial side, we think that the opportunities for outsourcing, which we have been essentially riding on the trend of pharma companies, increasingly looking to partner with providers that can provide the analytic support and technology support for their go-to-market activities. Now, Quintiles brings to the table an actual field force and it brings to the table additional advisory capabilities which we are going to look to productionize, field to what we have done with our old consulting business. We've focused on standardized processes. And with repeatable higher margin, lower-cost, offshore delivery, standardized processes we're going to replicate that across the Quintiles portfolio. So in a way, it's simply leveraging what we've done, what we're in the process of continuing to benefit from across a broader base of business.
So it's not either one side or the other, it's really on both sides of the ledger. And we again are very excited. It is not â Andrew, you know us a little bit and it is not our practice to rely on revenue synergies when we do a deal, we look at cost. Interestingly, this is one of those quite unique moment where I think you can â you're putting together two extraordinary companies and creating a game-changing one. And because it is unique, we're going to spend the time with you and colleagues and investors and explain why we believe this is really transformative, it's innovative, and it's going to lead to superior growth profile and great returns for our shareholders.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Perfect. Thanks for taking the time.

Our next question comes from Steven Wardell with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Wardell - Leerink Partners LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering are there any regulatory approvals that you foresee that you will need in the U.S. or internationally?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, we â these customary approvals including antitrust and so on, we do not foresee any issues here. Again, this is the joining of highly complementary businesses. Quintiles serves primarily, not exclusively, but primarily the clinical development side, the product development side of the house. We service primarily the commercial side. It does create a unique combination. We will be â as soon as we end the call here, our lawyers are going to continue to work on the regulatory filings. We don't expect any issues. We operate in many, many, jurisdictions. So it's just a â procedurally going to be a process and it will take some time. And that's why we said we anticipate a close some time in the second half of 2016, most likely in the fall. And that's what we are aiming for. So again, we don't anticipate any issues, just traditional customary regulatory approvals.
Steven Wardell - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks. And then you discussed how IMS has a retrospective analysis capability with Real-World Evidence and Quintiles has a prospective primary data collection capability and that creates a distinct capability. Could you just give an example of how this would make a more attractive product for a customer, just to help us understand this better?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, look, the best way I can say it is we are providing something, but it has holes. And Quintiles is providing something else and it also has holes and it happens to be that their holes are where we are covered and our holes are where they're covered. So traditionally, if we are the only provider of that particular study, we're going to provide something and the client is going to have to go out or request that we go and do some custom work. Because Quintiles has done these studies, empirical studies extensively, we have that at our fingertip. Conversely, when Quintiles does studies, they are missing data and they have to go out and either buy data or work with third parties to try to bring it in.
Our goal is â again, it's very consistent with what we've done in the IMS. Bear in mind, IMS has a data business and what was called a consulting and services business, which was again a series of discrete transactional studies. We moved our business model to a data business that enables and powers up productionized solutions. That's what's scalable; that's what creates revenue growth and market share gains; and that's what creating strong profit drop-through. And we would like to do the same on the product development side and on the Real-World Evidence side. And we believe there is great opportunity to do that. When you bring together on a Real-World Evidence, the breadth and efficiency of retrospective data, and the depth of prospective data, you got the full â you got the magic sauce, right? We bring breadth and Quintiles bring depth to the issue. And we think that, that's just unparalleled, unmatched set of capabilities when put together.
Steven Wardell - Leerink Partners LLC
Great. Thank you.
Thomas Kinsley - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Planning
Maybe one more question, Andrew.
Operator
Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. So, I guess, we don't have in-depth, I guess, pharma background here. But, I mean, when I understood your strategy, I guess especially with the CROs, I always thought it was more a alliance strategy. And I can somewhat understand Quintiles benefiting from having all the data in their hands exclusively and maybe benefiting that. But from â I'm just trying to understand from IMS' strategy, right, I mean, why doesn't it make more sense to license your data to all the CROs, price it higher if it's that valuable and make it accretive that way as opposed to sort of owning the CRO asset itself?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, you can imagine, we asked ourselves that question many times. Look, the data is valuable not because it's a data, right? It's not the data, it's what you do with it. And our modeling has concluded that it is best to participate in the economic upside of selling the solution powered and differentiated by the data.
Look, we had the same dilemma on the commercial side, right? We used to transactionally on a discrete basis sell the data to solution providers that essentially capture it; sometimes with very limited value-add, a big portion of the total economic value delivered to the client by leveraging the data. When you just sell the data, it's hard to price into the transaction, the value that's captured by the solution provider.
And secondly, the solutions market, we used to call it broadly, is a much larger market, much larger market than the data market itself. The reason is, the same data enables a wide spectrum of applications. So in the same way that we've moved into the commercial space and the analytics space and the technology space on the commercial side, we would like to similarly create that differentiation on the product development side. It happens to be that jointly, Quintiles and ourselves, believe that the industry, their side of the industry is very ripe for efficiency improvements and transformation. As we said on the merger call, it's an industry that has been relatively static and for good reason it's more regulated, it's high process intensive, but a lot of these processes were largely manual and idiosyncratic to the studies. It has great potential for technology enablement, automation, and certainly a great opportunity for differentiation through data. If we sold the data, as sometimes we do today, it would be â every single time, will be sort of a custom type of development. By being together, we can productionize that. We're going to work on building the data mining algorithms that are necessary through push of a button generate the targeting of sites and optimize the clinical trial design and execution. That's the difference. And we â in our modeling, in our scenarios, has concluded that the value, the strategic and economic value to be derived of putting the two companies together is dramatically greater by merging with Quintiles.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask Ron just to follow-up, just to make sure we are all on the same page; in terms of the organic growth this quarter excluding all deals, can you tell us what that was exactly total and then tech services.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think I said it on the remarks...
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. We didn't give you the exact number, but we gave you enough to get close. 7.2% is the core growth, we said a little bit more than half of that was due to the tuck-in acquisitions.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Just over half.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Just over half and almost all those acquisitions were in the tech services space. So from that you can â and we said high-single-digit for the tech services. So I think you have all â everything you need there.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
All right, fine. Thanks a lot guys.
Thomas Kinsley - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Planning
Okay. I think we've got time for one more.

And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks very much. Two quick questions, both deal related. I think you guys have talked about an opportunity for a tax savings of about $35 million from the combination, just wanted to clarify that that is an annual number, and will there be a sales and FX effect of that? And then also, Ari, the patient asset coming from EMR and so forth, I think the number was about $530 million. How broadly is that â can you say where those are geographically? I assume a lot of them are not in the U.S.? Thank you.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
John, I'll do the tax one first and I'll turn it over to Ari. The tax number is an annual number. We have about at IMS a total of over $350 million of deferred U.S. tax assets, these are net operating loss carry forward and foreign tax credits that are unutilized. And we can use those to offset Quintiles tax bill by $35 million each year into 2020. So it's an accelerated tax benefit. Obviously, we're going to use those tax benefits over time anyway, but we will use them more quickly. So there will be an acceleration benefit. Ari?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. But the patient wise, I don't know what's patient wise. I believe, and I want you to check in the number here; of the $530 million, I think my recollection is that $240 million of those are in the U.S. and the rest are overseas in the key â in the major markets. So again, it's a very, very significant data asset and there's nothing that comes close, nothing.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Thomas Kinsley - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Planning
