Max Webb
Thank you John. Good morning everybody. Our results of 2017 fully reflect the execution of stated business plan. We monetized several assets during 2017, the most significant of which the sale of our 57% owned homebuilding subsidiary, UCP, Inc. We ultimately received proceeds of $114.5 million for our stake in UCP. In addition, in 2017, our water resource development, Vidler Water Company, sold 102,500 long term storage credits in Arizona for total proceeds of $25.9 million.
As a result of these monetizations, we were very pleased to be able to pay a special dividend of $5 per share to our shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2017. We also reduced our costs significantly in 2017 from prior years and John will address this in more detail in his remarks. As a result of these efforts in 2017, we are now, for all intents and purposes, a water resource development company with these operations conducted through Vidler Water Company and its subsidiaries. We believe Vidler's portfolio of water resource assets and projects in the Southwest are unique and highly strategic that should ultimately provide value to our shareholders as those assets are monetized.
Our most significant water assets are located in Northern Nevada, in and around the Greater Reno/Sparks area. We are pleased to note the continued robust job and population growth in that area during 2017 and that strong job and population growth are projected to continue over the course of the next several years. We believe this growth should lead to new residential and commercial development and we believe any such new development in the areas where our water assets are located should then lead monetization of our water resources in those areas as these developers secure their future sustainable water supplies.
However, the pace of such residential and commercial development and thus the timing of monetization of our assets is largely out of our control and highly dependent on the continued growth in the region. We believe we are a responsible corporate citizen and we only develop long-term sustainable water solutions to the users of our water assets. We are also strong proponents of responsible and managed growth. This leads to a better quality of life for all citizens.
But we are concerned with the pace of residential permit approvals in the Greater Reno/Sparks area. Any delays in bringing new supplies of homes into the market means that housing becomes even less affordable and potentially threatens to undermine the economic benefits accruing to the region from the job growth that has occurred. That said, we believe that the business and political leaders in the region recognize this issue and appear to be working to ensure the right conditions exist to provide much needed new supplies of housing in the Greater Reno/Sparks region.
Finally, on October 2 we announced we had engaged JMP Securities as PICO's exclusive financial adviser and Cooley LLP as PICO's legal counsel to explore strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value. The engagements are intended to evaluate potential strategic alternatives such as business combinations, the sale of the company or a merger or a sale, license or disposition of assets of the company. I will note that this process is ongoing, but neither John nor I will comment further at this time on the status or progress of this engagement.
With that, I will hand the call over to John.
John Perri
Thank you Max. At December 31, 2017, we reported shareholders' equity of $207.2 million comprised primarily of $37.1 million of cash, which we believe is more than adequate to cover our estimated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future and approximately $170 million in our water assets. During 2017, our overhead expenses declined due to reductions in employee headcount, executive compensation, stock-based compensation and directors and other professional fees.
Such reductions resulted in a decrease in overhead expenses of $4.3 million quarter-over-quarter and $10.8 million year-over-year. We believe our cash burn rate for 2018 will be approximately $6.2 million. We estimated that our net operating losses at December 31, 2017 were approximately $185 million and we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets.
With that, we will open the call up to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Shapiro of Lawndale Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shapiro
Hi. Thank you. From the limited summary income statement in the press release, we can discern there was $3.3 million of expense between the revenues and the pretax loss from continuing ops and you provided a little bit of insight, if I am correct, that you expect about a $6.2 million cash burn for the full year of 2018 in terms of your burn rate. So I would think we are going to see a lower quarterly rate here in Q1, from what we can impute from Q4. By the end of Q1, which is only a month away, is our burn rate expected to be down at that $6.2 million annual rate? Or do you have other costs, leases, whatever it may be, coming offline progressively throughout the year?
John Perri
Well, thanks, Andrew, for the question. I think we expect that fairly evenly spread throughout the year. So I would think one quarter of that $6.2 million will be incurred each quarter throughout the year. Of course, there are one-time expenses that we haven't anticipated that could throw that off.
Andrew Shapiro
Sure.
John Perri
But as it stands, we expect that to be fairly even.
Andrew Shapiro
So you think we are down there already for Q1?
John Perri
Yes. For all practical purposes, what I have seen so far is we are down there.
Andrew Shapiro
Awesome. Okay. Now you called out, in prior quarters, the Arizona assets as likely being the closest to monetization, which obviously turned out to be correct. Are there more assets in Arizona you feel might be close to monetization? Or is that likely it for now? And is there now a new area or set of assets you are focused on that might be closest to monetization?
Max Webb
Good morning Andy. It's Max. I think our Arizona long-term storage credits make a very good solution to some of the issues facing Arizona because of the shortages on Colorado River. It's likely that from forecast to date that it's going to be another dry year in the Southwest and that may put more pressure on the Colorado River. So I think our estimate, if you will, we thought that long-term storage credits get monetized before other assets is still likely. But they could well be simultaneous. They are in different markets with different dynamics and so any monetizations of those assets are independent of each other.
Andrew Shapiro
Right. So in some ways, companies have receivables, inventory, et cetera and some of those assets are kind of more current or more liquid than others. Do you view the company's storage credits in Arizona to be pretty liquid, if you had to or wanted to move them out?
Max Webb
Yes.
Andrew Shapiro
I mean, pardon the pun, of course.
Max Webb
We have gotten used to it over the years.
Andrew Shapiro
Yes. Okay. And then in your release you referred to the tax NOLs and you referred us to a 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. As of 15 minutes ago, at least I couldn't find that 10-K on EDGAR where your past filings were. Did I miss it or it just hasn't been filed, even though the press release referred to it in the past tense?
John Perri
Yes. It has not been filed yet. We hope to file that very soon.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. Just a few more specific questions on the water rights, if you won't mind. We saw that StoneGate in Reno's North Valley passed a major developmental hurdle. What are the next steps for it before their need and interest in acquiring some of our Fish Springs water ripens?
Max Webb
Well, they will have to go to the regional planning commission, I believe and then go back to the second reading at the Reno City Council to get their tentative map. It varies from developer to developer, but they are likely to, it depends on how much infrastructure they want to put in place before going to final map and at final map is when they would have to demonstrate that they have sustainable water supplies for the project.
Andrew Shapiro
Right. Okay. And there are other developments in the area that have the similar hurdles and similar things and we have talked at the Annual Meeting and maybe on the conference calls about there's a lot of people sitting around on the edge here all looking and the issue is to get the first one to jump, it establishes a price level and others may likely want to get into the pool before the cost materially rises. What are the other developments that may become earlier customers for water from Fish Springs? And what are the next steps for them to take in the most likely of those developments that have to overcome first here?
Max Webb
Well, there are some smaller developments that have infill for a small amount of units and therefore a small amount of water supplies needed. I don't like to comment on individual developers because, again, it's completely out with our control. They have their own dynamics and how quickly or slow they may move forward a particular project. I will comment that as a group of developers that do have either zoning approval already or some that are going through the same process that StoneGate is going through, that clearly they are looking at the supply-demand dynamics of housing in that area and moving accordingly.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. What are the status updates on development and value enhancement of your other Northern Nevada water rights as well as your Las Vegas area water rights?
Max Webb
Well, with the other Northern Nevada rights, you are referring to our water rights in -- ?
Andrew Shapiro
Carson City.
Max Webb
Yes, right, in Lyon County. That's driven very largely as a result of the growth in that area. USA Parkway, completion of that extension, which allows residents from Lyon County to commute to Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center much more easily now is a big driver and there's a lot of developer interest in the Lyon County-Dayton corridor area, which obviously, for the same reason as we talked about in Reno, as and when developers move from tentative to final map, they will need to secure up sustainable water supplies, which should lead to monetization of our water assets in that area.
The Southern Nevada assets are much less material. They are very long-term in the sense that we appropriated new water supply that comes with a lot of challenges, but ultimately can create a lot of value. As and when development in the Lincoln County Land Management Act or potential power projects come to fruition which again timing is always very uncertain, those assets, those water rights would be required to be part of the sustainable water supply.
Andrew Shapiro
And with respect to the other water rights, which may be in our bucket, but for now that I do see items in the legal databases in particular for New Mexico, has there been any status changes to discuss here on the development and value enhancement of your water rights and credits in New Mexico, Colorado or any other state?
Max Webb
No. The only other assets we have are in New Mexico and Colorado, as you mentioned. Colorado, where we lease or sell those, they are very small sales and very small value in terms of the overall assets that Vidler has. New Mexico, our biggest asset that we are in the process of developing is the water rights that we are going through the process of appropriating just north of Albuquerque for a particular project. That status hasn't changed. We are still in the process of going through the state engineer to get those water rights appropriated.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And last questions are related to, I guess, they call it the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Proposals and what it's status is and what the latest Lake Mead surface elevation levels are, which I am sure you guys monitor regularly? And remind us what the key elevation threshold is, so we get a feel for how close the Lake's at?
Max Webb
I don't have that at my fingertips. I think it's about 1,075 feet, if I recollect off the top of my head. I think what we monitor is the snowpack that leads to run off in the Colorado River. The forecasts in mid-February were calling for continued dry weather that obviously then the runoff goes into Lake Powell and Lake Mead. We understand, based on current measurements in the upper basin of the Colorado River where most of the water is generated, there's a distinct possibility that the snow water equivalent is tracking lower than even 2002, which was the lowest year in recorded history. So there appears to be pressure on runoff into those reservoirs.
Operator
Our next question comes from [indiscernible], a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning gentlemen.
Max Webb
Good morning.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you very much. 2017 was an excellent year. Thank you.
Max Webb
You are welcome.
Unidentified Analyst
A couple of questions. So you mentioned that there's a cash balance of $37.1 million and that the burn rate going forward will be $6.2 million. So roughly, that's six years' worth. Can you talk about your plans for the cash balance going forward, please?
Max Webb
Well, I think that's largely dependent on the results of the strategic alternatives process. If we are continuing as a standalone company moving forward, I would think that that would allow us for, again, opportunistic repurchases of our stock or other method of returning capital to shareholders.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So is it fair to say you don't plan on continuing to hold six years' worth of administrative expenses?
Max Webb
That's correct. No, we would not.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then with the decreases in audit fees and things that, do you expect the administrative burn rate to come down even further? Or do you think $6.2 million is the rate going forward, assuming no changes to the portfolio?
Max Webb
Well, I don't know if you have spoken to our auditors. I don't know if they have got a feeling on the fee. I know John works very hard to get that to as manageable level as possible. We are always on the lookout for responsible cost cuts to ensure we take the responsibility of maintaining a public company very seriously. And as you probably know that there is a fixed cost that goes with that, whether it's audit fees, maintaining internal controls, having the right staff to be able to report timely, accurately, et cetera, especially on complex assets like our water assets that are, frankly, very unusually unique for public companies. But yes, we are always looking for areas that we can cut costs further.
John Perri
I would just add to that, to Max's point, we are always looking to cut costs, but I think that number, the $6.2 million, is a good estimate of the burn rate. And I don't expect any major changes, positive or negative, again, caveat that with unexpected costs do occur and could drive that number up. But in absence of those kind of things, I think the $6.2 million is a good number for the year and then we will see what happens thereafter.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then what do you, gentlemen, estimate your CapEx requirements are going forward, maintenance of any assets in the water portfolio or any enhancements that need to be made?
Max Webb
Well, we don't have any CapEx requirements outside a fraction for computer server or whatever, maintenance, which is $10,000, $20,000. In terms of the water assets, they are, for the most part, fully developed, especially our Arizona and Northern Nevada assets. They do require ongoing maintenance that get expensed. That $6.2 million number that John refers to includes all those costs. That's all the project costs that we expect to incur.
I would add that of that $6.2 million, there are costs for appropriation of New Mexico water rights. So I would view those as being one-off. Hopefully though, we get those water rights appropriated, then we don't have to incur those costs anymore. So there's always room to reduce those.
We sold our Arizona credits, for instance. We would have less property taxes to pay from the real estate that we own as part of those storage credits in Arizona. So costs would come down. So again, just want to emphasize, the ongoing maintenance costs required to maintain those assets in good stead and ensure that they are available-for-sale are included in that $6.2 million number.
John Perri
I would just add to that, to Max's point, the $6.2 million not only includes those type of project costs, but just so everyone's aware, it also includes what we think is going to be revenue for the year generated by the various leases and small sales of water rights in Colorado, et cetera, that Max talked about. That's about $900,000. So when you are looking at the gross pieces, about $7.1 million of total overhead plus project costs, offset by about $900,000 in revenue for the year and that's how we get to the $6.2 million. Those details will be in the 10-K when we file.
Unidentified Analyst
So $6.2 million is almost like an operating loss number then?
John Perri
In the absence of any other revenue? Yes.
Max Webb
That doesn't include asset sales.
John Perri
That doesn't include asset sales. It's more a predicable revenue that we believe is either contracted or sales are already in the pipeline.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Gentlemen, is there any value left in oil and gas portfolio?
Max Webb
No. We have wound those down.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. I am wondering, this might be more for JP. I am wondering if we could talk a little bit about the Tax Cuts and Job, there is the obligatory question on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and how that will affect PICO. And then after that, I have a question about the deferred tax assets. So does the recent tax legislation have any effect on PICO going forward?
John Perri
Well, I certainly think the lower tax rate is going to be beneficial for us going forward. We measure fair value of our assets. We tax effect those. And reducing that rate certainly helps in looking at any excess fair value over the carrying value. But more importantly, our NOLs, the ones we have at 12/31/17 will not be limited in their use. Any NOLs going forward could be and will be most likely. But what we have on the books would be fully usable in any year that we have the taxable income. So with that, I don't think there's tremendous impacts to our business because of the tax reform act other than, obviously, lower taxes, if we end up paying any taxes.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. But so the lack of a charge on the P&L for the fourth quarter, I assume that the deferred tax assets were reduced due to the 35% to 21% corporate tax rate changes, just that it was covered up by the valuation allowance was adjusted pro rata?
John Perri
That's exactly right, yes. There's about $35 million haircut to the net DTA, which was completely offset by the reduction in the valuation allowance.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So absent a valuation allowance, then we would have seen a charge of $35 million. But because of the valuation allowance, it doesn't show up in the P&L, it will show up in the footnotes?
John Perri
That's correct.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Understood. And then in the footnotes, there are so many different classes of deferred tax assets. I am wondering exactly what the quantity is that is utilizable in the event of asset sales? So I mean, obviously, not all of them would be utilizable in the event of an asset sale. Can you elaborate on that?
John Perri
Yes. So to your point, there are quite a few classifications, but there are two or three that stick out on my mind. Clearly, the NOLs would come down, if there's an asset sale that generates taxable income. There are also some DTAs up there for impairment losses that we have taken on these assets in the past. And as those are sold, those DTAs will come down and change the taxable income calculations. Those are two of the biggest deferred tax assets we have on the books at the year-end.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. And so do you have kind of a gross number then, that you can give that would say, okay, X amount of dollars over historical costs will be tax-free. Is that calculable?
John Perri
I can calculate it. I don't have that at my fingertips. Are you trying to get to a number where it's a fair value less all the NOLs? Or excuse me, taxable income less all the NOLs equals --?
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. I am wondering --
John Perri
[indiscernible] so to speak?
Unidentified Analyst
Well, I am wondering exactly as we get to a premium over historical costs about how much of that is going to be tax free and then how much we are going to see an outflow to the taxing authority. That's what I am getting at.
Max Webb
I mean, that ultimately depends on what those assets are monetized for. I think that a quick and dirty way of looking at it is that there's $185 million of taxable income that can be sheltered and that is at --
John Perri
At the federal level, anyway.
Max Webb
At the federal level. And most of our Nevada assets should not suffer any state income taxes. And I can't speak to Arizona. That's John's baby. But I think that's the easy way to look at it.
Unidentified Analyst
So simplifying that, I mean, this is a gross simplification, so if the assets were sold for $185 million above tax basis, we could assume that the transaction would be roughly tax free to shareholders. Is that fair to say?
John Perri
I hate to project that. I think, in a vacuum, as we are talking about it, I think we could say it's probably going to be federal tax free. We would need to look at where those assets were held and to Max's point, Nevada doesn't have state income tax, but Arizona does, California does, obviously. But I think you are thinking along the right lines.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then my last question relates to the compensation disclosure going forward. So the SEC filings that outline the bonus calculation, some of the stuff is kind of complicated. Some of it is open to interpretation. So I am wondering what PICO plans to disclose as far as those calculation is going forward? I mean, obviously, it's not a huge number for 2017, but we may get into much larger numbers going forward. So is it just a proxy? Does PICO plan on laying out in the proxy statement step-by-step calculations as to how bonuses were calculated? Or is it going to be more vague? Or what is it going to look like going forward, please?
Max Webb
Those are good questions. I think, as you said, it's relatively small and not significant for 2017. And I think we will give great thought as to how we would disclose that in future periods.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Anderson of Anbec Partners. Please go ahead.
David Anderson
Hi. Good morning guys. I wondered if I could circle back to the StoneGate. And I am curious, they have certainly represented in their public hearings that they have water coming from Fish Springs Ranch and I wondered if either specifically or generically if that's more appropriate, you could comment on the nature of any arrangement that they have, that the StoneGate has with Vidler at this point? And how does StoneGate looking at a 20-year development project, if you could just give me some help understanding kind of how they go about securing water over the long-haul?
Max Webb
Well, to answer your first part of the question, there is no arrangement in place with StoneGate. I think both StoneGate and TMWA, Truckee Meadows Water Authority, who are the utility for that area, would know that the Fish Springs water is available to serve developments in the North Valleys. Currently, there is water available and that water could be used to provide the sustainable water supply for the StoneGate development.
And to answer the second part of your question, really, that's a contract that would be entered into by the developer and ourselves. Our arm's length negotiations to what pricing would be and take down. And then as a result of securing those water supplies, what StoneGate would do is go to TMWA and say we have secured up a sustainable water supply. We can get the final map and then TMWA would provide the will-serve. So we are not the utility. Ultimately, TMWA is. But by selling the sustainable water supply to the developer, that's how they are able to obtain their will-serve.
David Anderson
I understand. Okay. That's interesting. So notwithstanding the fact that they have said there is, I guess, you are right, they said there's water available at Fish Springs and that their intent would be to secure it. They have not done so yet. There's no price established. There's no contract. It's something that will be taken care of. Let me ask a more generic question. Looking at a 20-year horizon, is it reasonable to think that the Phase 1 is water needs get contracted and then future phases are under option? Or more generically, you don't have to speak to how this works, but I am just curious when you are looking at Phase 5 today, just assume they are going to deal with it at the end of this, is there an effort to try to negotiate water prices for 15 years down the road?
Max Webb
Yes. I think it remains to be determined. I think it depends on what other water sales are also occurring at the same time, whether the developer wants to secure up more to ensure that they do have those water supplies or not. That's really up to the developer. We can't force them to do anything. That's really their decision. As I said, that's why, with our control, all we can do is provide the water that we have available to those developments.
David Anderson
Great. Thanks very much. That's very helpful.
Max Webb
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Greg Venit of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
GregVenit
Good morning Max.
Max Webb
Good morning Greg. How are you?
Greg Venit
Great. Thank you. The NOL question. So am I correct, isn't it more efficient for you all instead of, you talked about strategic alternatives as far as selling the whole company, but it sounds to me like isn't it more effective to utilize the NOL and then have the proceeds be a return of capital to shareholders? Or doesn't that make more sense?
Max Webb
Well, again, it depends on the view of the buyer and potential purchase price. Obviously, that would be factored into. It's an element that we, as a Board, would factor into analyzing any potential offer.
Greg Venit
For a buyer, what difference would it make, whether they buy the asset or they buy the company? The NOL doesn't transfer over to the new buyer, I don't believe. And if they are only interested really in the assets, at least that's the way I understand it.
Max Webb
I believe you are correct. And it's one of the reasons we are asking shareholders to ratify our tax preservation plan is that on a change of control, those NOLs would be limited. They don't disappear, but they get limited. Again, so that's really, if any potential purchaser would view that and assess that in the valuation and we would assess whether that is reflecting the value that we might otherwise get. Again, it would be a very holistic analysis. It's not just for the NOL, but with any potential offer.
Greg Venit
Is it the intention of the Board, let's say you were to dispose of the water assets and you were to sell them and so the company has cash but still may have NOLs going forward or just be it on cash. Is it the intention of the Board to distribute or essentially distribute that cash to shareholders or essentially liquidate or close down the company? Or would the Board do something else with that cash?
Max Webb
Well, I think, Greg, you are asking questions that are way out in the future. The Board hasn't viewed those. I want to be very clear. We are not in liquidation. Our business plan is to monetize assets at this point. We are in a strategic review process. That may be a one-off transaction if there's a purchaser or it may take several years as we sell those assets. And we would adapt to the facts and circumstances at the time. I think as we demonstrated in 2017, at this point, we are very committed to monetizing the assets at the best possible value that we can do for our shareholders and then returning the proceeds to shareholders.
Greg Venit
Based on your recent sales, let's just take Arizona and the amount of water rights, based on your recent sales, if you were to release or if you were to sell all the water rights, what would that number be based on your last transaction?
Max Webb
Yes. I would not like to comment on that, Greg. I think we have an option agreement with a small farming community, a water conservation district in Arizona that we believe reflects the fair value of the long-term storage credits in the Phoenix Active Management Area where we work with various potential purchasers in Arizona that need to shore up their water supplies. We look to try to, again, maximize the value of those and that's just something I am not going to comment on publicly.
Greg Venit
Is there a way for us to figure it out, the amount of water?
Max Webb
Well, I think we disclosed the amount of inventory that we have. We have approximately 300,000 acre-feet of long-term storage credits, some of which are in the Phoenix Active Management Area. I think that's a good marker where the pricing would be there. There's 250,000 acre-feet in our storage site in Arizona. It's about 70 miles west of Phoenix. Depending on who the purchaser is and whether those water credits are used in-basin or not, would impact pricing. And it depends again on who the buyer is and what the value is.
Obviously, the value wouldn't be higher than the Phoenix Active Management Area amounts. If the buyer was to be in the Phoenix Active Management Area, there would probably be some deduction of wheeling costs to get those credits into the Active Management Area. Again, I don't want to quote a number. We are in the midst of constant negotiations on that and I prefer to be able to be free to be able to do that.
Greg Venit
Okay. Very good. Thanks for the good work.
Max Webb
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Melby of Gate City Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Michael Melby
Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the question. I am just curious, did you sell any water rights or credits in Q4? And could you elaborate on that if you did? Thank you.
Max Webb
Sure. Good morning Mike. Yes, we sold 2,500 long-term storage credits in the Phoenix Active Management Area under the option agreement we had with the water conservation district. So that would have been a $350 per long-term storage credit. You may recollect that after December 31, that pricing goes up by 5% every six months. And I believe we sold a small amount of water rights in Colorado as well in fourth quarter.
Michael Melby
Got it. Thank you.
Max Webb
Thank you.
Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Max Webb for any closing remarks.
