John Levy
Thanks Alvin. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
As we review what has been a record setting start to our new fiscal year. I'm pleased to report that theScore has turned in its best ever quarter in terms of gaming handle and media revenue. These record results demonstrate how fans are increasingly engaging with our mobile sports media and betting platforms. We were primed and ready as sports resumed this quarter.
As evidenced by the numbers, we're starting to unlock the potential of theScore and theScore Bet, showcasing the value of a fully integrated media and gaming business. As our gaming operations in the U.S. expand, we are simultaneously preparing for what is an enormous opportunity on the horizon in Canada, with the anticipated creation of a fully legalized and regulated sports betting and iGaming market.
theScoreâs popularity in Canada is unmatched in the mobile sports space, and we are eager to deliver theScore Bet to our fans in our home territory. The momentum in Canada, coupled with these outstanding results underscores our strong market position in mobile sports media and sports betting and the exciting opportunities ahead in these high growth industries.
We also further strengthened our balance sheet via the bought deal offering we closed in December, raising more than $46 million for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The proceeds support the multi-jurisdiction deployment and operation of theScore Bet and user acquisition and retention in jurisdictions where we are or will be operating.
Also, today in our earnings release, we announced that we are considering an additional public listing on a U.S. stock exchange. This strategy is one our management team has been studying and we believe access to the U.S. capital markets would provide compelling benefits to theScore and our investor base. Weâll further cover that news in today's call.
First though, I'd like to recap an impressive quarter for our gaming operations. When we launched our sports book, we applied our expertise in technology and mobile sports to create a completely differentiated betting experience, one that harnesses the power of media and gaming. It's an approach that is working. Gaming handle was up 535% year-over-year in Q1, reaching $55.8 million for the period as fans continue to gravitate to our unique combination of media and betting.
This ongoing growth has been achieved as we deepen our market leading media and gaming integration, including the launch of Bet section on theScore app, which Benjie will share more on shortly. We are highly encouraged by the early foothold that we have established in this fast growing industry. And we are well equipped to continue our expansion across North America. We believe the quarter with successful launches of theScore Bet in Colorado, I'm sorry, we began the quarter with the successful launches of theScore Bet in Colorado and Indiana.
And we're preparing to debut in Iowa in the coming weeks subject of course to regulatory approval. Now, with marquee sporting events coming up, including the Super Bowl and our first NCAA tournament as an operator, we're extremely well positioned to continue on this growth trajectory. Of course, one of the markets we hope to be operating in soon is on our home turf in Canada.
We estimate a market potential for online gaming here at between 3.8 U.S. - between $3.8 billion and $5.4 billion in annual gross gaming revenue based on historical data, extrapolated from the legal online gaming markets in the U.S. and globally. Ontario alone is a huge market with population larger than all before U.S. states. It is now clear that there is cross party support and strong momentum to amend Canada's outdated federal laws and enable legal sports betting market to flourish.
And we have been actively participating in those conversations with both the federal and provincial levels. theScore is Canada's leading mobile sports brand, with millions of loyal app users across this country. And we're in a great position to capitalize on the expansion of online gaming. We're hard at work preparing for this sizeable opportunity and look forward to seeing legislation progress in 2021.
As the only truly integrated mobile media and gaming company in North America, we are uniquely positioned for the tremendous opportunity ahead in gaming. Our industry, sports betting, mobile sports media and esports are high growth and continue to rapidly develop. As previously mentioned, we are considering a listing on a U.S. stock exchange as the next step to achieve our business.
In our view, it is timely for this consideration. And we believe the potential benefits for theScore, and our investor base may include significantly larger pool of capital, greater average daily trading volume, exposure to a - larger number of U.S. retail and institutional investors and a potential increase in market valuation. In today's earnings release, we also announced that we'll be holding a virtual annual and special meeting of shareholdersâ on February 10.
At that meeting, and in conjunction with the potential listing, we'll be asking shareholders to approve a special resolution to authorize theScoreâs Board of Directors to elect a share consolidation. We've included details of the proposed share consolidation in our management information circular, which is being sent to shareholders in advance of the meeting, and will be publicly available on our Investor Relations site.
I'll now turn things over to Benjie, who will provide a summary of results in our media operations as well as a closer look at some other product and content initiatives this quarter. Benjie?
Benjie Levy
Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone.
In Q1, we achieved a new all time record for media revenue, generating $10.6 million. Following the sports hiatus, brand partners have been eager to connect with our large and engaged mobile app audience. In the quarter, we ran campaigns for notable brands, including the NBA, Fox Sports and Trojan in the U.S. and Audi, Volkswagen and Tiguan in Canada.
Further, our app continues to be relied upon source of sports news and content. We recorded an impressive $3.9 million monthly active users this quarter, each opening theScore an average of 116 times a month. These results were achieved in the absence of the traditional sports calendar, with no regular season NBA or NHL action, and are strong indication of our brand loyalty with sports fans across North America.
Onto social media, with the power of our channels continues to attract both huge audiences as well as brand partners. We reached an audience of approximately 105 million users in Q1 across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok with head and shoulders and subway activating on our platform. Much like the user behavior we're seeing on our media app, fans are increasingly engaging with our social content, which serves not just as an opportunity to amplify theScore brand, but to drive advertising dollars as well.
As John noted earlier in Q1, we released that section on our media app, our most integrated and personalized suite of betting features ever. This new dedicated home for betting on our media app provides greater visibility for our gaming related content and integrations with our sports book, including a deeper availability of markets, and the ability to track your bets and receive cash it offers lives all within theScore.
That section is an example of how we're successfully building integrations, enhancing our user ecosystem and driving across platform activity. Throughout this quarter, we've seen steady growth on theScore Bet hitting record highs in new betters and overall betting activity during a given week, and then topping those numbers Christmas week as the NBA season tipped off. In both cases, we successfully execute integrated automatic campaigns by leveraging all of our content channels to onboard new users and drive betting activity.
We'll be continuing this strategy which is perfectly suited for our fully integrated media and betting platforms. On esports Bet product development work has been focused on our upcoming Iowa launch, as well as ongoing enhancements to our user experience, including improving our already exceptional live betting experience. We're also starting to prepare for the anticipated launch of our online casino product in New Jersey later this year.
Now turning to esports, we set a new all time quarterly record for the third successive period totaling 357 million video views across all platforms. Our esports division is thriving, and we remain one of the only traditional sports media playersâ comprehensively covering esports a testament to the model we've built and to the content we produce.
As North America's preeminent esports media destination, we continue to secure brand partnerships with a list endemic and non-endemic companies such as [Dicho], Riot and MasterCard, who are interested in aligning with our award winning programming and global reach. Last month, we also made our first foray into live event broadcasting as the exclusive English language broadcast partner for a marquee League of Legends tournament from China.
Our esports platforms offer huge audience reach and unrivalled brand recognition in the competitive gaming scene. It's no surprise that we were approached as the ideal partner to produce and distribute this event to fans worldwide. As the global esports landscape develops, we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in this space.
I'll now turn things over to Alvin, who will talk in more detail about our financials.
Alvin Lobo
Thanks Benjie.
Before I provide a financial recap, I need to take a moment to highlight a key development subsequent to the quarter. In December, we bolstered our balance sheet by closing our previously announced $40 million bought deal offering with a full overlap in exercise issued in aggregate of 32.9 million Class A shares raising gross proceeds of $46 million.
Now to the financial recap of the quarter. Total revenue for Q1 fiscal 2021 was $8.5 million versus $9.2 million for the same period in the previous year. Media revenue in Q1 fiscal 2021 of $10.6 million was an all time record for us in a single quarter, primarily driven by strong growth interrupted advertising revenue compared to the prior period. Gaming handle was $55.8 million in Q1 fiscal 2021.
Gross gaming revenue was negative $0.3 million in the quarter when taking into account promotional costs and fair value adjustments on unsettled bets. This resulted in negative net gaming revenue of $2 million for the three months ended November 30.
EBITDA loss in the quarter was $9.3 million versus an EBITDA loss of $4.8 million for the same period last year. Increase in EBITDA loss was primarily due to the result of additional expenses incurred in connection with the expansion of our gaming operations compared to the prior year. From a liquidity perspective, our November 30 pro forma cash balance is $62.4 million in both our $5 million revolving credit facility and our $6.25 million B cap revolving credit facility are undrawn.
That concludes the formal part of our presentation. Rob, we will now take questions from the analysts.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from a line of Matthew Lee from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Matthew Lee
Great choice of earning call right on NHL opening night.
John Levy
Thank you.
Matthew Lee
So my first question is regarding to the - obviously very solid handle numbers you guys posted. Can you maybe break that down in terms of the percentage that comes from New Jersey and that that comes from other states?
John Levy
So we don't, we have not broken down the handle numbers on a state-by-state basis, the point that we usually talk to in that context is, and the reason we don't is because of the nature-nature of the business operations in those states. Matt as you know, we just, basically launched in Colorado and Indiana. And we look at basically, the total aggregate of what we're doing in a comparative over all in the year.
What we do see is, in the numbers that we look at, is that we're very encouraged by these early signs is what we're seeing actually in all the states. And we basically look towards what is obviously what the total handle is, and then we look at certain flag, you know, sort of tentpole events, like what Benjie mentioned when we had the special promotions on Thanksgiving.
And then when we launched for the beginning of NBA, and also tonight, when we're starting in with the NHL, as you mentioned. And we see the number of new betters that are coming on board, it's very, very encouraging for us, but we don't break it out on a state-by-state basis.
Matthew Lee
Right, okay.
Benjie Levy
And Matt, just for additional context, like on the same-store basis, our growth was, what we would expect and really healthy as well - in terms of the comp year-over-year from Jersey perspective.
Matthew Lee
Right, okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe on the media side, I mean, you guys talked about the fact that there was no NHL and NBA season, so naturally your subscriber count was down. And sessions were down a little bit, but you know, revenue was up significantly. So can you maybe help me understand what you're providing to advertisers year-over-year that really push them to, come to the score app and pay more per view?
Benjie Levy
So I think Matt, I can take that one, I think, when you think about some of the dynamics in the market. I think first of all, advertisers were very excited about the return to sports. Second, notwithstanding, the fact that we didn't have NBA and NHL regular season action, we had tremendously strong engagement around the sports that were in season with a monthly active user number that was, more or less in line with what - with what we had last year.
So there was a tremendous amount of inventory. And I think, we saw very strong performances from both our direct sales teams in Canada and the U.S., and that it stems from not just kind of the available inventory, but also some of the creativity and some of the packaging, that we're able to put together, the custom, the custom units that we're able to deliver to our advertisers, and the creative services that we're able to provide to them as well.
So it really is a combination across the board of, sports being back inventory being available and we're really seeing that momentum carry on, now through December and into the new calendar year, as advertisers are looking forward to regular season NBA and NHL, looking ahead to March Madness, which we missed last year. So, couldn't be happier across the board with how our team has performed and how our advertisers have responded.
Matthew Lee
That's fair enough. Okay so, just one last question from me, I'll get back in line afterwards, can you maybe discuss, the Canadian legalization story, in terms of what you believe is going to be the timing and more importantly, how long would it take theScore to, fix up with app in order to be able to launch in Canada post receiving a framework?
Benjie Levy
Listen I think, you never want to predict exactly what the government timeline is going to be, all of the information that we have to-date and the consensus seems to be there's momentum to get this done in 2021, which is something that's very exciting. And for our part, as John said earlier in the call, we're looking ahead, we want to be ready, we're laying the foundation from a platform perspective for that now.
And so again, probably not right to put a stake in the ground and say, exactly what the timeline is going to be here. But we are on it, both from a government relations perspective, and also from a product and platform perspective.
Operator
Your next question comes from a line of Suthan Sukumar from Eight Capital. Your line is open.
Suthan Sukumar
So, the first question from me is on the handle side of the business, on the betting side of business, so obviously impressive handle growth this quarter. Can you just provide some color on the level of cross select activity you saw during the quarter more specifically, are you seeing an improvement quarter-over-quarter with respect to cross app usage and cross sell activity compared to last quarter?
Benjie Levy
I'll take a stab at this and then John or Alvin if you want to add in some color guys, I think Suthan we're still seeing that strong level of cross engagement between our media app and our betting app. And weâre well over half of our users, moving from one to the other. And I think, when we look at what - we rolled out in the fall with Bet section, that was tremendously well received by our users.
That is another significant integration point, I mean our - first and foremost, users live on our block score pages during game time. And now we've introduced another area of the app for them to browse markets, for them to track their bets, for them to get personalized promotions, and to engage around, polling and other community related features. So that has certainly strengthened the interconnection between media and betting, over previous periods.
John Levy
I guess the only thing I would add to that is, we've always considered it as a complete ecosystem, right. And what we've always been looking for is this ability of our betters to seamlessly move back and forth from betting into the media app, and actually making their best without even know which app they're in and that sort of the secret sauce, and the beauty of our ability and the technology that we built into this thing.
And the evidence that we're seeing that that works is by the fact that we use the expression, we're getting better betters, because once we get them, whether they come from Score Bet or the media app and become a better or whether we get them from - through other efforts or through other promotions, and they come in through the betting app, ultimately it's they're part of this overall ecosystem.
And as Benjie said, 50% of all of our betters at least 50% of all of our betters are on both platforms. So that tremendously encouraging for us from a stickiness standpoint and also from a performance standpoint, when we think better betters, it's because they're hanging around longer, and they're betting more.
And it only makes sense, because one of the attributes in sort of the betting world is that not only is there a strong propensity for people to bet on props and for pregame, and all that, but as you're well aware, more and more of it is tending towards in-game wagering. And when you have them part of your whole ecosystem, and they're part of the brand. And they're in looking at data and content reading articles.
And while the game is going on, that it's only a natural fit for them to continue to support their wager or reverse out of their wager or take some other wagers. So, we're very, very excited about the fact that this idea of one-third Score user, and we think over time, what you're going to see is our score users are going to be very, very loyal to the platform that we're offering.
Suthan Sukumar
And then, with this high engagement on the betting side is how is it influencing user growth on the media app? Are you guys seeing any benefit from this on your overall user ecosystem?
John Levy
So I'll take a stab at that. I guess the answer is we expect to see that that the issue is that from where we came from and snapping out of COVID and then seeing that engagement come back strong is what was really encouraging for us. And then you also have to remember that with the sort of sports schedule being completely out of whack right, and we're starting hockey tonight and very, very exciting.
We started basketball, what a week ago football sort of coming to a conclusion at the usual time and so as the NCAA. So from week-to-week, these numbers changed dramatically. So looking at it from above we're very - encouraged about how people snap back to the app. I think we reported something like their engagement 120 times a month. So, snapping back to the high levels of engagement now that they've got something to follow and to look at.
So, I think once this sort of settles and God knows when that will be, sort of living day-to-day with the reality of the world we're in. I think you're going to start to see again, this sort of whole concept of score bet, creating more score users, score users obviously generating score bet. And as the brand becomes more and more extensive, the growth will continue to attribute to the brand.
Suthan Sukumar
Great, great, thanks. Guys, the next question from me itâs on the win margins, theScoreâs, they were negative theScore on both gross and net basis? Can you provide some color here on the delta was this really just kind of more so player fable result and higher bonusing or are other factors to consider?
John Levy
Benjie you want to take that.
Benjie Levy
Sure I mean, listen on a net basis, the delta between gross and net, Suthan is certainly on account of player promotions and that's been consistent with us being in growth mode opening up in new states. And on the growth side as well, it's a similar story. Listen, as we grow as our handle continues to grow, and we continue to scale, we expect our gross margins to continue to normalize.
And there isn't much more to it than that, I think we're very encouraged by - the strong growth in handle that we've seen, and are looking forward to continuing to drive that in the three markets where we're open, opening up Iowa in the coming weeks, and then continuing to build on that from there.
Suthan Sukumar
Great, great and just looking ahead, in terms of new markets, you just touched on Iowa, Michigan, sounds like it's finally opening up as well. And I believe you guys do have market access there. Where's that kind of on the priority list of new markets, you're looking to enter and are there any other states that are in addition to Canada and Ontario, are there any other jurisdictions that you're excited about in the near to mid-term?
Benjie Levy
Listen, I think, there's not any states that - where we have - additional state that we have definitive launch times in. We are very active from a market access perspective, as we look to grow our footprint across the U.S. We have access as you point out in 13 states, currently, between our deal with Monmouth Park in New Jersey, our deal with Jacobs in Colorado, our multi-state market access deal with Penn.
But that's 13 of 50 states, and we are seeing legislatures across the country, accelerate their consideration of sports betting in large part, due to the success they're seeing of the states that have legalized. And also, the impact of COVID on their budgets is driving state to considering maybe doing it down the road to thinking about it now. The other interesting element that we're starting to see is that in addition to sports betting, being considered by legislatures.
iGaming is increasingly being picked up as well, we're seeing in Indiana and Iowa consideration of iGaming bills. Recall that in our agreement with Penn National it includes market access for both sports, betting, and iGaming. And so that would be a natural extension, of our iGaming offering that we're planning to debut in New Jersey in the second half of 2021 as part of our deal with Bally's Twin River.
John Levy
The only other thing I would add to what Benjie saying, because he is generally referencing the fact that things are opening up. We're involved in a whole bunch of very active discussions. I mean, we obviously we can't say anything until things actually occur. But we've always been more aggressive than most in the context of how fast we thought things were going to open up. And in fact I've said this before that things are opening up even quicker than that.
And we're building a team of people who are actively involved in all sorts of discussions and lobbying efforts and for states that have not yet come on board that are potentially coming on board sooner than we anticipate. So, we let it said that sort of A) number one, we're well plugged in all of the active opportunities that are out there. And we're really encouraged by the degree of potential for us to be able to secure now.
Of course, nothing is done until it's done, but we're expecting that over the course of the next whatever hopefully there's going to be more and more states coming on board and we're going to be able to participate.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of David McFadgen from Cormark Securities. Your line is open.
David McFadgen
Would you guys care to venture when you might see the win margin go positive and maybe even be mid single-digit?
Alvin Lobo
I would say that we're seeing good progress. And a lot depends on additional states opening up and promotions and efforts that we're making in a state-by-state basis. And I think David, the short answer to that is, we're seeing progress, we have targets for what we want to achieve. We know what it's going to look like when we get there. Because, that's the way the industry develops and that's the way it is across the board.
And I can tell you it arenât going to take years to get there. And it's probably not going to happen in the next month or two. So, we're continuing to build - the momentum is working in that - in our favor. And I don't think I can be any more specific than that. But we're starting to see encouraging results as we gain momentum in the states that exists and hopefully in the new states that come on board.
David McFadgen
And maybe and just another question and you gave a forecast for Canada for GGR of $3.8 billion to $5.4 billion. I think those were U.S. numbers just asking for clarification there. And secondly is that a combination of sports betting and casino or is that just sports betting?
Alvin Lobo
It is U.S. dollars hey, David. And it's a combination of both sports betting and iGaming and look that forecast is really just extrapolating the adult population in Canada. And looking at basically mature market, sports betting and iGaming GGR markets, and similar, similar sort of mature markets like, I wouldn't even call New Jersey immature market. Yes I think there's still some ramps there.
But in places like the UK, Australia as well as New Jersey, it's just extrapolating from more mature markets to what the growth potential we think is in this market.
David McFadgen
Like would it make sense, in your opinion, to apply a 10 to one ratio Canada, U.S. and just or the other way around U.S. Canada - because often people will do that. And I don't know in your opinion, would that make sense to do that and for this - ballpark estimate?
John Levy
David, under normal circumstances, I would say that's right. I don't and I'm not trying to lead you in one direction or another. I think when we look at the two markets we look at the dramatic differences in terms of our reach, and our brand recognition. And look everybody in Canada knows theScore. Everybody who's on mobile apps uses theScore, if you add up TSN, Sportsnet, anybody else they don't even come close to us.
And the guys that you think are going to come in - that we think are going to come in and compete in hopefully an open market environment, which I think that's what's being
sort of suggested in Ontario. Nobody's even close to us. So, I'm not encouraging you to do more than 10 to one or less than 10 to one, I'm just saying, when we look - and try to think about how powerful the brand in our company is going to be.
We have the pole position here. It's a lot different than in the states and in the states we're making great progress, but here it's completely different. They're basically coming after us. We're not coming after them down there. So, we look at what the numbers are, and we take our best guess as to what sort of market share and market penetration we're going to be able to achieve. And all I can say is it looks like it's a very, very exciting opportunity for us.
David McFadgen
No, no I understand. But the $3.8 billion to $5.4 billion that's a market size. And you would obviously take whatever share you take. But that's the market size. And I was just wondering, that is the market size cracked. I'm just wondering if you can compare market size, the U.S. market size in Canada on a 10 to one ratio so?
John Levy
Oh, just the market size?
David McFadgen
Yes.
Alvin Lobo
I mean, David, again like if you extrapolate, if you look at GGR per adult numbers for sports betting and iGaming, and you do the math, like if you assume 90% of - whatever the adult population is in the U.S. 250 million, 260 million or so. And you multiply that by those GGR per adult numbers, and you assume that somewhere between 85% and 90% of that population, over time will live in jurisdictions where fully remote online sports betting and iGaming is legal.
Then I would surmise that you get to that sort of extrapolation, it's just math again, when you're comparing 29 or so million Canadian adults relative to whatever that ratio is in the U.S. So it's probably not quite 10 to one, it's probably seven to one or eight to one. But again this is all, we're just talking about math, I'm not exactly sure what the exact numbers are - on a one-on-one basis for however many adults there are in Canada, relative to the U.S.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Lee from Canaccord. Your line is open.
Matthew Lee
Can you maybe give us some color as to the amount in which the social media segment is driving revenue? Obviously, you're seeing great growth there. And you mentioned that there is some advertising attached to that. So, could you maybe tell me how much or tell us how much advertising revenue is coming from that segment?
Alvin Lobo
Yes, listen Matt I think, look the ad sales are still dominated by our app. But we are seeing increasing growth both on our social media side, and also on our esports side, where we're now seeing advertisers come to the table with five figure and six figure deals. So, we're now getting beyond the stage of social media being and add on to an existing sale. And these are sales that are now starting to take place as campaigns in their own right, with custom content being created.
And specific content and deliverables being put against those campaigns so - still its app dominated, but these are growing into meaningful contributors.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes to the line of Anthony oh, sorry.
And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Alvin Lobo for some closing remarks.
Alvin Lobo
Thanks, Rob. And thank you everyone for joining us for our first results of fiscal 2021. We look forward to presenting to you again when we deliver Q2 results in mid April.
