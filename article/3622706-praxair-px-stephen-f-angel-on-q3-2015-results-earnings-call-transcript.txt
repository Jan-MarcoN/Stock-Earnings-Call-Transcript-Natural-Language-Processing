Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Praxair Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce you host for today's conference, Director of Investor Relations, Kelcey Hoyt. Please go ahead.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Mallory. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Steve Angel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
In addition, please note that our discussion of earnings for the third quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes charges taken related to cost reduction actions and a pension settlement. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.
On today's call, we will start with an update from Steve on the current business environment, the actions the company is taking to protect and grow profitability in this challenging macro environment and the continued drivers of earnings growth. Matt will then provide a summary of the third quarter results and an update on capital allocation and earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Kelcey. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with North America and begin with our largest market, the United States. Our volumes to the steel industry were weak in Q3, down about 9% year-over-year, as our customers continue to be victims of cheap imports and oversupplied global steel market. The cutback in oil spending also contributes to this weakness. We expect this trend to continue throughout Q4.
Our hydrogen volumes to the refining industry look pretty good. Spreads are good for refiners. They're making a lot of money in exporting product. Planned turnarounds in Q4 will lower volumes somewhat. Chemical industry volumes were down in Q3 due to some customer outages. Those customers are back up and running now. The underlying volumes look soft to me, though, something to watch going forward.
Manufacturing has clearly weakened. Our PDI packaged gases business is certainly indicative of this. Hardgoods volumes were down double digits. I'll remind you, we're not in the hardgoods business for the sake of selling hardgoods. We are in the hardgoods business to sell gas. Cylinder gases are flat. Practically every market category we follow was negative year-over-year, including metal fabrication, machinery, agriculture and transportation. However, our CO2 business, which largely served the food and beverage industry, is doing quite well as we bring on new sources. And our new CO2 business continues to grow.
Canada is in a recession. The west is struggling with weaker commodity prices. Our oil well services volumes are down about 40% year-over-year. Packaged gases are down in the high teens. The east is doing better with the weaker loonie but not enough to offset the west. Mexico, outside of Pemex, where we have seen nitrogen-pumping services for the oil industry drop 60% year-over-year. Outside of that, we're doing quite well. We're seeing solid growth, mid single digits from growing automotive, aviation and general manufacturing markets. Of course, the weak peso helps with export competitiveness.
Europe is generally doing better year-over-year. Pipeline volumes to the steel and chemical industry are higher. Merchant liquid volumes serving general industry in Western Europe and Spain are doing better. And we started up our project with NTMK in Russia, and those plants are performing well.
Asia is four countries for us; Korea, Thailand, India and China. Korea's doing well because of electronics growth. The remainder of the economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, is struggling. Thailand, which is focused on CO2 and food freezing, is doing very well. In India, growth is in the high single digits, as that economy emerges from a recession and the Modi feel-good effect continues. In China, which represents about 6% of our total sales, our volumes are essentially flat year-over-year. Metals is soft as a result of the pull-back in fixed capital spending. Chemicals is flat and general manufacturing activity is flat as well. Positives would be electronics any environmentally-related activity.
South America. Obviously, Brazil is in a deep recession. Industrial production is down 9% year-over-year. Auto production, for example, is down 30% year-over-year. Political uncertainty contributes to the 35% devaluation of the real that we have witnessed so far this year. You've heard me say this before, but I think the situation in Brazil will most likely get worse before it gets better. And that is our expectation for Q4. The good news is we've already absorbed most of the pain. Brazil was 18% of our sales in 2011. It's down to about half that number today. And we always grow at a rate faster than industrial production through increased applications of industrial gases, especially in food and beverage, healthcare and environmental. And even in the worst of times, we can hold about 20% operating profit to sales.
So given all that cheerful news, what are we doing about all these cyclical headwinds we are facing, many of which are blowing at gale force? Please turn to page four. The first order of business is to continue to optimize the base business. Continued price realization is an important part of that, and most businesses are delivering positive price.
Since last year, we've worked hard to make our organization leaner. It's certainly not anything we wanted to do, but given the market weakness we are seeing in South America, Canada, China and all regions affected by weak commodity prices, we have had to take these difficult actions. By the end of next year, our overall head count will be down approximately 7% from the beginning of this year. And as a result, we will be well positioned to leverage any economic growth we see to the bottom line.
Productivity continues to be a positive story for Praxair. Every year, we find new sources of productivity that enable us to sustain our performance and I'm confident that we will continue to do that going forward. And it is the combination of price and productivity that enables us to continue to grow operating profit faster than our top line.
Today, we have quite a few acquisition opportunities in front of us that will allow us to do two things. Number one, build density in key geographies like South America, Canada, Europe and the U.S; and number two, increase exposure to more resilient growth markets like food freezing. Our pending acquisition of Yara's CO2 business in Europe is a good example of the type of acquisitions we're targeting. In the next six to nine months, we expect to close more than $500 million of acquisitions, which will all meet our investment criteria.
Beginning in 2017, we expect to see heavier contributions from the backlog. This is a simple function of project timing, as several large projects like, North West Upgrading in Canada, the CNOOC refinery in China, and the Yara, BASF ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast all come on-line. Today, North America represents 40% of our backlog. Given the declining level of proposal activity in China and Latin America and the high level of activity we are now seeing in the U.S. Gulf Coast, I do expect to see the backlog remain at healthy levels. But the composition will shift more towards North America and away from emerging markets.
All the headwinds we are facing, currency, both translational and its effect on U.S producers, Brazil and upstream energy are all cyclical in nature and will turn at some point. Far be it for me to call that turn. All I know is that when they do turn, we will go back to double-digit EPS growth. In the meantime, what should you expect from us?
First of all, let's assume volume is flat and currency is flat. Unfortunately, the current run rate of both suggests to me continued headwinds in the first half of next year. But assuming flat, my answer would be high single digits. How do I get there? Price, project start-ups and acquisitions will generate mid single-digit top line. Price and productivity will lever that further to higher levels of operating profit, and share buybacks will add another 2% or so to EPS. That is high single-digit EPS.
We'll have time to take questions later, but now I would like to turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks and good morning, everyone. As Steve mentioned, we continue to see challenging conditions in key markets around the world. Despite this, we had a solid quarter, as many of our previous management actions are mitigating the weaker volumes.
Looking at slide six, you can see our consolidated third quarter results. Foreign currency translation continues to be a headwind by reducing both sales and earnings 11% year-over-year. While we saw some underlying sequential growth due to project start-ups, we're still seeing negative year-over-year base volumes from weaker overall conditions in South America and lower volumes to energy and metal customers North America.
The vast majority of these customers are under contract so these volume headwinds are cyclical and ultimately will recover over time. And although the lower volumes have hurt our operating margins, we've more than offset that with higher pricing and strong cost controls. For the quarter, we were able to improve our operating and EBITDA margins to 23.1% and 33.7% respectively, which both represent all-time highs. So we are seeing the benefits of our restructuring actions. And we expect to retain them going forward, regardless of end-market conditions.
In addition to higher-quality earnings, we continue to generate strong free cash flow. Our third quarter operating cash flow of about $700 million more than covered our $400 million of capital expenditures and our $200 million dividend. We were able to deploy additional funds towards share repurchases and reduce our overall share count. In fact, we've been very disciplined and consistent on our capital allocation process for many years. Given the importance of this, I'd like to further discuss them in connection with the near-term outlook provided by Steve.
Turning to slide seven, you can see a simple diagram of that process. Capital allocation starts with operating cash flow. We need to manage all aspects to maximize this figure as much as we can. Our current operating cash flow is about 25% of sales, and it's fairly consistent given the contractual nature of our business.
Once we have the cash, we could three things with it: invest for growth, give it back to shareholders or reduce net debt. Our priority is invest for growth. But these investments need to be in our core regions and meet our disciplined investment criteria. This is true for both organic investments and synergistic acquisitions. We use the exact same approach.
We don't invest to grow sales. We invest to grow earnings and cash flows. Our after-tax return on capital has consistently been in the double digits, and our priority is to allocate more capital toward growth as long as the risk level is acceptable. As Steve mentioned, we're not seeing as many organic projects meeting our risk/return hurdle as we had in prior years. However, we're starting to find more acquisition opportunities, given attractive valuations and the stronger U.S. dollar. So we're shifting towards synergistic deals, primarily serving more resilient end markets such as our recent announcements with Yara and Tecnogas.
Our operating cash flows are strong enough that we have ample free cash after growth investments to distribute back to shareholders.
Our dividend policy's quite simple: we strive to grow it every year. And that is exactly what we've done for 22 years since our inception. And in years like 2015, where earnings growth has been challenged, we still grew the dividend 10%, due to our confidence in free cash flow generation.
The remaining cash that we have after growth investments and dividends is directed toward stock repurchases. When our end markets and geographies are in lower growth modes like today, we actually generate more free cash flow, since the majority of our capital spend is toward growth projects that are only initiated with executed customer contracts.
The balancing factor in any capital allocation process is net debt. Our goal continues to be holding the net debt level roughly flat with 2014. While debt slightly increased this quarter, it was mostly due to timing and we intend to lower it by year-end. So our approach is to continue to fund growth and dividends with existing operating cash flows and use any remaining balances toward share repurchases.
Over the next few quarters, we anticipate more capital allocated toward accretive acquisitions, which would temporarily reduce our stock repurchases. Once these acquisitions are completed, we expect to resume our share buyback program.
And finally, we intend to maintain our A investment-grade rating. This rating provides us the optimal balance of low-cost funding and sufficient flexibility within our capital allocation process. And while some leverage ratios like debt to EBITDA and debt to capital have eroded due to the accounting impact from foreign currency translation, our free cash flow generation is as strong as it has ever been, allowing us to issue some of the lowest coupon bonds in our company history, as evidenced by our recent debt placements.
I'd like to wrap things up with the fourth quarter guidance, which you'll find on slide eight. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.52, which results in annual guidance of $5.78 to $5.85. Both periods include an estimated currency headwind of about 11%. Excluding currency impact, our full-year EPS is expected to grow 3% to 4% over 2014. So despite all the challenges, we are still growing underlying earnings and generating strong cash flow by proactively managing the things we can control.
I'd now like to open up the line for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you, Steve. Thanks for your update on North America. Sounds â it is a tough market. When would you expect volumes to turn positive, back half of next year? Is that reasonable?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think that's an excellent question. Now, you got to keep in mind I think what affects â there's two major factors that I talked about. One was oil prices and the effect that, that has had with the cutback in spending in oil; and also the strength of the dollar. So if those two were to change, if the dollar were to weaken and oil prices were to move back up â and these things tend to be interrelated, I think you would see a boost in metals. You would see a boost in manufacturing. So what I'm really telling you is, until we see some change in those two macro factors, I don't expect much in the way of growth in the back half of next year.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just on pricing in this challenging top line environment. How are your price increases progressing in North America? And what's been the impact of the weaker end market demand?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well I think â let me just say pricing environment's, I look around the world, is pretty good. I look at North America, and we did announce some price increases this year. That's something we'll probably continue to look at going forward. But I think the price environment, particularly given relatively weak capacity utilization around the world is pretty decent, with the exception of China, where we have a lot of oversupply; probably around 50% capacity utilization in the merchant liquid sector and a dozen or so players.
So that's an area where we've been struggling with price, where the entire industry is, I'm sure, been struggling with price. But other than that, I think the pricing environment is pretty much as it has been.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Can you talk about how much of the Europe volume improvement was related to the new project start-up in Russia? And also comment on what you're seeing in terms of volume growth in the packaged gases business in Europe.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Certainly. A lot of the volume growth that we saw, probably half or so, that 3% you're looking at was due to large project start-ups. With respect to packaged gases, I would say it looks pretty decent in Germany and the Benelux. Still pretty flat to me in Spain. That's the one mode of supply in Spain that's not performing as well. The on-site's doing much better. The merchant liquid is doing much better. But I'd say packaged gas is pretty much flat. I don't expect much change in that regard.
And then with Italy, Italy would be a little weaker. And then of course, when you go up into Scandinavia, in these oil-dependent economies, the packaged gases are fairly weak there, too.
But on-site, with respect to metals, chemicals, broad-base manufacturing that we serve through our merchant liquid business still look pretty good.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. And then maybe just kind of another question on pricing. In South America, the pricing momentum seems to be slowing. Is that just a factor of, you've seen so much inflation and it had to slow, just the law of large numbers? Or is it a sign that we're starting to struggle to keep pace with inflation given the weak demand environment?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well inflation for us in Brazil is power, which we address largely through pass-through; and then fuel, likewise. And then the rest of the inflation picture is salaries. So our inflation is not as high as is publicized. We don't import products, so we don't suffer that problem. And we don't have an issue with any other feedstock costs that are inflating. Again, inflation for us is salaries, power and fuel.
So I would say going â we did a pretty good job this quarter, I think, on the pricing front. I think we'll continue to push that going forward. It is a very weak economy and we do have competitors, so that will put some pressure on us. But I do expect to continue to see pretty good pricing going forward. And the combination of pricing and productivity will take care of whatever inflation we see.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Yes. Just wondering...
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Don.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hi. What kind of benefit are you getting from lower net gas in terms of your margins? If you could just quantify that. And then, Steve, Praxair's always had a great record at taking costs out quickly, but do you have to add costs as business comes back in different geographic areas?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So the answer to your first question, of the 50 basis points improvement that we saw on operating margin across the top of the house, I'd say most of that probably was lower natural gas. Now that doesn't take away from the great performance that we've had from everybody around the world to be able to grow operating margins in environments where volumes are weak. So we feel pretty good about that performance. But I would say â and probably most of that 50 basis points â 30 basis points, 40 basis points, something like that, were â you could attribute to lower natural gases.
To your question, yes, we've taken out a lot of cost. We're still taking out cost as we go into next year, which will help, obviously, from a earnings per share standpoint next year. As volumes come back â and I think those of you who have followed us and back to 2009 â you know that we're pretty stingy in terms of how we add cost back. And I think that's â because of that, we're able to get pretty good leverage or very good leverage on any kind of incremental volumes on a very lean cost structure. And we're very conscious of that.
So obviously, if volumes start to pick up quickly, we can respond quickly. So nothing we've done is going to take away from our ability to capitalize on any recovery we see. But we will be stingy in terms of how we add those costs back.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
And then just as a follow-up on PDI, normally weakness in hardgoods is the leading indicator that gases demand going forward might not be that strong. So is that analogy still valid with double-digit hardgoods declines? Or is this more in big equipment items like automation, et cetera?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, for us, it was heavily impacted by the pull-back in oil well services. And we do provide a lot of hardgoods into those regions, both in the North Central and the South Central. And this lead-lag kind of question has come up before. I went back and looked at some of our history, and I would say that most quarters I looked at it looked to me like hardgoods and gases moved pretty much coincidentally. And that in a few quarters, it looked like hardgoods might have led the gases' decline maybe by a quarter or so.
So I don't anticipate any big drop-off in gases as a result of the hardgoods becoming weaker. We could still see some pressure going forward. But basically as I look at Q4, I'm pretty much expecting the same thing that I saw in Q3, both from a hardgoods and gases standpoint.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. Thanks, Steve.

Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for your merchant utilization rates by different regions. You've already given China, just the other regions.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'm sure I could give you a sense of it. I'd say in the U.S., LOX/LIN, which are our two primary products, are around mid-70%s. Argon would be a higher utilization in Brazil. Looks like about low-80%s, LOX/LIN. Europe would be in the high-60%s, 70%-ish, let's call it. China, I talked about. India would be low-70%s, mainly because we just started up a large plant there and we have some merchant loading to go through. And then Korea looks to be low-80%s.
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thank you. And on your return on capital, how do you see that trending over the next couple of years?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
A lot of that's going to be a function of what happens to the top two â the numerator, which is operating profit, normal operating profit after tax. So if we get some volume recovery around the world, obviously, we're well positioned to take advantage of that and we'll get nice leverage. And that'll move the ROC up.
The capital base is affected, as we've had some large projects that have been ramping up. Anything that's had merchant liquid â and a lot of projects in Asia have had merchant liquid. It's been slow to ramp. So that affects the ROC. And also, we did a large acquisition, NuCO2 in 2013. And with acquisitions like that, you're looking at the better part of 10 years before you're able to get the return on capital neutral to the corporate average.
And I think going forward, as we do some of these acquisitions â we're not talking about a ton of money; maybe $500 million, $600 million or so â that does have a bit of weighing-down effect on the overall return on capital because again, acquisitions take longer to become neutral to the ROC than capital projects do.
Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. Just three quick ones. It sounds as if â when you did the walk around the world, how large is the risk of volumes being negative in 2016? Secondly on the CapEx, the backlog to sales ratio. Is there some level below which you would characterize it as not being healthy and that you'd be concerned about it or there'd be an implication? And third, some of the downstream customers seem to be starting to indicate that they think the next investment cycle might start around 2018 to 2019, where they have to start making decisions for the 2020 to 2025 growth period. Does that match with the way you're thinking about the cadence of a possible shift in the cycle, or can you shed some color on that?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
All right. So your first question's about next year. Now we're going to be going â getting into the planning process next week, and certainly, we'll give guidance in January for next year. But we are going to have some project contributions. That's for sure. I think you could have negative run rates on volume in the first half and, of course, the second half comps would be better. So I'll wait and answer that question in January. But it looks to me like we're certainly going to have pressure on the first half, but large projects are going to help for 2016.
With respect to backlog, is there a point with which it's no longer healthy? I think $1.6 billion is fine from a backlog standpoint. As we look at contributions from the backlog going forward in the future, a lot of it is kind of based on project timing. Maybe this year is a percent or so; next year's a couple percent. And then as we get into 2017 and 2018, 3%-ish looks more reasonable to me in terms of contributions from the backlog.
And again, I think that â I'm too worried about it dropping much below that. Again, this is just a function of the amount of activity that we're seeing today in the Gulf Coast. And all those projects are large. So hydrogen supply, carbon monoxide supply, they tend to be very large capital projects. And there're a half a dozen or so that we are â that we're working on today.
With respect to what's going to happen out in 2018, 2019, I don't really know the answer to that, Laurence. I just know that what we're working on today is going to carry us, certainly, through 2017 and into 2018. And then the projects that we were to close, it would be probably second half of 2018 before we'd have the chance to start anything up. More likely, will be out into the 2019 kind of timeframe.
So that's about as far out as I'm willing to project. But to me, looking at the activity, I think for the next three or four years, I think we'll be in pretty good shape.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Steve, when you think about South America longer term, what do you think about growing that business? Where do you think earnings can get back to? And historically, Praxair's been really good about choosing geographies and investing in certain geographies when it makes sense. What's sort of the plan for South America going forward, given the difficulties, the economies there are?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So obviously, today, we're very much hunkering down, been taking cost actions, taking advantage of some good growth opportunities in areas like healthcare, food and beverage, environmental. There are some acquisition opportunities both in Brazil and the rest of South America today. And this is where â we talk a lot about the negative effect of a strong dollar, but this is actually where the dollar helps when we start looking at some of these acquisitions.
I've said that pretty much in the worst of times, we can still hold around a 20% operating profit quality business. I think when they can see some growth â first of all, they got to get stability in the political arena. They need to get the physical house in order. But as I look at kind of Brazil long term, you have a lot people that were lifted from the lower rungs of society, say, into the middle class.
I don't think they want to go back. The institutions there are democratic. They have a democracy. They have pretty sound institutions. They're transparent. They have a lot of resources. They have some industries that are competitive on a global stage. What I really think Brazil needs long term is to have more Embraers, more companies like JBS meat packing. Companies that can compete on a global stage; they just need more of those kind of industry champions long term.
But as far as â people ask me when I think Brazil is going to turn. My answer would be, I think the next logical inflection point would be the 2018 election because the current party will not be in power when that takes place. And I think that is probably about the time that we're going to start seeing more confidence in the future. And a lot of what Brazil is suffering through today is a crisis of confidence.
So it will happen. They will come back. They always go through cycles, and they always come back very strong. And when they do, obviously, our volumes, you'll see that in our volumes; you'll see that in pricing' you'll see a much stronger currency. We'll get tailwind from that, and we'll be operating around a mid-20%s, I'd say, operating profit to sales. But that's not going to happen for a few years. Maybe I get surprised on the upside. I tend to be a skeptical kind of person. That's kind of how I see Brazil.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And then when you think about the factors affecting the U.S. in terms of industrial production, lower energy cost and stronger dollar, do you think those have sort of bottomed out now in terms of demand? Or do you think there's another leg down the next couple quarters or the effect of those on U.S. industrial demand?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well I think as far as the macro factors that I described, I think we're going to see that for a while. I think long term, U.S., you have to be bullish on the U.S. â and it's hard for me to be bullish on anything but I think â I would say bullish on the U.S. for a couple reasons. Number one, if you look at investors around the world today, the U.S. is the emerging market compared to all other so-called emerging markets. And the U.S., obviously, has much lower risk. So the U.S. market is very attractive. Energy costs are very low. And I look at electricity rates in the U.S. compared to other parts of the world that we participate in, and the power rates, electricity rates are lowest in the U.S.
You would expect that at some point, the U.S. is going to start building out or upgrading its infrastructure. And that's going to be very positive for the economy. So I'd say medium term, long term, you got to be a bull on the U.S. But short term, we got some macro factors that we have to deal with. I've talked about energy. I've talked about the effect of the strong dollar. And we certainly are affected by that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks very much. I was looking at your return on capital calculation, and your return on capital is about 12.5%. It was more or less the same thing a year ago. But what's happened is your equity is about $4.3 billion and it used to be $6.9 billion. And you've bought back some shares and you pay a dividend, but you earn $1.5 billion a year. And so what's happened to your equity is your other comprehensive income because of currency translation has pushed that number down. But it makes it look like your return on capital is flat in a world in which you're investing $1.5 billion a year and your operating profits are going down. So in general, what do you think your real return on capital is? And do you find that calculation economically reasonable now?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm going to turn that over to Matt. Let him answer.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Hey, Jeff. How are you?
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sure.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Believe it or not, we've actually modeled exactly what you're saying back in history. What you tend to find is this: the CTA to your point will reduce the denominator. But remember, you also have translation reducing the numerator. And while the timing may be different because the numerator will be average rate, the denominator will be end of rate balance sheet, over time they catch up.
So what we tend to find is in a longer period, a couple quarters strung together, currency impact tends to be sort of washed. You will see it on an instantaneous metric and you will see it kind of in a sort of quarterly metric. When you do like we do, an average over five quarters, currency kind of works its way out.
So I still think it's a valid metric. But as Steve said, the best way to grow this for us right now is to grow the numerator. We've been doing, I think, a pretty good job to keep the denominator in check. We've been doing a good job to mitigate in the numerator some of the headwinds on the volumes, but we're looking to try and grow this out in the next few years to get this number up.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then as my follow-up, how much of your debt is variable rate and how much is fixed?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
80%. 80% fixed, 20% variable. Is that right, Matt?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty close to that metric. We have some swaps that are maturing here that'll put us a little more fixed in the next four months. But right now, yeah, we're probably 80%/20%.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you so much.

Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Steve, you mentioned that North American backlog is 40% of the total, and you expect it to grow. How much of that growth is refinery hydrogen? And where do we stand on the chemical backlog with all the activity that's going on in the Gulf Coast? How much of that opportunity can you capture?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's â if I were to split the activity level in North America, I would say it's probably 20% refinery hydrogen opportunities and 80% chemical based. And the chemical-based opportunities would be for acetic acid. They would be for methanol. It would be for MDI, those kind of opportunities. And what's interesting about them is they seem to take a long time to get to closure. It seems like we're always looking at them, and they're going back and refreshing their feeds and so forth.
And it is possible that some of these people in the Gulf Coast are a little bit more concerned about cash today, even though they have very good projects on the drawing boards. But it's our sense that several of these projects are going to break loose. We feel very good about how well we're positioned. And that's why I say I think the backlog can stay up around current levels on the strength of what's taking place in the Gulf Coast, predominantly in the chemical industry, going forward.

Okay. Thank you.

And then when you look around globally in your steel customers or your customers in Brazil, what percent of your customers are below that threshold (41:23) take-or-pay contract? And are they paying? And it a bad debt issue that we should think about? Thank you.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we have quite a few customers and I don't want to â it's not a huge number â maybe a handful or so of large steel producers in places like Brazil that clearly are operating below take-or-pay levels, but they are paying. And that has been our history.

Our next question comes from the line Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Steve, from your prepared comments, it sounds like you're anticipating a pickup in M&A. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about what dynamics are driving that. Is it broad based, or are these just very specific opportunities you guys have been looking at for a while?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well in some cases, we've been looking at them forever. I look at the one with Yara that we'll close first part of next year. We started talking about buying Yara's CO2 business when we formed the industrial gas joint venture back in 2007. So it only took eight years to get it done, but we did eventually get it done.
If I turn to the U.S., look at the packaged gas industry, a lot of people here we've been talking to for years and years and years. And when you're dealing with family-owned businesses, they tend to take a long time to part with those businesses. And sometimes the factors driving it are things like lack of a successor. But we are hearing more and more discussions â are hearing more and more feedback like, maybe now is the right time to sell while the economy's still doing okay, because it could get worse.
And so we're starting to hear, again, more feedback like that. So that's kind of what's driving the opportunities. Some of it is just a function of things we've been talking to people about a long time. And again, maybe there are a few more people now that are thinking now is the right time to get out.
And certainly, you look at a place like South America, you have companies that are struggling. And we're certainly not going anywhere, and we view these as great opportunities to build onto our footprint and take advantage of some obvious synergies.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And maybe just as a follow-up, could you speak to sort of the captive opportunity set? And I guess I mean in both directions. Like on one hand, are you seeing companies looking to de-captivate? Or are you seeing less contract â or less project opportunity in some areas because companies are saying, you know what? Maybe it makes sense in a lower growth environment to keep this in-house?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I haven't seen the latter. I would say our level of de-cap activity's probably the same as it has been. One thing that I'm always cautious of is when you get customers whose financials are not as strong as they were. When they start wanting to talk to you about de-capping an asset, I think you've got to be cautious because we're not in the financing business.
And so we go through every one of those with a fine-tooth comb. To me, it's kind of like acquisitions. You may look at 20 to do two. And in think de-captivations are very much the same. You may look at 20 to do a few because, of course, like anything else that we invest in, we want to make sure that it's â these are high-quality assets, high-quality projects. And we're going to be proud to own them in the future.

Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. Matt, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the $75 million cost reduction efforts from last quarter. I don't know if you mentioned what net benefit you realized in the third quarter and/or what you're assuming for the fourth quarter before you hit that full $75 million rate for 2016?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Sure, Dave. Consistent with what we said last quarter, the expectation is we'll really start to see the bulk of the $75 million here in the fourth quarter. So really, our expectation is year-over-year in 2016, we'll probably recognize maybe three-quarters, a little less than three-quarters of that benefit. And this announcement we just did here for this quarter should give us another $5 million to $10 million of incremental savings on top of that.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. All right. And then on the competitive landscape, Steve, you mention that you're achieving positive price in almost all of your businesses. And I'm just wondering if we can gauge that. How sustainable is that in an environment that is fairly lackluster and maybe getting marginally worse? What are your thoughts on pricing going forward, assuming things don't roll over dramatically?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean we have an organization that is very much geared towards knowing how to manage price. And inflation is something we look at very carefully. And I'm just â I'm confident that we can continue to grow price going forward, at least a percent per year. I think historically to back and look over last â probably as far back as you want to go, we've averaged at least 2% per year. Now we're kind of saying it's 1%-ish, maybe a little better. But I feel confident in that number. And if we could get a bit of a turnaround in a place like China, obviously, we could do better. But the rest of the world's doing pretty well.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Morning. I've been going back and forth between other call, so I apologize if this has been asked. But you've got a competitor spinning off its non-gases business to put a premium on, focus on gases. Could you give us an update on the role of Surface Technologies in the portfolio?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's obviously not strategic to industrial gases. And so it is something that we have looked at from time to time. It's going to be a question of value. It's a strong business and certainly not anything we'd want to give away. But right now, we have some interesting things going on in the PST business. We have a very strong â we have a very interesting deal that we're working on that's going to really increase the value of that business. And so that's how I'd answer that question at this point.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. In what way would it increase the value of the business? Can you at least conceptualize for us what you're looking at?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not going to get into specifics yet. That'll all become much clearer in the coming months.

Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you. Good morning.
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Steve, I was wondering if â there's obviously a cyclicality of the capital spending in the industry. I'm curious if you see any cyclicality to the return thresholds on projects. In other words, as you and your competitors get a little more miserly with your spending, does the scarcity or lower level of bid projects reduce returns? Or does the scrutiny increase returns or does it hold about the same?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm going to answer it that I think the returns are holding about the same as what we have seen in the past. The activity that I â we're mainly engaged in today in North America â what I like about all these projects is they have very solid terms and conditions, very high guaranteed cash flows. So they've been de-risked, to a large extent. But again, I'd answer the question by saying I think the returns are pretty steady with where they've been. And it seems like all the competitors have areas that they're focused on, somewhat different than each other. And I think that's a pretty healthy thing.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And on your CO2 business in North America, it sounds like it's continuing to do quite well. Maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't imagine that the end market in CO2 is all that robust as people move away from carbonated beverages. So is that a function of just increasing and spreading that footprint or density and taking share? Or is there some underlying growth in beer and other things that I'm maybe not counting?
Stephen F. Angel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. No, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I think when you looked at â obviously, soft drink sales are down; carbonated beverages are down. However, anytime somebody opens up a restaurant, they need a carbonation service, and that's where NuCO2 comes in. So even though CO2 volumes themselves could be lower as a result of weaker soft drink sales, the fact that every new location needs a carbonation service means that we're able to grow that business. It is true that the craft brew business continues to grow double digits, so that's been a positive for us.
We've been a bit disadvantaged in recent years in that we haven't had as strong sources of CO2 as we would like. We've solved that all within the last year, so we feel very good about our CO2 business from a source standpoint which is critical to being successful. And then I look at the food-freezing business itself is growing with CO2 and also dry ice. Dry ice is an area that we haven't focused on historically, but that's a market that's growing pretty nicely. And market segments like biopharma are helping to drive the growth in dry ice.

And due to time, our last question will come from David Silver with Morningstar. Your line is now open.
David Silver - Morningstar Research
Yeah. Hi. Thanks. I'd like ask a question about the currency effect and maybe how it works on the global bidding environment. So I hear you talking about how the strong dollar is facilitating some of your M&A targets. But I do wonder about maybe when bidding for global projects, whether we're seeing the persistent strong dollar relative to the euro change the bidding dynamics. So if you could just about how the bidding environment has or hasn't changed, given the movement in the dollar versus the euro in particular. Thank you.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes, Dave. This is Matt. I can answer that question. When we make these investments, like any investment, they're very long term, so we always model currencies, as I'd imagine all bidders do, in terms of what the long-term outlook is. You tend to source and sell in the same currency when you do these projects. You're building a lot of the assets. Half of it is built in local currency for the construction, and then you receive the revenues in the local currency. We use things like inflation protection, and sometimes we'll index to other currencies. So we've done that in all currency environments, high and low.
So long story short, I don't think it's affecting it at all because all of us have considered currency risks in effect in our investment process throughout our history. So I wouldn't say there's any material change on any respect.
David Silver - Morningstar Research
Okay. Thank you for that.
