At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matthew Kolby. Mr. Kolby, you may begin.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks, Lorraine. Welcome everyone to Markitâs earnings conference call to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2015. With me today in New York is Jeff Gooch, our CFO. And participating from Tokyo is Lance Uggla, Founder and Chief Executive Officer.
To set the agenda for the call, Lance will begin by walking through some key highlights during the quarter and then Jeff will cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open up the call for Q&A. As a reminder, the call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the IR section of the Markit website. The press release and supporting documents can also be found on our website.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call may include certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed via our comments today. Information about the factors that can affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F.
And now, I will turn it over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Thanks, Matt. Yokoso, which means welcome in Japanese, as today I am hosting todayâs Q1 earnings call from Tokyo, where I am here to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the opening of our office in Japan, as well as meet some of our customers and spend time with our Tokyo team.
I am pleased to report that we have had a solid start to 2015. Revenue for Q1 was $271.5 million, an increase of 8.2% on a constant currency basis with strong organic growth of 6.1% in line with our long-term financial objectives. We continued to achieve strong profitability with adjusted EBITDA margins of 44.8% and diluted adjusted earnings per share of $0.36. We saw strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in both our information and solutions businesses, which together represents 75% of our revenue. This was offset by a revenue decline in our processing division, mainly due to reduced primary issuance in the loan market, which we flagged in the Q4 earnings call.
Overall, I am very pleased with our business performance. We remain well positioned to benefit from the industryâs focus on reducing costs and the need to comply with a much tougher regulatory environment. Given these factors, combined with our high level of recurring revenues, I am confident we are on track to meet our long-term financial objectives of 5% to 7% organic growth, double-digit revenue growth, including acquisitions, and adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid 40s.
As we have discussed before, we have four key drivers of our organic business, providing solutions that reduce cost, helping manage regulatory change, delivering innovative services and cross selling. We have had many achievements during Q1 and I want to give you a few examples of some key business wins that highlight these drivers, starting with one right here from Japan.
Within our solutions division, we have made significant progress in Asia and achieved the cross sell of our analytics platform where a large Japanese bank selected our products for the calculation of collateral and margin now required under Japanese regulations. Also in solutions, our enterprise data management platform continued to experience good momentum, driven by the need for both buy and sell side to manage data effectively. This software platform has been a key driver of organic growth for the segment. In the first quarter, a New Zealand based bank selected our EDM platform to form part of their client on-boarding process, which is a new use case for the software, driven by the need to reduce costs. This win is exciting as it demonstrates the platformâs flexibility and potential to solve multiple needs across the industry.
Over in our information division, our bond pricing products, which helps our customers manage regulatory requirements and reduce costs, continued to gain market share, as we grew the business 40% year-on-year. We are excited about this product due to its potential for future growth, particularly as we continue to cross sell globally. Now finally, within our WSO loan portfolio management business, which is one of the largest products in solutions segment, we launched an innovative cloud-based service in conjunction with our enterprise data management platform. This is our first public cloud hosted offering and an integrated solution that we are increasingly discussing with our buy side customers as they actively look for ways to outsource technology they can focus on core strengths and once again look to reduce costs.
Moving on to the acquisitions, from this perspective in Q1 we agreed to acquire the Halifax House Price Index, one of the leading house price indicators in the UK. Itâs a fantastic brand and we are looking forward to working with the industry to develop this asset. This transaction demonstrates that we are well positioned to win index assets as organizations look to outsource or dispose of the calculation and administration of indices. We continue to review a number of acquisition opportunities across all of our divisions as we look for complementary businesses that will creates opportunity and strengthen our position in the industry. However, we remain highly disciplined in how we deploy our capital. As you can see, we are achieving significant wins across our business, that drive revenue growth in both our mature products as well as our newer initiatives. We have a strong pipeline of new business and potential acquisitions and we expect the long-term secular growth trends to continue to provide us with strong tailwinds.
Now turning to our approach to capital allocation, as we have discussed before our overriding objective is to invest capital to generate the highest returns while maintaining an efficient capital structure. After investing in our existing businesses to drive organic growth, we look to execute acquisitions in order to support that same organic growth over the long-term. As you know we have also executed share buybacks historically in order to maximize long-term shareholder value. We have successfully invested our capital this way since inception and we will continue to do so going forward. And with this framework in mind, today I am pleased to say that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million of our common shares over the next two years. This demonstrates our commitment to driving shareholder value, including offsetting some of the dilution from option exercise and ongoing equity compensation awards.
Additionally, this morning we filed for a potential secondary offering with the SEC. This offering would allow banks that were locked up as part of the IPO to sell some of their shares, which will remove some of the uncertainty around these holdings and increase the free float to help improve liquidity in our stock. These actions will help optimize our balance sheet, will still giving us the flexibility to make strategic acquisitions to drive future growth.
I am going to now hand over to Jeff to walk through the quarter, our capital allocation strategy in more detail. Jeff?
Jeff Gooch
Thanks, Lance and good morning everyone. I will now walk you through our first quarter results in little more detail. As you can see on Slide 7, Q1 has been a solid start to the year. Reported revenue increased 4.7% or 8.2% on a constant currency basis, which excludes the impact of FX movements. Adjusted EBITDA increased, whilst adjusted EBITDA margins remains hanged at 44.8%, in line with our long-term objectives. This is a good result, particularly in the context of the revenue performance in processing, which I will discuss in the later slide.
Adjusted earnings decreased 6% due to an increase in depreciation and amortization charges and higher tax charges compared to Q1 2014. This quarter, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 28%, in line with our medium-term guidance. However, the tax charge in Q1 2014 was below trend creating an adverse quarter-on-quarter comparison. Q1 diluted adjusted earnings per share was $0.36, reflecting the lower adjusted earnings and a higher diluted share count compared to the prior year period. Diluted share count increased 7.3% due to both our higher average share price used to calculate option dilution and option exercises into shares since Q1 2014. We have included for your reference a slide in the appendix with further details on both the share count movement for this quarter and an overview of outstanding share options. The $500 million buyback authorization announced today is intended to allow us to manage share count more actively going forward.
Letâs now talk about organic growth, which is a key measure for us on Slide 8. Organic revenue growth for Q1 was 6.1% and reflects strong growth in both our information and solutions segments partially offset by a revenue decline in our processing segment. Acquisition-related revenue growth for the quarter was 2.1%, driven by the acquisitions of thinkFolio and Tax Solutions in 2014. Adverse FX movements during the quarter reduced our revenue growth by 3.5%, primarily due to the strength year-over-year in the U.S. dollar against both sterling and euros. As we said previously, our foreign currency revenue exposures are naturally hedged to a significant extent by sterling and euro expenses. The revenue currency mix for the quarter remained similar to 2014 at 71% U.S. dollars, 26% sterling, and 3% other currencies.
Now, letâs look at operating expenses on Slide 9. Q1 operating expenses increased by $4.1 million, or 2.9% compared to the prior year. Increases in operating expenses exclude growth, including acquisitions, were partially mitigated by movements in FX. Currency exposure for operating expenses remains similar to 2014 at approximately 57% U.S. dollars, 33% sterling and 10% other currencies.
I will now move on to talk about performance of each of our three operating segments. As you can see on Slide 10, the information segment had a strong start to the year with Q1 organic growth of 6.3%. Pricing and reference data continued to lead this growth with fixed income products again a particular highlight for the quarter. Loan pricing showed double-digit growth due to both the new entrants in the loan market. And as Lance mentioned, bond pricing was also a strong performer, reflecting increased customer adoption and usage, particularly to address the evolving European regulatory requirements. Overall, we continue to see increased demand for our pricing and reference data from buy and sell side customers looking for greater transparency to manage their risks in their portfolios and to meet regulatory and reporting requirements.
Indices showed strong organic revenue growth compared with the prior year period driven by growth in our derivative and bond indices. A number of products with our valuation and trading services subdivision showed good growth in Q1. In particular, portfolio valuations growth continued driven by new business from fund administrators and other asset managers. Our calendar, vote and transaction analysis products also showed strong momentum. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $58.2 million during the first quarter and margins expanded from 46.9% to 48.3%.
Turning now to processing on Slide 11, reported revenue for the first quarter decreased by 6.6%, which includes a 4.2% decrease due to adverse foreign exchange movements, which mainly impacted our OTC derivatives processing business. Revenue decreased by 2.4% on an organic basis, as our loans processing business saw a revenue reduction year-over-year. As discussed in our prior earnings call, we continue to see a lower level of primary loan issuance, which impacted our Q1 2015 revenues. This Q1 revenue reduction was, however, partially mitigated by increased secondary loan trading volumes, which continued to grow period-on-period.
Whilst primary loan issuance firmed up in April and so far in May compared to Q1, we would still expect at this point to see Q2 coming in below 2014 levels. Excluding FX differences, our OTC derivatives processing business continued to perform well. The overall revenue decrease impacted EBITDA, whilst margins for the quarter were 52.5%. Q2 revenue, EBITDA and margin are expected to be lower as a result of the price reductions of $3 million to $5 million per quarter we announced in the last call.
Turning now to our solutions segment on Slide 12, first quarter reported revenue increased by 20.1%, or 14.4% on an organic basis. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was driven by new business wins and growing professional services work across both managed services and enterprise software. All but one of our solutions products exhibited double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. These included our three largest and most established businesses, On Demand, WSO and EDM. On Demand saw good growth in existing customers and increased demand from wealth management firms, WSO benefited from continued growth from new business wins and increased loan assets under management, and EDM continued to grow from the acquisition of new customers.
We also continue to see good momentum in our new initiatives, such as our KYC joint venture with Genpact. We now have seven top-tier banks actively implementing the service and approximately 1,300 buy side customers registered to the platform. The acquisitions of thinkFolio and Tax Solutions during 2014 contributed 7.8% to first quarter revenue growth in solutions. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.7% to $27.8 million for the quarter and margin increased from 32.1% to 33.3%. As with last year, Q1 margin benefited from one-off license-based revenues with our enterprise software business and therefore we expect lower margins in Q2.
Looking now at Slide 13, operating cash flows for Q1 was $60.9 million, a 47.1% increase compared to last year, largely driven by underlying EBITDA growth, beneficial FX movements and improvements in working capital. In addition, option exercise is following the release of post-IPO lockups contributing nearly $18 million in the quarter. These two factors enabled us to reduce net debt by 28.3% since the end of 2014. This decrease in net debt brings our leverage ratio to 0.46 times EBITDA compared to 0.65 times at year end 2014.
Turning now to Slide 14, I would like to say a few words about our capital allocation framework. As we said previously, our first priority is to invest in our existing business to drive organic growth. Secondly, we look for acquisitions to supplement that growth. And finally, we look to use share buybacks to drive long-term shareholder value. We have always said that 1.5 times to 2 times leverage is in our view an optimum level for the business with the capacity to go above this range for acquisitions and then pay down quickly given our strong free cash flow. As a result, the $500 million 2-year buyback authorization announced today reflects our view that we have the capacity both to buyback stock and continue with our M&A strategy as we have done historically.
The $500 million sizing allows us to make use of the cash inflow from option exercises and to dilute new compensation awards and opportunistically to help drive long-term shareholder value. We will fund the buybacks in this program using our existing cash and revolving credit facility, but given the low interest rate environment we will actively consider taking opportunities to term out some of the debt during the remainder of the year.
As you can see from the slide, we have used 36% of our capital allocation to stock buyback over the last 5 years and we intend to continue this capital allocation framework of balancing all three uses of capital. As Lance mentioned, we filed a registration statement for a potential secondary offering this morning to allow some of our bank shareholders to reduce their positions in an organized way. In terms of timing, depending on pricing, market conditions and stock supply we would anticipate executing up to $350 million of the buyback program in the next few months with a combination of transactions of existing shareholders and open market activity. Overall, this program will start to move our leverage ratio closer to our target levels whilst maintaining our ability to active engage in M&A where we continue to see an active pipeline.
I will now hand back to Matt.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks Lance and Jeff. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would like to now open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Paul Ginocchio
Thanks. Lance I am just wondering with the $500 million buyback announced does that mean there is nothing really that large out there that you are looking at for a potential acquisition? Then I have one follow-up for Jeff. Thanks.
Lance Uggla
Okay. Well, actually the M&A pipeline is quite strong and we have been very disciplined over the last 12 months to 18 months, but we have a strong pipeline. The other thing that I would say is the quality of the available assets that we have seen has improved. So I think the overall capital allocation strategy we feel we have ample room for bolt-on acquisitions, which has been our main focus historically. And going forward, we expect that to continue. We are looking for those assets that produce strong synergies, so thatâs a must. We donât want a one plus one equals two. We want a one plus one equals three. We are very focused on return on invested capital to give us our long-term success. And â but with the assets we have now, we produce strong organic growth and we will supplement our strategy where we see necessary and that pipeline is strong.
Paul Ginocchio
Great. It does sound like the pipeline is more bolt-ons than anything one or two that are particularly large?
Lance Uggla
Yes. We like â historically, we would like bolt-ons and we will continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions and stay very disciplined, something we would have to very much hit all shareholder measurements from every perspective for us to consider something outside of that.
Paul Ginocchio
Great. And Jeff the solutions margins keep pricing nicely, is there a lot of headroom if you look across the product portfolio in some obviously lower margin startup products versus some higher margin more mature products there are still obviously growing double-digit, is there still a lot of room for that margin to continue to expand?
Jeff Gooch
Yes. I think, Paul it always can be the battles between the existing mature products, which do show margin expansion, have very strong margin and our investment levels in new products. So I think as we said in previous calls, yes so low-30s, 30-odd percent margin for the divisions are balanced between a bunch of zero and exit margin products and others 40% plus. You saw a good margin for us in Q1, definitely showing good year-on-year trend compared to Q1 last year. One thing I will just highlight, you saw the same for last year, Q1 margins tend to be better than Q2. Thatâs primarily because of the software business we have recognized revenue on acceptance of software for lower products and at the beginning of the year go live, which means acceptance of revenue recognition does tends to be weighted a little bit more towards Q1. So you saw that last year, I suspect we will see the same thing again this year.
Paul Ginocchio
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. On the subject of regulation leading to growth opportunities for you, was there anything in the financial or regulatory improvement act draft, bill, from earlier this week that could lead to some new product creation?
Lance Uggla
I am not personally and Jeff can follow-up. We will say with the exact regulation you are referring to. But one thing I would say is there is probably never a week that goes by in Markit where I am not involved in a discussion where we are talking about a potential for product creation or incremental product changes to meet some new regulation, be that driven from Basel, BCBS 239, which are new risk measures being driven from benchmark principles. I am in Tokyo right now and they are talking about new capital rules and requirements around initial margin and variance margin, so never a week goes by that doesnât drive a discussion. And so I think that tailwind is firmly intact. I donât know if Jeff will say with the regulations you are referring to, but I am not.
Jeff Gooch
Yes. Itâs too early can tell in terms of the stuff has come out this week our regulatory team is very diligently of going through new proposals and growth opportunities. [Indiscernible] anyone so far this week a little bit tied up with earnings. But we are certainly very actively engaged. And generally, you are right Toni these kind of regulations do tend to create opportunities, some times bigger, some times smaller, but itâs certainly a good driver for our business. 
Toni Kaplan
Okay. Jeff again, just one follow-up, can you give us an update on, I guess pricing within the information and solutions segments, are you seeing an opportunity to increase prices or is it sort of flattish? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
Should I pick up that one, Lance?
Lance Uggla
Sure.
Jeff Gooch
I mean generally within information, we did grow through the beginning of the year price increases on some products as we do every year. But generally, we also modified prices in other areas either to get increased volume over our competition. So I think generally speaking, we would still view pricing as overall being flat for us as a business. But similarly on the solutions side, there is a variety of smaller changes there. But I think overall, yes I would still try to view the pricing ex the big processing price change we talked about is probably flat.
Toni Kaplan
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman
Hi, itâs Andrew. I wanted to know about the sustainability of organic revenue growth of over 6% in information. We have had it for a couple of quarters now, and then obviously we had slower growth before that. And so when you go through the drivers of growth, is there anything that feels one-time ish, anything that doesnât feel sustainable, is this really kind of a more of a 4% to 5% growth unit and just recently itâs been more like a 6%, how should we think about the growth profile of this unit?
Lance Uggla
Well, I think historically, Andrew, itâs Lance, we have had very strong organic growth in that division. The recurring revenues are very stable, so thatâs a very strong positive. We have got some good new product development derived data that we have talked about that we have been building out, new indices, strong secular trends in ETFs and growth in our outstanding ETFs against our benchmarks. So we always talk about 4% to 6% in Information and overall 5% to 7% with strong drivers from solutions with a slight offset from processing. Thatâs my general gut feel, and so we are probably at the top end of that range in information. But the three divisions are quite diversified. They regularly offset each other. The other strong thing in information that we are seeing is a very strong cross sell and that continues to drive incremental organic growth.
Andrew Steinerman
Could you just make one comment on how Totem is doing?
Jeff Gooch
Shall I take that one up, Lance?
Lance Uggla
Yes.
Jeff Gooch
Yes. In terms of â the impact of Totem, as we said in the last call, thatâs starting to drop out of a year-on-year comparison. I think the impact of this quarter was only a couple of $100,000, but it was up $400,000 of the exact number. So, it wasnât really a material part of the year-on-year narrative. Obviously, the decision to shut both last year is doing the comparison. That probably took about an 0.9% out of the information growth rate, so X that would have been around about 7%, which is definitely above trend. But we have said it before we donât manage the business by quarters. You will see quarters above, you will see quarters below trend. We are currently looking for medium-term balance, so I think you will continue to see up, down quarters.
Andrew Steinerman
Great, thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik
Thank you. Hey, gentlemen. So, you highlighted a lot of products that were doing well and raise their divisions. Maybe if I can take one on the bond pricing product, it sounded like you guys were very positive about that. Can you just give us some sense of I guess the size you are at, the market opportunity and maybe the competitive landscape as to where you fit in?
Lance Uggla
Sure. So, the biggest player in that particular marketplace for evaluated bonds is IDC. I think collectively, they probably have more revenue than the next three players combined, that will be my estimate, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and Markit. I feel we are still a small player in that, but we continue to grow very nicely. We highlighted some significant growth this quarter. We are at a low base. And I feel we have invested a lot in the reference data, the underlying terms and conditions, and now the quality of our pricing, which is I think at a benchmark level very competitive. And therefore, I hope that we can continue to gain market share. So, I like that business and we have a growing position in that overall marketplace, but there is one very large player.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. And just on the processing division, so the $3 million to $5 million price concessions you are giving to clients, can you remind me â did that have any impact this quarter or is it only beginning the next quarter? And then also if you can just tell us about, I guess, the cost initiatives you guys have talked about in terms of making sure margins donât get completely fraction there?
Lance Uggla
Okay. Jeff, do you want to take that one?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, sure. So, in terms of the Q1 results, there was no impact in that price change. It was effective April 1. So, we will see that first impact in Q2. So, reminding everybody, in terms of your models, yes, that $3 million to $5 million will come out from next quarter of exact amount will depend on volumes and a bunch of other factors. In terms of cost, thatâs been an ongoing initiative since the beginning of last year. We probably got ourselves a bit out of key like getting some of the cost out early and the revenues didnât come out for this year, which is frustrating in terms of year-on-year comparisons, but Brad and his team are doing a great job trying to bringing down costs, but that will be a multi-year effort, some things you can do quite quickly, others require technology rework and that will take several years.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. And just one last one for me, maybe I am just not reading these filings correctly, but in terms of the second read, it sounds like at least F1 has it listed at a very minimum amount and then your buyback â are you going to buyback shares as part of the secondary? I guess I am just a little confused on the details there.
Jeff Gooch
Okay. So, why donât I pick that one up now? We put an initial filing today for $100 million covered side. Subject to SEC review obviously will give more details around that once if we actually launch an offering of the back of that registration statement, but in terms of the buyback plan, I talked about $350 million. We have a variety of net business to use yet obviously in conjunction with secondary. One route other deals with existing shareholders or open market activities. We will use some combination of those three routes to achieve the total, but it depends on the pricing stock supply and other things over next few months exactly will be get done by which method.
Manav Patnaik
Okay, alright. Thanks a lot guys.
Lance Uggla
And just a correction there, Jeff, our announcement was $500 million over two years.
Jeff Gooch
Yes. The $350 million was the timing thing I talked about, but yes. So, yes, you cleared it, $500 million buyback authorization for the board over two years. And I highlighted in my comments, we will look to try and execute about $350 million over the next few months by variety of mechanisms subject to the long list of caveats we have around pricing, stock supply there everything else.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Vincent Hung
Hi, good morning.
Jeff Gooch
Good morning.
Vincent Hung
Hi. Just on the primary loan processing business, what was the year-on-year decrease just in primary?
Jeff Gooch
We havenât disclosed explicit numbers for reason which we also said with the other things around primary secondary split on the other side for loan business, but I think from industry stats, you can probably see the primary loan issuance in Q1 was probably down over 50% compared to last year. And secondly, volumes have been up probably a similar percentage, so we are definitely going to swing in that market. If you look at last year, you saw very strong primary calendar in Q1 and Q2 and then quite down a bit in Q3 and then we will see it in Q4. So, that comparison will get easier through the course of the year in Q3 and Q4, but yes, at the moment, itâs a relatively big number, that was big enough to bring down the overall total.
Vincent Hung
Okay. And in the release in relation to the share repurchase, you talked about incurring indebtedness. I mean what kind of net debt to EBITDA ratio you guys comfortable with?
Jeff Gooch
So, Vince, I will go back to earlier comments. I think as sort of optimal range is about 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to EBITDA, but we are very comfortable going above that range even quite substantially given our free cash flow than looking to pay that back down into that range. So, we donât have a sort of maximum line 3 times, 3.5 times itâs the right thing, it wouldnât be a problem, which is why we feel the $500 million authorization still leaves us plenty of headroom for the right M&A opportunities given the strength of the pipeline.
Vincent Hung
Okay. And last one for me, you talked about the new business wins in bond pricing, what kind of customers are you with?
Lance Uggla
Generally, our customers in bond pricing are sell-side banks looking to use our pricing for product control. And so when we win a sell-side bank, itâs usually under a scrutiny of a market maker, so itâs a big win and usually being taken from one of our competitors. So we have had some of those. We also of course sell through fund administrators to mark-to-market and buy side as well as direct to some of the larger buy side asset managers.
Vincent Hung
Okay, thanks a lot.
Lance Uggla
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee
Hi, guys. Good morning or afternoon I guess depending on where you are. I wanted to ask a question about the information business margins, I know there is a bunch of moving parts in FX impact the numbers, but as we think over the next couple of years, is there like an incremental margin level we should think about for this business? Is it bounce around a lot over the last few quarters and the last couple of years? How do you think about that?
Lance Uggla
Yes, I think itâs a good question, Gary. I think the trouble with predicting margins all depends where the growth comes from. Last couple of quarters, we have seen a lot of growth on existing products, we see loan pricing, where we see very good flow-through, the products fully built out has coverage the margin on cost delivery for new customers actually relatively low. In other periods, we get growth from new products may require consumer investment, in some cases you donât see the same level of flow-through. So, itâs really a question of where growth comes. If we get growth from existing products, you will see margin expansion. If we have to launch new products, then you will see flat margin profile. This was about between the two, which is why we have been cautious about putting out into a guidance that margin improvements in that division. So, I think we still feel lot of information sets we donât provide and we are still looking to expand our universal coverage as well as grow the existing products.
Gary Bisbee
Okay. And then despite you are saying you donât want to give guidance, maybe I will take or comment on that looking forward. I will ask one other comment. You said in the last few quarters you have got this benefit from the existing customers in loan pricing, and obviously you have had terrific margins, but you start to comp against that in the back half of the year, against some real big margin increases last year. Would it be a reasonable way to think about it that as you continue to invest that the margin could decline from those strong levels or are you really unwilling to give any commentary? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
I think itâs a little bit early to say. I mean, certainly we donât have any big investment plans that would significantly bring margins down. We will see the phenomenon as we do stock pay rises at Q1 comes down a little bit lower in information, so obviously at solutions, we get the one-off bump. This is a software revenue recognition, but you tend to see expanding margins through the course of the year ex any other business changes.
Gary Bisbee
Okay. And then in the processing business I understand your commentary about the price change, but do you have any sort of historical perspective you could share with us on how increases in interest rates at some point in the next year or so would impact loan volumes, how should we think about that?
Lance Uggla
Do you want me to take that, Jeff?
Jeff Gooch
Yes.

I guess my personal view in what we would expect to see, so we expect â we saw a lot of primary issuance. I think last year because people thought rates were going to rise. We havenât seen substantial rate rises yet. But generally, in the transition to higher rates, the loan markets we would expect to have more activities. And then more outstanding does create more secondary, so they do go hand-in-hand. We have seen a slowdown in the primary issuance. I am not a forecaster of rates, but I would think that initial strong views of rate rises could encourage an initial issuance of primary, which would then slowdown in the subsequent quarters.

Okay, great, that makes sense. And then just one last one on processing, any update on the success at growing the smaller business is there FX, equities, etcetera, does that continue on trackâ¦?
Lance Uggla
Yes, thatâs â I think the overall exposure of the processing headwinds as we go into this quarter we have taken $3 million to $5 million of that number out of our future, which is good. It becomes a smaller percentage of our overall $1.1 billion of revenues, which is another good thing. And then we are growing the adjacent businesses, FX, process and then equities, continues to grow as we invest in those areas. So I think that overall uncertainty continues to be lessened.
Gary Bisbee
Great. Thank you.
Jeff Gooch
One thing I would highlight the equity business just as an example, did achieve double-digit growth year-on-year, so we are seeing some good growth.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin
Hi, good morning. I apologize if this was answered. I am jumping a little late here. But my first question is it fair to assume absolute cost decreases in 2Q and 3Q versus the first quarter in the processing segment as you have called out some progress reducing costs there?
Lance Uggla
You want to take that, Jeff?
Jeff Gooch
Yes. I think it was the hard one to pull out because the foreign exchange movements in terms of the exact impact in terms of reported costs, but I think we definitely anticipate seeing an underlying trend to slightly reduce costs over the course of the year. I am not sure if itâs a massive number, I donât have the numbers in front of me. But I would say itâs definitely the trend, Andre you are at.
Andre Benjamin
Okay. And then in information, I was wondering if there has been any evolution or conversation with clients around the current bundling and delivery of the data files as everyone is kind of waiting for more products to go onto exchanges and is there any pressure to pursue more of it unbundled strategy going forward?
Lance Uggla
We donât see that pressure at least it doesnât hit my desk as a pressure for us. We do sell products both bundled and unbundled. So they are available in all shapes and forms. And I donât see any pressure really from any of our products in terms of any exchange driven moves to exchange driven products versus OTC. We do have a credit track for a futures contract in place with ice, but thatâs had no open interest developed at all. And the OTC markets with clearing seem to be serving the industry very well, so we havenât seen those pressures.
Andre Benjamin
Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
Yes. I want everybody to think about where our biggest data products actually are, the CDS product is sending one of those which could see an impact, that we donât see anything massive happening. But the other really big pricing the loan pricing was known electronic trading agenda, equity securities, finance, they show interesting equities market, so where the electronic and where that really exists. And as Lance called out in his opening remarks, bond pricing is a very rapidly growing product for us as well though much smaller than those others, but again on that particular electronic agenda such as our pricing services.
Operator
