Good morning, and welcome to Starwood Hotels & Resort's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I would now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Mangas, our CEO; and Alan Schnaid, our CFO.

Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Stephen, and thank you all for joining us on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. In my prepared remarks I'm going to start with a quick review of our fourth quarter results and some achievements we delivered in 2015. Then I'll turn our â to our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. Before turning the call over to Alan, who will go into more detail on our results, I will give you an update on the announced acquisition of Starwood by Marriott International.
In the fourth quarter we delivered strong financial results with adjusted EBITDA of $318 million and adjusted EPS before special items of $0.89, both above our expectations. Worldwide, system-wide RevPAR for same-store hotels grew 2.8% in constant dollars, just below the low end of our guidance range with North America and the Middle East and Africa falling short of our fourth quarter expectations. At our owned and leased hotels, worldwide RevPAR grew 6.3% in constant dollars, above the high end of our guidance range.
It has been anything but business as usual in 2015. With the backdrop of the strategic review process that led to the announcement of Starwood's acquisition by Marriott has been in the headlines, I'm proud to say that during 2015 our associates around the world rallied together to not only rethink how we run our business, but to deliver accelerated growth in the year.
We started the year by engaging our global leadership to redefine our strategy, thinking through where we should compete in the global marketplace and how we can win. And we began to take bold step to execute that strategy. We looked at the way we did business and determined how we could streamline our operations and improve our efficiency. With the cost reduction plan we announced in April, we targeted achieving a run rate savings of $25 million in SG&A and reducing costs in our system funds by up to $60 million in 2015. I'm pleased to tell you that we exceed those goals, reaching a full $25 million of SG&A savings in the year and delivering $70 million in savings for deployment in our system funds.
But that focus on taking cost out of our system did not come at the expense of investing in innovation and growth. Over the course of the year, our teams launched a range of new brand initiatives, stepped up our level of competition in the marketplace and delivered outstanding results. Among the initiatives in 2015 we launched the Tribute Collection, our 10th brand, with 16 hotels either opened or with executed agreements, it's off to a strong start. We took the bold first steps toward reinvigorating Sheraton, our largest and most global brand with the launch of Sheraton 2020. With the new look and feel, Sheraton is capturing the hearts and minds of the corporate traveler and has delivered two consecutive quarters of RevPAR index increases.
Our singings pace has continued to accelerate, and we closed out 2015 with 220 signings for new hotels and franchise agreements, a 26% increase over 2014. This made 2015 our 6th consecutive year of increased signings and also represented the most incremental growth in signings in a year in our company's history.
We attribute these results to the introduction of first, the Tribute Portfolio; second, the work we've done to relaunch the Luxury Collection; and third, the efforts we have made to streamline our development process across all brands. Approximately one quarter of our room signings were for conversions from other brands, up 95% from 2014. We did all this while still holding essentially flat our key money commitments on a per-room basis for incremental deals.
And with 105 hotels and over 21,500 rooms opened in 30 countries in 2015, we achieved net rooms growth of 4.4%, up from last year's 2.1% and back in our long-term target range. We've continued our progress against our asset-light strategy, with over $820 million in gross proceeds in 2015 from the sales of hotels and interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, exceeding the goal we laid out beginning of last year.
With the sale of the Imperial Hotel in Austria earlier this week, our cumulative disposals since we announced our $3 billion goal is now $2 billion. That leaves us with $1 billion left in 2016 to reach our goal, and we're not backing off that target. Importantly, we will deliver another $200 million of disposals with the five hotels we're contributing to the Vistana spin. In addition, we're making good progress in our discussions for a number of potential transactions, but as you know, we don't comment on specific deals until they're complete. Already with our dispositions to-date and the completion of the interval Vistana transaction, we will have met our original asset-light goal with 80% of our EBITDA before SG&A coming from fees.
At our Vacation Ownership business, the team delivered fantastic operating performance in the fourth quarter with originated sales of vacation ownership intervals up 26% and average price per vacation ownership interval up 13%, driven by our Sheraton Flex program and the initial success of sales at the Westin Nanea, our new property in Maui that is under development.
Because of percentage of completion accounting, much of that success with originated sales is being deferred, resulting in a decrease in GAAP revenues and profits in the quarter. But we anticipate recognizing those revenues later in 2016 as we reach key milestones in the development of that property. The spinoff transaction and merger of Vistana with Interval Leisure Group is progressing well, and we continue to anticipate that it will close sometime in the second quarter, subject to Interval's shareholder vote and customary closing conditions. The excellent performance of our team at Vistana gives us confidence that the future of the new and bigger Interval Leisure Group is bright.
Looking ahead to 2016, global RevPAR growth is expected to continue. However, the impact of a weaker global macro outlook has tempered our RevPAR forecast in many markets. As a result, we have reduced our guidance range for worldwide, system-wide constant dollar RevPAR to 2% to 4%, reflecting current trends and a weak start to January in North America and the Middle East.
In light of that lower growth rate, we remain focused on execution. With a global pipeline of 530 hotels, 116,000 rooms, we're targeting another strong year of footprint growth and expect our net rooms growth to remain at our 4% to 5% target range. We're also working to build our pipeline further by delivering another year of record signings.
We continue to be focused on delivering great guest experiences in new locations and delivering value for our owners through our innovative brands and global capabilities. In 2016 you'll see the marketing and advertising drive behind Sheraton 2020 plan continue, and we anticipate announcing the next wave of Sheraton Grand Hotels, recognizing the investment our hotel owners are making in their properties.
We are executing our strategic plan not in spite of the announced merger with Marriott, but because of it. It is the plan Marriott is buying and the plan that will drive the most value for our stockholders, who will own 39% of the combined company once the transaction closes. Our strategy and the interventions we're taking during 2015 address the things we can tackle on our own, but what led us to this deal are the strategic benefits of scale and efficiency of the combined company that go beyond what Starwood can easily address in the near term as a standalone company.
As part of our strategic review, we looked at the travel behavior of our valuable SPG guests and saw that on aggregate they're spending 34% of their travel dollars on hotel stays in the upscale and upper midscale select-serve segments. Moreover, Starwood is only capturing 7% of that spend, while the growth of Aloft and its RevPAR performance have been very strong over the past few years with just over 100 hotels opened and another 100 plus in the pipeline, we've got a long way to go on our own before we get to the 1,000 plus hotel level and see the kind of scale in that category that will let us capture meaningful share of our valuable SPG guests upscale travel spend.
Importantly, looking into the next several years, we expect the select-serve model to continue its growth outside of North America. While we believe our brands will continue to have strength in full service, luxury and upper upscale segments, the need for us to have a strong and scaled select serve offering will only continue to grow. The combination with Marriott clearly addresses this strategic need. In addition, Starwood's full range of distinct lifestyle brands and our significant international presence provide Marriott with a complementary offering to its core brands in the hospitality space.
Scale is important in the Lodging business. In addition to the meaningful cost synergies that will directly impact the bottom line of the combined company, there are also areas of synergy in our breakeven system funds around technology and marketing spend that will allow us to drive system preference from guests and hotel owners. As one company we can fund the technology behind one app, one revenue management system, and one reservation system instead of funding to each. That more efficient use of resources will allow us to deliver greater innovation, generate more top-line revenue, and build guest loyalty further.
We remain very excited about the combination, and as you can see we're make good progress toward a mid-2016 close. In Marriott S-4, which includes a joint prospectus and proxy statement, was declared effective yesterday, February 17, and our stockholder vote is scheduled for March 28. As you can see from the nearly 20 page background on the merger section of the proxy statement, we conducted an extensive process, exploring potential combinations with a wide range of partners until reaching an agreement on the transaction with Marriott.
As Bruce Duncan, our Chairman, noted on the call announcing the deal, Starwood is a strong company with much envied brands, hotels and people, but there's no question that Starwood can benefit from more scale efficiencies. We believe Marriott gives us the opportunity to realize these benefits and the proposed transaction is the best outcome for our stockholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Alan, who will review our results in more detail.
Alan M. Schnaid - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. As Tom noted, we exceeded our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2015 with adjusted EBITDA of $318 million and EPS before special items of $0.89. Our worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR grew 2.8%. Occupancy across our system reached a fourth quarter record of 68.5%. These top-line results allowed us to grow core fees by 3.8% in constant dollars versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Reported core fees, which were impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, were flat with last year but in line with our expectations.
Fourth quarter management fees, franchise fees and other incomes were down 2% versus 2014, primarily due to larger than usual termination fees that we recognized in 2014. Our owned and leased hotels performed very well in the fourth quarter with RevPAR up 6.3% in constant dollars reflecting the strength across most of our owned and leased portfolio. Margins at our owned hotels were up 170 basis points in the quarter and for the full year they were up 110 basis points, which was above our expectation. Earnings at our Vacation Ownership business were $33 million which was also above our expectations.
We held the line on costs during the fourth quarter and accelerated the implementation of the cost saving initiatives we announced earlier last year. SG&A was down 11.9% in the fourth quarter and down 3.5% for the full year, within our guidance range.
We continued to return cash to stockholders in the fourth quarter with dividends of approximately $63 million and share repurchases of approximately $43 million. For the full year 2015 we returned over $625 million through dividends and share repurchases exceeding the high end of our range.
The share trading plan we had in place that allowed us to deliver our full year repurchase goal expired in the fourth quarter, and as a result of the merger agreement with Marriott, which we finalized and announced in November, we have since been precluded from buying stock in the open market.
Now let me give you an overview of our fourth quarter performance around the world, the trends we are seeing and how that plays into our guidance for first quarter and full year 2016.
Starting with North America, fourth quarter system-wide constant dollar RevPAR grew 4.7% and in the U.S., system-wide RevPAR was up 5%, with occupancy of 71.5%. Our hotels performed well gaining 70 basis points of RevPAR index in North America during the quarter. Overall RevPAR trends across North America were mixed. Many markets showed strength, including Atlanta, Minneapolis, San Diego, Orlando and Maui, where our properties saw double-digit RevPAR growth.
On the other hand, the impact of lower oil prices that we saw in certain markets earlier in the year continued in the fourth quarter and RevPAR in the quarter declined in our properties in Houston, Oklahoma City, Calgary and Edmonton. In New York, RevPAR was down just under 1% reflecting continued oversupply challenges. Despite that RevPAR softness, our hotels in New York outperformed their competition gaining 170 point points of RPI in the quarter.
At our same-store company-operated hotels, group revenue in the quarter was up 8% in North America, which was ahead of our expectations. However, that strong performance was offset by lower than expected growth in transient, which was up 1.5% in the quarter.
Looking ahead to 2016, group revenue pace at our owned and managed hotels is up in the low-single digits. We expect group performance to be slightly below last year in the first quarter impacted by the weak conditions in New York and a lower number of city-wide events in Chicago and Boston in the quarter. On the transient side, our corporate rate negotiations have proceeded well, with average rate up in the mid-single digits.
As we said on our third quarter earnings call, we expected October to be stronger â a stronger RevPAR month in the U.S., and that was the case. However, we saw RevPAR growth decelerate in November and December, and that has somewhat continued into January, with RevPAR growth of 1.3% versus 2015, although February to-date is above our guidance range.
Now the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter is expected to put somewhat downward pressure on RevPAR in the first quarter, but for the full year we expect North America RevPAR to grow 3% to 5%.
In Latin America, our hotels in Mexico continued their strong performance through the fourth quarter with RevPAR up 15%. Those results were offset by the weak economic conditions in Brazil and Argentina that created a 470 basis point drag on overall RevPAR growth in that region. Despite the tough conditions in those markets, our hotels outperformed the competition with RevPAR index gains of 450 basis points across the region. Looking ahead our expectation is that RevPAR growth in Latin America will be slightly above the high end of our worldwide guidance range for the full year 2016. So far we have not seen any material impact to our business from Zika virus, but we continue to monitor the situation.
Turning to Europe, RevPAR at our system-wide hotels grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our results were really a tale of two regions with strong performance in the southern markets, offset by weakness in the North. In the South, RevPAR in Italy was up over 10%, and in Spain our hotels grew RevPAR by more than 15%. In Germany, RevPAR at our hotels was flat versus 2014 due to lower trade fair activity and group business. RevPAR in France was down double digits due to the drop in travel following the terrorist attacks in November. And while the Rugby World Cup helped London in October, December was extremely weak, which we also attribute to the aftermath of the Paris attacks.
We expect Europe to be in the middle of our guidance ranges for the first quarter and full year 2016. RevPAR at our system-wide hotels in Africa and the Middle East was down 2.9% in the fourth quarter. Low oil prices have contributed to a pullback in government spending and cancellation of certain oil and gas projects in some markets. Those factors, combined with geopolitical instability in the region, resulted in a 6% decline in RevPAR in the Middle East in the quarter. RevPAR in Africa, however, grew at over 8%. In particular, we benefited from a strong level of travel from China and India to our resorts in Mauritius and a solid group base in South Africa. We expect similar trends to continue in the first quarter of 2016 and for the full year, and we expect RevPAR in Africa and the Middle East to be below the low end of our 2% to 4% guidance range.
Finally in Asia, Greater China RevPAR was down 2.3% in the fourth quarter driven by continued significant declines in Macau and Hong Kong. On the other hand, RevPAR in Mainland China was up nearly 2%. The North region and Beijing in particular benefited from the strong business and group travel, and our properties in Hainan benefited from a strong leisure travel during the holidays in October and December. We expect trends in China to improve later in 2016, as we begin to lap the large declines in Hong Kong and Macau.
In Mainland China we saw RevPAR growth improve late in the fourth quarter. November RevPAR was down 2.9% and December RevPAR was up 8%, and we continued to see that trend in January with RevPAR growth of 7.4%, as once again the hotels are benefiting from the holiday period. For the full year 2016, we expect RevPAR in China to be in the middle of our guidance range.
Performance at our hotels in the rest of Asia was good, with RevPAR up 5.6% in the fourth quarter. Thailand, Japan, Malaysia all had double-digit RevPAR growth. We expect RevPAR growth in the region to be above the high end of our guidance range for the full year.
Based on those RevPAR trends, we expect worldwide system-wide RevPAR to be flat to up 2% in the first quarter and up 2% to 4% for the full year 2016. We expect core fees to grow 2% to 4% in U.S. dollars or up 4% to 6% excluding foreign exchange in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect core fees to increase 5.5% to 7.5% in U.S. dollars or up 7% to 9% excluding foreign exchange. We expect management, franchise and other revenues to grow 5% to 7% in the quarter and 6% to 8% for the full year.
I do want to point out that this growth rate reflects a net decrease of $8 million in the non-cash amortization of deferred gains as a result of the gain from one of the hotels we sold a number of years ago now being fully amortized, offset in part by the amortization of gains from hotels we sold in 2015.
The growth of management, franchise and other revenues also reflects adjustments related to the expected completion of the Interval Vistana transaction, which for purposes of the guidance range and to keep things clean for modeling purposes, we assume to occur at the beginning of the second quarter. Following the completion of that transaction, we will begin recording the license fee from ILG and other within management, franchise and other revenues. We expect the license fee will be approximately $30 million for the partial year period. We expect worldwide RevPAR for owned and leased hotels to increase 2% to 4% in constant dollars or 300 basis points lower in U.S. dollars in the first quarter and 1% to 3% in constant dollars or 150 basis points lower in U.S. dollars for the full year.
For the full year we expect margins at our owned and leased hotels to increase 50 basis points to 100 basis points. As a reminder, the hotel sales completed in 2015 reduces owned EBITDA by $38 million. The Vistana ILG transaction will also result in a reduction to owned and leased earnings of approximately $20 million, due to the impact of five owned properties that will be transferred to ILG in connection with the transaction.
We expect earnings from our Vacation, Ownership and Residential business to be approximately $35 million to $40 million in the first quarter, which is lower than the prior-year period as a result of the continued deferred revenues related to the sales of the Westin Nanea. I do want to point out that this excludes the five hotels transferring to ILG. We anticipate spending $55 million for investments during the first quarter for new inventory, including continued work at the Westin Nanea. For the full year residential earnings are expected to be $7 million.
With the cost savings we've put in place in 2015, we expect SG&A for full year 2016 to be flat to down 2%. Reflecting all of these assumptions, we expect first quarter EBITDA to be $250 million to $260 million and full year EBITDA to be $1.085 billion to $1.11 billion. For the full year we expect depreciation expense will be approximately $280 million, interest expense will be $120 million and we anticipate a tax rate of 32.5%. EPS before special items is expected to be $0.56 to $0.59 for the first quarter and $2.74 to $2.84 for the full year 2016.
We expect to generate cash flow from operations of $800 million to $900 million in 2016. We expect capital expenditures for maintenance and technology to be $200 million, and anticipate $100 million of capital expenditures for development and in-flight projects.
Now before I wrap up my prepared remarks, we do realize that with the asset sales and the planned ILG transaction, it is difficult to compare our 2016 guidance to our 2015 results. We have provided the various pieces in our earnings release, but in a nutshell to compare apples-to-apples, our full-year 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $1.197 billion should be reduced by $117 million of earnings from our Vacation Ownership business for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarters of 2015. By $20 million representing the lost earnings in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarters from the five properties we are transferring to ILG and by $38 million representing the lost earnings from 2015 asset sales.
Now in 2016, amortization of deferred gains will be $8 million lower than 2015, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the license fee from ILG in 2016 across the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarters will total approximately $30 million. Lastly in light of the Marriott transaction, we are precluded from buying back our stock, and as such, at this time we are not assuming any share repurchases in 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Alan. Despite a lot of change and external noise, Starwood delivered a solid year of share growth, rooms growth and lower costs. We did what we laid out to do at the beginning of the year. Now we're all focused on continuing to win in the marketplace and delivering strong business as we complete our historic merger with Marriott by midyear.
We'll now take your questions.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Tom. We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourself to one question and we'll take any follow-up questions you may have as time permits.
Sylvia, can we have the first question, please.
Question-and-Answer Session

Your first next question comes Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I just wanted to go ahead and try and clarify a few of the comments that you made on just the current quarter-to-date trends, because it seems like there's been some volatility. So it sounded like you said January was below probably what you saw in December and Q4. But could you elaborate a little bit more on February and the bounce you've seen? I mean I appreciate it's only three weeks and these numbers are pretty volatile, but any color in terms of magnitude there would be helpful?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So thank you for the question, Shaun. We did see a decelerating trend in RevPAR and particularly in the Business Transient segment in the November, December period. That continued into January and as we said we saw in North America 1.3% RevPAR growth in January.
Now in the first few weeks of February, we have seen that kind of restore back to mid-singles, but it's not a complete view and again it's really mostly a owned and managed view of the business. We don't have a full view with our franchisees at a mid-month reporting period.
So clearly we've guided in the first quarter a 0% to 2% range because we're not going to assume that the world magically gets better from the trend that we've seen. Frankly we want to make sure we're establishing some creditability here. We've missed our RevPAR range for the last two quarters and we want to make sure that as the business trends are weak, not expecting a hockey-stick improvement here, although we are encouraged by the month of February progress in North America.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Hi. Just as a follow up to that question, some of your competitors are seeing strength in the Corporate Negotiated segment. It's not a huge piece of it, but it seems to be consistent that that's improving at a time when their commentary about the start of the year is actually pretty decent. Can you give us a sense of where you're seeing weakness? And do you have a sense of why your results, at least from a tone perspective, seemed to be a little softer than some of the others that we've heard from today.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Harry. First, I think our North America guidance range on RevPAR is pretty darn close to everyone else's. We're at 3% to 5% range. So I don't think we have a materially different outlook on the year. I think we're reflecting in our guidance range what we're seeing in the business. We are seeing weakness in the energy sector. I mean if you look at our fourth quarter corporates in the energy sector, they're down 33%. Our manufacturing and engineering segments, corporate finance and banking they're down mid-single digits. So that's where we're seeing the weakness there. And those are significant portions of our business. Offset where we see strength in other segments like accounting and consulting.
Look, we built RevPAR index in fourth quarter. So we feel like we're performing well in the marketplace, and I think we're trying be as transparent and credible as we can in our outlooks and not trying shade it one way or the other.

Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. So since the acquisition by Marriott was announced, your stock price is obviously down. Has there been any increased interest from other bidders?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Well, thanks for that, Thomas. So we had a very long and public process and as you read in the background section, we talked to nearly everyone. And I would imagine if there was an alternative deal out there that suitor would likely get pretty public about it. I think generally that has happened. If there was something active that we hadn't disclosed yet, I obviously I couldn't talk about it. But I think that the financing markets have been tight for people who might be looking to access, make a cash bid. The currency of other strategic players in the market have all seen similar stock price declines, in fact worse stock price declines than Marriott/Starwood together. So their currency is less valuable. So I think the economic condition's really not right for, I would imagine, a competitive bid.

Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.
Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi, good afternoon. Is the timeshare sale expected to close on April 1? That based your guidance on â is that in the assumption and is that pretty much where you think you're going to be coming out on this? And then same thing on the pending transaction with Marriott. Is that slowing down the pace of introducing new hotels or getting new bids for people who are interested in building your hotels?
Alan M. Schnaid - Chief Financial Officer
Steve, it's Alan. I'll take the first part of that question on the timing of the SVO, the Vacation Ownership business transaction. For modeling purposes we've assumed April 1 as I mentioned in my commentary. It just makes it easier for you guys and for us, quite honestly, to guide that way. We are still targeting a second quarter close on that transaction. We're getting through the regulatory process and we are still comfortable with that second quarter.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Steven, on the signings pace on the development side, we haven't felt a slowdown yet. In fact, we had a barnburner fourth quarter, including a November and December that far exceeded our expectations, which was after the announcement of the Marriott acquisition. We signed 220 hotels last year, and we're still getting significant conversions behind the Luxury Collection and Tribute. And we're setting aggressive goals this year. And I think the owner community sees strategic merits of the deal and sees significant potential benefits for them to be part of our combined system with a significant pipe, tremendously valuable loyal guests in Marriott Rewards and in SPG, and they want to participate in that. So a long answer to your question, but basically no, we're not seeing a change yet.

Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Tom, you talked about and you highlighted that you built the RevPAR index in quarter and I think you said you gained 170 basis points in New York. Just wondering if you could talk about what you've been doing to generate those results? And if there's any areas in particular that you want to highlight in terms of getting there?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Well, thanks for that, Felicia, and we're very proud that we were able to on the full year basis in each of our six operating regions build RevPAR index and in eight of our nine brands with â year-over-year comparisons. And one brand we didn't build it in was basically flat.
I think Sheraton 2020 is a great example. We've brought some marketing back to the brands. I think one of the team's greatest efforts last year was to drive renewed focus on marketing. We brought in some significant new external talent into our marketing organization and you see a tremendous activation of those marketing plans, whether it's in the Sheraton 2020 marketing campaign that led to RevPAR index growth on that brand worldwide in the third and fourth quarter, or the way we're continuing to drive tremendous connectivity with our guests on Westin behind our wellness proposition. So it's the activation I think is what's drawing our guests in.
And certainly their hotel teams are executing and we've put a significant focus on our Guest Experience Index, which is a measure that tracks how guests are finding their experience there, and rewarding our GMs on improvement in that guest experience because we know if we delight our guests in the hotels, they're going to come back and become loyal members of ours. So those are some of the things that we're doing to drive that share.

Your next question comes from Ryan Meliker from Canaccord Genuity.
Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, I guess two things that I wanted to ask you guys about with regards to guidance. First of all, it sounds like your guidance includes the timeshare business being sold off or the spinoff being executed start of the second quarter, but SG&A guidance was only flat to down 2%. I would have expected to see a bigger guidance reduction in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter on SG&A, so surprised to see that.
And then the second thing I had with regards to guidance is, Tom, maybe you can give us some color, but why issue guidance at all with the agreement in place with Marriott? It seems like it was something that we weren't expecting. I thought it was a little odd. Can you give us some color on the thought process that you had? And if there were discussions back and forth with the board on that?
Alan M. Schnaid - Chief Financial Officer
So, Ryan, it's Alan. I'll take the first question and then turn it over to Tom on the second. On the first question, the SG&A for the timeshare business is actually reflected in the timeshare line item and so it's not included in our corporate SG&A. So it's a fairly standalone business with a separate overhead function, and so that's why you're not seeing further reduction in SG&A from post the ILG transaction.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Yes, and just another thought on the SG&A, we had significantly over-delivered our expectations in 2015 on SG&A, so we announced that program in April to take $25 million out. So what you're getting is the full-year effect of those decisions in 2016. But if you look, when we made that plan we had already been out with guidance of 2% to 4% SG&A growth and we've come in substantially below 2015 versus 2014 on SG&A. So we actually think like we've done a good job being a steward of our shareholders' money on SG&A.
Why guidance? Well, first and foremost, we're still an independent company, we're competing in the marketplace and there's still a chance that there is an outside bidder would want to make a bid. So we thought more transparency, maintaining the same level of transparency that we've been giving is important. I think it helps also the investment community and our shareholders understand what's going on in the marketplace, despite a lot of noise out there. So really for those two reasons we've continued to give guidance and we'll do so as long as we're an independent company.

Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color on your unit growth for 2016, both gross and net, and whatever you're including in terms of assumptions about asset sales just to understand how that factors into unit growth? Thanks.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Let me take that one, Robin. Thanks for that. So, first, we were thrilled with our unit growth in 2015. I know your question is on 2016, but just to highlight it, we have brought renewed focus there because we knew it was a gap area for us versus competition. And even at the 4.4% that we delivered in 2015, we still lag some of our big competitors here, so we know that there's more wood to chop, and so we're not letting up.
And really I think some of the ways we've driven that growth and will continue to be focus areas for us are brands like Tribute and Luxury Collection which can drive significant conversions in the space as well as really trying to dramatically expand our luxury footprint. So relative to our goals of footprint growth in the year ahead, we're running the same play and we deployed our development resources around the globe and tasked them with significant goals. We've made capital available to them in the same amount that we've deployed in the past. And frankly despite the external noise of the transaction, are quite pleased with the potential to deliver a similar year to 2015.

Your next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys. Quick question on the asset sales. What type of assets are you looking to sell? Are you targeting cash buyers or the financial buyers? You mentioned the financing market was getting a little tight, so will that impact the demand you're seeing for the assets?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Yes, so I think that was also Robin's question and I forgot to get to that one. So look we're down to 24 properties that we own worldwide. And with the spinoff of Vistana, it takes five of those out of the systems. So we're down to 19. So we're on the short strokes here. And many of those are sitting in Latin America, which is a pretty tough economic environment right now to sell hotels.
So we're looking to continue to market our properties in North America. That includes properties in Canada as well as the ones remaining in Europe. And we only have a complexed operation in Fiji and in Asia. So we're not holding anything back, and we've been running processes on the big value driving assets there, and that's what gives us confidence that we can get the extra $800 million of incremental sales beyond the $200 million of spinout with Vistana to get to $1 billion goal.
And I think that relative to financing market, yes, I think it's tight in North America, and I think the valuations in the REIT space have made it also tough to get REIT buyers in the numbers we had, call it, the first half of 2015. But as you saw with our Imperial deal, the sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies are still out there very actively buying, and we continue to see high interest there. And their motivation is much more of asset diversification. And I think that the worldwide financial gyrations that have been out there have only motivated them more to continue to diversify their portfolios away from energy or away from maybe Asian-based real estate into hotels.

And Tom's number was excluding the eight properties that are operated under operating leases on the top of it, just to be clear.

Your next question comes from David Loeb from Baird.
David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Just along those same lines, not specifically about the financing market, but about the real estate market, the press reports suggest that you have some big chunky assets like the Westin Maui and The St. Regis, New York on the market. Do you think that those kinds of sovereign wealth buyers or high net worth buyers are interested in those? And where do you think values are in those two markets relative to where they were call it a year ago?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
Well, the short answer is I think there is high interest for assets that are one of a kind like The St. Regis, New York, and I think you've seen, including with the recent sale of Imperial, that valuations can be quite strong on those. And as you can imagine, I don't want to comment too much about where valuations are, will be, because we might be working on trying to lock down specific valuation in any of these type of transactions. But by and large, I think if the per key number on the Imperial that's $571,000 a key, we felt it was a very strong valuation. And I think we'll continue to see strong valuations in gateway cities for folks who want to diversify into those market.

Your next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research.
Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Hi. My question is on fees. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the 2015 story? I think you had something close to 4% unit growth and flattish actual dollar RevPAR growth. How do you get fees that are flat? What type of FX headwind did you see in 2015? And then can you help us understand kind of the lay of unit additions and maybe when they start paying fees, so we can think about that for 2016?
Alan M. Schnaid - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Vince. Thanks for the question. I'll take that. We obviously saw significant foreign exchange headwind impacting our fee growth in 2015. Core fees were impacted by approximately $9 million from foreign exchange. So without FX, core fees would have been up closer to 4%. So that had a significant impact on our fees.
As far as ramping up, what we typically see is, the second year following an addition of a hotel is when we see the ramp-up of those hotels in our system. So obviously first full year after we've signed a deal and then we get the full year impact, and then in the second year we get the ramp up of those fees.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Executive Officer
One other thing I'd like to add there, Vince, is I don't know if you were only speaking core fees or total fees, but don't forget in 2014 we had over $40 million of fees running through the fee line and earnings from termination. And that was an area of significance from terminations and hotels we lost and we got paid off for that. So we had quality of earnings issue in 2014, which is what we've addressed this year. We've knocked that down dramatically back to our long-term run rate of about $10 million of fees from term fees. So that was a big headwind on our fee growth, overall fee growth in 2015 and, of course, we're not expecting to get back to level of term fees that we had in 2014 ever again. Any other questions?
