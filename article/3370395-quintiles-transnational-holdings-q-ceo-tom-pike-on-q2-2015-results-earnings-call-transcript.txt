Welcome to Quintiles' Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Janine and I will be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Todd Kasper, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kasper, the floor is yours.
Todd Kasper
Thank you, Janine. Good morning and welcome to Quintiles' second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.Quintiles.com/investors. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.
Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements, due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2014 annual report on form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2015. In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation. I would like to point out that, as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange and therefore we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Tom Pike
Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Now let's begin on slide 3 with some highlights. The second quarter was a very solid quarter that featured quite a number of things. Strong book-to-bills in both our product development and integrated healthcare services or IHS segments, product development and integrated healthcare services' robust revenue growth, particularly in IHS, a stronger quarter in product development overall.
A significant share repurchase, a refinancing of our outstanding debt and the launch of Q2 solutions, our clinical trials laboratory joint venture transaction with Quest Diagnostics. Beginning with the financial performance, the strong new business pipeline entering the year and from the first quarter continued, as we booked $1.32 billion of net new business during the quarter, representing growth of 7.6% and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 times services revenues, adding to our now nearly $11.4 billion industry-leading backlog.
We recorded a trailing 12 month book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 times, demonstrating our continued strength on the back of our world-class sales organization. Our services revenues grew by 9.8% at constant currency, with a strong contribution from the IHS segment.
With the strength of new business wins in recent quarters, we have an increased number of studies and start up and recruiting in product development. The overall adjusted income from operations margin grew to 15.3%, compared to 13.7% in the prior-year quarter, with the growth largely coming from improved constant currency margins in IHS, as well as some foreign exchange benefit across the company. On a consolidated basis, we finished the second quarter with $0.78 of diluted adjusted earnings per share, representing a growth of 20%. It was also a notable quarter in terms of capital deployment.
Based on the strength of our cash flows, we were able to complete a $2.75 billion debt refinancing, allowing us to extend our debt maturities, lowering the average rates we pay for debt outstanding and having increased flexibility as we look to invest in growth for the future. We also repurchased $250 million worth or approximately 3.9 million shares of our common stock, in conjunction with the $769 million underwritten offering by our sponsor shareholders in May which brings our total capital return to shareholders via share repurchase to $665 million since the beginning of 2014. There's still approximately $110 million remaining under our previously approved and announced share repurchase authorization, as well.
On July 1, we closed our previously announced joint venture transaction with Quest Diagnostics, bringing together the clinical trials laboratory operations of the two organizations, thereby launching Q2 Solutions which is 60% owned by Quintiles. Q2 Solutions is the second largest clinical trials laboratory services company in the world and a winning combination for our customers. We will begin consolidating the results of the combined organization in the third quarter. It was a very active second quarter for the company, producing strong results. I'll now turn it over to Kevin to discuss the quarter in more detail.
Kevin Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the consolidated results on slide 4. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, consolidated service revenues grew 9.8% at constant currency, compared to the same prior-year quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 3.8%, to over $1.07 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $62.2 million. The global mix of service revenue shifted towards North America in the quarter, as a result of strength in commercial North America and real-world late-phase research, as well as from the Encore acquisition.
For the quarter, the North America and Latin America region contributed nearly 47% or 490 basis points more than the same period last year. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region contributed nearly 33%, down 460 basis points from the same prior-year period. And the Asia-Pacific region remains steady at 20% plus of total consolidated revenues. 
The product development segment accounted for 73% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 27%, a 220 basis point greater contribution from IHS compared to the second quarter of 2014, due to the stronger revenue growth in this segment, including the addition of Encore.
During the second quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 16%, to $164.6 million, a margin of 15.3%, with 160 basis points of margin expansion. This expansion was comprised of 160 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations across the company, along with increased margins in the IHS segment, offset by a change in product development, service revenue mix and segment revenue that was more heavily weighted towards IHS compared to the same period in 2014.
For the second quarter, SG&A was $225.9 million or 21% of service revenues, compared to $219 million or 21.2% of service revenues, in the prior year. The current-year quarter included increased compensation-related costs, including share-based compensation, along with costs associated with Encore and the formation of Q2 Solutions, offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 27.6% in the quarter, compared to 28.4% for the same period in 2014. Adjusted net income in the second quarter grew 15.1%, to $98.7 million, compared to the same period last year. The current-year quarter GAAP results include pretax expenses of $4.6 million, for an adjustment to estimated contingent consideration related to acquisitions and a $7.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the refinancing.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 20%, to $0.78 per share in the second quarter, compared to $0.65 per share in the prior-year quarter. Receipt of final administrative approval for research and development credits in Europe that we had forecasted to receive later in the year resulted in $0.06 per share benefit to the second quarter diluted adjusted EPS. We recognized $6.2 million of net restructuring charges during the second quarter, in connection with previously approved restructuring plans. We expect to incur additional costs under these plans throughout 2015, as well as costs associated with Q2 Solutions integration.
Our cash balance was $804 million at the end of the quarter, of which $266 million was in the U.S.. Cash used in operations was $13.6 million in the first six months of 2015, including a $50 million positive contribution in the second quarter, compared to a second quarter number of $38.7 million for the same period in 2014.
The increase in cash used during the period reflects an increase in days sales outstanding, DSO. DSO increased nine days in the first six months of 2015, compared to a five-day increase during the same period in 2014. DSO can shift significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of billing and cash receipts under contract payment terms, relative to the recognition of revenue over a project lifecycle.
Capital expenditures were $31.9 million in the first six months of this year or 1.5% of service revenues, compared to $35.8 million during the same period in 2014. Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at June 30, 2015, was $1.69 billion, compared to $1.42 billion at the end of December 2014, increasing due to the lower cash balance and increased borrowings from the refinancing in the quarter. The new business book during the quarter added $305 million more new backlog than revenue burned, net of the foreign exchange impact, resulting in backlog of $11.37 billion.
Let's now move to our two operating segments. Please turn to slide 5. In product development, second quarter net new business continued the trend of strong bookings. We booked net new business totaling $968 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 times service revenues in the quarter. As with the past two quarters, new business in the product development segment included an improved mix of attractive clinical full-service studies and an increase for central lab services. Product development's constant currency revenue growth was 5.5% in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year.
At actual foreign exchange rates, the product development service revenues were $786.4 million, including $37.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, compared to the same prior-year period. Product development's revenue growth was from an increase in clinical solutions and services provided on a functional resourcing basis, clinical trial support services and core clinical services throughout Asia and Japan. Revenues also benefit from $16.9 million of revenue recognized as a result of a release of deferred revenue, upon early closeout of a customer arrangement, at a slight loss in the second quarter.
This growth was offset by the anticipated negative impact of cancellations from 2014. Product development income from operations for the quarter was $176.2 million, an 11.2% increase at actual rates and 5.2% increase at constant currency rates. Product development income from operations margin was 22.4% in the quarter, representing an improvement of 210 basis points compared to the same period last year, including 220 basis points of positive foreign exchange benefits. We also recorded -- excuse me -- a $7.6 million reduction in our cost of service revenues for the foreign research and development credits mentioned earlier.
These increases were offset by a change in service revenue mix compared to the same period in 2014, along with an increase in billable headcount, due to the ramp-up of new projects resulting from net new business wins. In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $354 million, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 times service revenues in the second quarter, with a strong contribution from our real world and late phase business and commercial services in Europe. IHS service revenues grew 22.9% at constant currency rates in the second quarter.
At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $288 million, representing an increase of 13.2% or $33.7 million, compared to the same period last year, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $24.8 million. The increase in service revenues for the quarter in IHS segment was attributable to commercial North America, a continuation of strong growth in our real world and late phase research unit and $24.4 million from the Encore acquisition, offset by lower service revenues in commercial Europe. IHS income from operations for the second quarter was $18.7 million, 60% growth at actual rates and 76.7% at constant currency rates, compared to the same period in 2014.
The income from operations margin for the quarter was 6.5% at actual rates and 6.6% at constant currency. Margins improved 200 basis points at constant currency, from a positive service mix change from higher-margin services.
Now turning to our 2015 full-year guidance update on slide 6. We updated our 2015 constant currency service revenue growth guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.5%, compared to full-year 2014. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the first half of this year, we now expect our full-year service revenues to be impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of over 480 basis points, compared to 2014.
This revenue guidance assumes the addition of approximately $80 million of revenues for the second half of 2015 from the Q2 Solutions business, along with improved growth in product development revenue, as more projects transition from startup to higher revenue-generating activities. It also assumes the previously guided lower second-half revenue growth rates in the IHS, compared to the first half of 2015, due to tougher year-over-year comparables, as well as Encore now eclipsing its one-year anniversary of acquisition.
We raised our expectations for diluted adjusted earnings per share to between $3.09 and $3.19 per share, representing growth of 14.4% to 18.1%. And updated our diluted GAAP earnings per share estimate to between $2.84 and $2.96 per share. Our diluted adjusted EPS guidance assumes a neutral impact from Q2 Solutions transaction, including the add-back of one-time costs. Integration and restructuring actions are expected to cost approximately $17 million to $20 million through 2017 and result in net annualized savings of between $40 million and $50 million in 2018.
We expect the transaction to be accretive to diluted adjusted EPS, beginning in 2016. As a result of the refinancing, we expect net interest expense of approximately $100 million for the full year and continue to expect the full-year effective income tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. This guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates at the end of June for the balance of the year, but does not reflect the potential impact of future equity repurchases. I will now turn it back to Tom.
Tom Pike
Thanks, Kevin. This is our ninth quarterly earnings call since returning to the public markets in May of 2013. We appreciate those investors who are willing to invest in us and glad that we could demonstrate shareholder return over this period. In advance of the call, I looked back at some of the themes we had for investors from a September 2013 presentation.
We said a new period of growth for biopharmaceutical services, deep customer relationships and competitive advantages, leaders in innovation and technology in our segment, global leadership in product development, growing opportunities in integrated healthcare services and operational excellence and management depth.
I think we had it right. At Quintiles, we strive to have strong strategies and execute against them, providing customer benefit and shareholder return. We've done that and let me make some comments in line with these themes that we've been driving for the past couple of years. It's been a strong period of growth for biopharmaceutical services and we execute against an exciting backdrop. More than 4,800 drugs are in the phase 1 to 3 pipeline, up sequentially from the first quarter. Biotech funding is still at record levels on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Biotechs are becoming a bigger part of the R&D ecosystem for larger pharmaceutical firms.
Tremendous developments in science that allow us to reliably cure patients with hepatitis C, treat cystic fibrosis, including the recent approval of Orkambi, treat HIV as a chronic illness, as well as the early promise in therapies that may have disease-modifying effects on Alzheimer's. We have new scientific platforms that utilize engineered chimeric antigen receptor T cells that have exciting results in patients with cancer and the list goes on. RNA therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, new monoclonal antibodies. There's a race to bring down costs, as well, through biosimilars and use of precision medicine.
This situation has resulted in strong demand for services like ours, biopharmaceutical services and for both of our segments. The opportunity pipeline for clinical services remains strong. We're the leaders in providing one-stop shopping across the clinical and lab services and sole-source arrangements. Our deep and broad customer relationships put us in a different position.
We do not have a customer that's more than 10% of revenue and 14 of our 550 plus customers do over $100 million of business with us. At the same time, we introduced offerings to better support smaller biotech in both the West and in Asia and have shown real results for both customers and our new business in those segments.
Given this backdrop and the strong net new business, we're seeing more studies in our backlog that are now in startup and recruiting. We have some real competitive advantages here at Quintiles. We believe we're the leaders in technology, with the introduction of our mobile tool for study management, our risk-based monitoring and predictive analytics. We were named to the InformationWeek Elite 100 this quarter, as well. We're the leaders in people and process, with our global delivery network which allows us to price competitively with the industry but maintain our leading margins.
And of course, our medical and scientific expertise separates us from competition, allowing us to keep pace with changing science and regulatory demands. The combination of these competitive advantages allows us to lead what the industry refers to as risk-based monitoring which for us is monitoring based on statistics, a real strength, with over 800 bio-statisticians and statistical programmers. These are capabilities that allow us to work in partnerships or in sole-source.
In the category of innovation, let me touch on Q2 Solutions, our transaction with Quest. Given that we're now out of the gate, let me share a few thoughts on that business. The clinical laboratory business is a growing business. By our estimate, that market is growing about 4% to 5%, but it is a very different business than the typical CRO. People costs dominate the CRO in much of Quintiles' business. However, in the lab, equipment facilities can be expensive and are growing more so. Utilization is critical; so is scale.
We're also seeing the interplay between laboratory assays and clinical research evolving which is being accelerated by the increasing reliance on biomarkers in clinical development programs. Biomarkers are complemented by companion diagnostics to stratify patients and target new treatments for patients who are likely to have the greatest risk-benefit or for post hoc hypothesis generation to create greater clarity for disease response profiles. This necessitates greater clinical and scientific expertise in both the laboratories, as well as the clinical studies that CROs perform.
Essentially, a companion diagnostic allows a therapeutic treatment to safely and prospectively target or dose a well-defined subpopulation. It is a critical part of precision or personalized medicine, as well as efficient and effective drug development. According to a recent study from Tufts, biopharmaceutical firms expect that there will be a 69% increase in the number of personalized medicines and development in the next five years.
Furthermore, companies involved in personalized medicine report that across all phases of development, 73% of oncology compounds now rely on biomarker data and 42% of all compounds rely on biomarker data. These and other considerations make the clinical laboratory a business where scale is important and ability to incorporate scientific expertise in a post-approval platform delivering the assays is critical. Quest is the largest laboratory diagnostics provider, but had a smaller clinical laboratory business.
We were and remain the second largest provider of clinical lab services. Quest brings skills around software equipment interfaces, scale lab software, procurement, lean processes, storage, quality processes and more. Quintiles brings customer relationships, clinical knowledge, deep project management skills.
Both organizations have deep medical skills. And between us, we have over 2,600 medical doctors and PhD's. Our structure allows us to service not only Quintiles and Quest, but the industry. As Kevin described, in addition to being able to make significant investments for customers and serve them better, there are financial benefits, including the $40 million to $50 million of annual run rate savings we expect out in 2018. The integration is well-planned and straightforward and within each company's experience set.
We also continue to look for ways to partner around other information, as both companies are leaders in these areas. We're impressed with Quest's evolving management systems and very impressed with their team. Back to Quintiles overall, let me speak quickly to management depth and excellence. I'm convinced we have the best management in the industry. We balance customer, employee and stakeholder concerns, knowing that adding value to customers, increasing their probability of success, as we say, along with profound interest in helping patients, makes us tick.
This strength is evidenced by some of the awards we received this quarter, including the preferred provider for phase 2-3 research by ISR reports and the 30 most meaningful companies to work for in America by Business Insider. Importantly, it's also evidenced by our capital strategies, our share buyback, lowering the cost of our debt, extending the maturities, demonstrating that we will continue to drive value for our shareholders and stay a leader into the future. We're Fortune 500 Company and will be a leader for a long time to come.
In closing, I'd like to thank the entire Quintiles team, including that management team, who this quarter continued to get both the big and the small things right. Todd, back to you for questions.
Todd Kasper
Thank you, Tom. We're now ready to take questions. I would like to ask our participants to please limit their questions to one, to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions. Janine, you may now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Michael Baker
Kevin, I was wondering if we could get some additional color around the margin impact in product development, from the service revenue mix change, as well as the ramp in headcount? And on the ramp in headcount, can you give us a sense as to where you are, relative to the balance of the year there?
Kevin Gordon
We've made very good progress in getting ourselves set up for the trials that we will be running in the second half of the year. We're in that startup phase. We did mention, earlier this year, about the number of trials coming in as a result of the net new business and I think you heard Tom mention that that trend has continued and you saw the strength of the new business.
So as we plan our headcount resourcing to fill out those trials, as well as continue to build out our GDN, our global delivery network, we've added appropriately in that area. So I expect, as we go into the second half of the year, there's not any significant impact, with respect to margins and product development in particular.
You see that our margins here in Q2 came back very comparable, at a constant currency basis, with where we were at this time last year. So I think we've made good progress. We expect the margins to continue to be in this area, as we go through the rest of the year and as we ramp up.
Operator
And the next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.
John Kreger
Tom, can you give us an update on the therapeutic mix of your backlog across product development? And perhaps how that's changed since a year ago?
Tom Pike
I think the main thing is, we continue to see strength in oncology. We see a strength in the pipeline in oncology. So we have rough numbers that are in the 30%s, mid-30%s, in terms of what we see in the pipeline. And we continue to really deliver against that and so that would be the strongest.
We also do see, especially with some of the areas like Alzheimer's, we see strength in CNS, but I think it's interesting, John, we continue probably to have the widest expanse. Given our 14 therapeutic areas, we probably have the widest expanse of types of trials going on in the industry. For instance, in the GI area, we're really strong and consistently win. So it's pretty broad, but we do lead in oncology, much like a lot of the exciting therapies you're seeing.
Operator
And the next questioner is Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Dave Windley
Tom, my sense is that the pace of approvals by regulators, predominantly in the U.S., I guess, but probably around the world and also the complexity and novelty of these new drugs being approved, creates really interesting opportunities for, really, multiple pieces of your IHS business and perhaps that might be, over the next 3 to 5 years, one of your faster-growing opportunities. And I wondered if you could perhaps comment on whether you agree with that or not? And some of the opportunities that maybe you see materializing for IHS and particularly the higher-margin pieces of IHS?
Tom Pike
We agree. It's actually interesting, when you look back in 2004, there were about 5 orphan drugs; there were 17 in 2015 approved. And if you look at things -- areas like personalized medicine, probably 9 of the 41 novel drugs were really considered personalized medicine. So it's -- there is a real sea change in what's going on. We think there's a couple of aspects that influences things.
You are seeing a little bit of change associated with the complexities of trials, given the types of things that are in the pipeline. But also, as you say, on the IHS front, particularly in North America, we do see a very strong potential for both the commercial services because what you're seeing is, you're seeing some companies that are introducing quite a number of drugs over the next couple of years and they don't want to add to their sales force in the traditional ways.
And then at the same time, you're also seeing a real need for real world, late phase type services which is also in our IHS entity because what you see is, when you get a drug approved on a small population, you need to continue to monitor it into the real world, to make sure that it continues to be safe.
And you understand the drug better from a regulatory and even from a commercialization, standpoint. So that's why who you continue to see real world, late phase is our fastest-growing entity. So I think you're right, I think the nature of things is good. We've seen a few less drugs approved in the first half of the year than last year. However, in general, it feels like we're on a similar pace.
And certainly, if you look at the interest in our customers' pipelines, the interest remains very high in what the opportunity is, associated with the drugs in their pipeline.
Operator
Thank you. The next questioner is Garen Sarafian with Citi. Please go ahead.
Garen Sarafian
I guess my one question now is, on the revenue guidance number, if you back out the contribution from Q2, is our math correct? That it is slightly below where you were intending for the year? And is that due to maybe prolonged trial starts due to the complexity of the trials now than previously anticipated?
Kevin Gordon
Actually, a very good question. And I think your math is correct. It is slightly less than we guided. I will tell you that it's not necessarily related to the items that you mentioned. We still see continued strength in the trial startups. We expect them to happen. A little bit of the shortfall that you see there is really related to a couple of the other service lines that we have.
For instance, we have a regulatory and quality advisory group that is really dependent upon contracts that need to come in and come in really with great volatility. And we had expected a couple there in the second half of the year that haven't really materialized, so that's having the impact on our view.
You did hear me mention the strength in our functional resourcing business, the contribution that it's made to revenues in the first half of the year. And a couple of those projects, on that basis, actually are running at a bit lower level than we expected them to be, going into the second half.
So from a mix perspective, we actually have a positive second-half contribution to the revenue, in that our expectations around our core business remain very consistent with where we guided, but there is a couple of ancillary lines that are coming in a bit lower than expected.
Tom Pike
It might be worth noting that our trailing 12 months book to bill in product development now is 1.48 times. So I think we feel pretty good about it. And Kevin delineated that well, in terms of the core clinical business, we remain very strong.
Operator
And the next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Julia Murphy
This is Julia Murphy in for Ricky. Just a quick question. Last quarter, you guys talked about slower clinical trial ramp-up periods. You've alluded to it a few times already on the call. Can you just update us on what you're seeing with that and any changes in that trend?
Kevin Gordon
I would say our message is exactly consistent with what we've said the last couple of quarters. The question earlier around backlog composition, oncology, the complexity related to those trials. The amount of demand that we have in that area, I think, is contributing to that. I think the good news for us is, we actually saw a slight uptick in our revenue -- or our backlog burn rate in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.
And we expect that to improve a bit, as we go into the second half. But I wouldn't say that the total dynamic has shifted. The real underlying theme of startup, award to start up and protocol complexity, the number of trials, etcetera, has had an impact on that overall lifecycle. But it was nice to see a bit of an improvement here in the second quarter, compared to the first.
Operator
And the next question will be from Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please proceed.
Douglas Tsao
Just Kevin, maybe a little bit along those lines, relative to my model, product development seemed to perform better than I was expecting. Just when we think about the rest of the year, should we think that perhaps some of that improved a little bit? And that the rest of the year will be a little bit more linear in direction, rather than a little bit more of the logarithmic trend, in terms of the revenue build back up?
Kevin Gordon
Yes, I think as a result of what you saw in the second quarter, there's often this reference to hockey sticks and slope of hockey sticks. And I think our hockey stick probably flattened out a little bit, compared to where we were before.
But it's important, Doug, to understand that part of that was that one contract that we specifically called out, that resulted in $17 million of revenue recognition in the second quarter. That actually resulted in a higher revenue. So I wouldn't say our hockey stick is necessarily flattening out too much from a performance expectation, other than what I mentioned earlier. It's more so that there was a bit more revenue that came in in Q2.
Tom Pike
Doug, we had a specific goal to actually try to pull forward a little revenue, to make it a little smoother, just from the standpoint of being able to staff things effectively. So we did try to do some things that would make, of course, that makes sense for the business to be able to staff effectively and so you saw some of that come through.
Operator
And the next question is from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Donald Hooker
So my question was, I was very interested in the new predictive functionalities you guys press released back, I guess, in June, around risk-based monitoring. And if there are any anecdotes that you can provide as to how this affects the economics of your business? So we can think about how -- looking ahead, how some of these new tools could presumably drive margin expansion over time. Can you provide some anecdotes there?
Tom Pike
Yes. It's a great question, actually. Interestingly, if you think about the way the business works and today, what happens is, monitors visit investigators. And that's one of the more challenging parts of our business. Those people, the monitors, are in very high demand. You hear our competitors talk about it. It's the place where there's a true war on talent. And so associated with that, frankly the margins on those monitors are not always where you want them to be.
On the other hand, when you're able to do more centralized monitoring, you're able to manage the costs a little bit more effectively. And so if you think about it, I sometimes liken our industry evolving to airlines or railways. Or if you think about it, it's a big logistics business, in many ways, making sure that all this data, this evidence, is collected well, monitored well, effective. And so the more that we can put into a more centralized entity, the better the margin will be on those people, in terms of margin percentage.
So you're onto something very important that we see as a trend over time, that we're trying to take a little of the burden off that highly competitive workforce that we have, with the monitors going out to sites. And trying to put a little more burden centrally where you can manage the costs more effectively.
Operator
And the next questioner is Steven Valiquette from UBS. Please go ahead.
Steven Valiquette
My question, just a pretty simple one here. Within the JV, if I'm doing my math right, I think the revenue contribution split is roughly 75/25, even though the ownership split is 60/40. So I'm just curious if we can maybe, let's say, deduce from that that the margins on your revenue contribution might be a little bit higher than what's coming from the Quest side? Thanks.

I think the way we think about it is that Quest really brings very significant operational and system skills and things. And we thought that the contributions, if you looked at the balance of the contributions, many of them are beyond financial, in terms of management skills, expertise, locations, that we thought the 60/40 was right for a long-term sustainable partnership.
Interesting, what it does is, it makes the entity important to both companies. As you probably can tell, in many ways, this joint venture, Q2 Solutions, needs to be successful on its own, but we do think it needs to rely on the parents.
We have tremendous sales capability, tremendous customer relationships and we want to make sure -- and scientific medical expertise. We want to make sure that comes from Quintiles. But we also want it to be important enough for Quest, as a contribution, because they bring many similar skills and tremendous operational procurement and logistics expertise. So these things are always balanced, but we thought that 60/40 was a very fair split. It's a good question, though.

And our next questioner will be Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Tycho Peterson
Actually I had a follow-up on the guidance questions earlier. Just given that Q2 is neutral to EPS and assuming the R&D credit with already factored in as a 4Q event. Can you maybe just talk about the dynamics behind the EPS raise?
Kevin Gordon
Yes, Tycho, you got it right. Somewhat neutral on the refinancing, neutral on the lab JV coming through the year, as we execute the integration plans. You saw a couple cents of upside from the second quarter, in our view, from where we were before. But we also got a benefit from the repurchase that we exercised in May.
That share repurchase added to the second half. So it's a bit of performance in Q2, in line with our original expectations or slightly better in the second half, from where we were before. And then a benefit from the share repurchase program is certainly what delivered the bottom line beat and then the revenue I think we addressed earlier.
Tycho Peterson
Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Tom. Given the variability we're saying in general within the industry around backlog conversion, is book-to-bill still the best leading indicator of the business?
Tom Pike
I think it still is. We've been looking at that backlog conversion, as well, as you can imagine. And I think the things that we describe, 157% increase in procedures, different regulatory time frames, things that are described by the industry are true. But you still -- if you're looking for who's gaining share and who's really winning these key opportunities, I think you really see that through book-to -bill. And that's very important. You also see the general health of the industry associated with it.
We're going to continue -- based on our guidance, we're continuing to look at that conversion ratio, continuing to look at levers that we have, from our standpoint. Either working with our customers or on our own, to continue to improve that. The funny thing is that it's actually in both our customers' benefit and in our benefit, to generally try to improve that because what it means is, patients are being recruited faster. So working together with our customers, I think we'll continue to work on ways to improve that conversion ratio.

And next is Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Ross Muken
I just want to touch back on the Quest JV. JVs in general are always tricky and obviously, getting off to a good start is always key. So if you think about the interaction and how the organizations have come together and how you've liaised with the senior folks over at Quest, can you give us a sense for how that's gone?
And then, now that you've introduced the pro forma entity, what's the type of feedback you're getting from customers? Where do you get the most interest? Where is that discussion? I know you talked about some of the personalized medicine capabilities, but I'm assuming there's probably a broader sort of interest level there. Thanks.
Tom Pike
Yes, those are great questions, because you're right, I think in an entity like this, how the parents interact and then how the leadership team interacts, is very important to the success. And then I'll talk to the customers briefly. The management teams actually get along great. It's interesting, Kevin gets along well with Mark Guinan. I do with Steve, the CEO. And so the management teams really get along great.
Quest has done some very impressive things with their management process that I think we're going to learn from. And then I think we're doing some things around how we deal with customers that will be beneficial for Quest. Just to give you a sense of the strength, I had the lead from the Quest side come and speak with our executive committee last week.
He joined us for dinner, spent a couple of hours talking about the Quest management systems. And it's created a lot of discussion among my executive team about, we're always interested in continuous improvement, about how we can continue to improve. So that's very strong. The customer response has been great, actually. I spoke to a senior person last week and even personally, have been in a number of discussions with some of the CEOs of our customers and everyone gets it. Everyone wants competition in the labs.
I think there is this strong belief that what I tried to describe, associated with the sophistication and complexity around biomarkers and assays, that that is going to continue to be a key part of clinical development. And that you do need scale leaders with deep scientific expertise to be able to drive that. And so the general response we've had has been very strong. And then some people comment on the relative complexity of integrating two lab businesses, versus the relative complexity of integrating two companies.
The lab businesses, it's pretty straightforward. As we said, it's within our skill set, on both sides, to be able to do that. And so we view this integration as being pretty straightforward, leveraging a lot of the Quest and Quintiles expertise. So the response has been very strong so far.
In fact, I'm not sure if we mentioned it specifically, Kevin. We had an extremely strong quarter in net new business for the lab in quarter two, at the same time that the JV announcement was out there. So we felt like the facts support the general sense that we get from the customers.
Kevin Gordon
Ross, I'll add to Tom's comments about the structure of the JV. Tom is absolutely right. I think the focus that the JV has received from the top of our organization, the top of Quest organization, has been very, very good. I think as important or even more important is, we built a management team that has a strong leader that has integration of talent and functions from both organizations that are excited to be part of the JV. They see the opportunity that they have in front of them.
And we put that appropriate leadership structure in place. We put a governing structure in place, to get out of the gate which includes a Board that has cross-functional capabilities or experiences.
We've already had our first Board meeting. We're obviously focused on the integration plans and getting them going. So you can rest assured that I think we're putting all the right governance structures in place, we're focused on the integration and we have a management team, I think, that's quite charged up about the opportunity that's in front of them.
Operator
And the next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Jones
I guess, Tom, just going back to the JV. Given this is a new type of arrangement, can you maybe just share exactly what is driving the $80 million in revenue that we're seeing? And I'm sorry if I missed this, but I'm just curious how much of that stays within your P&L? Or should we be backing out future revenue in minority interest? And then just along those lines, any sense you can give us on source and timing of synergies between now and 2018?
Tom Pike
I'll touch briefly on where the revenue comes from. And then Kevin can talk a little bit about the specifics of how it's going to roll into the financials. It's not unlike our mix, but smaller, to be perfectly honest with you. They have several large customers and they have a bunch of small customers.
And the mix is not dissimilar, in terms of, we tend to call it in the industry, safety testing which is the more traditional testing. And then esoteric testing which is really more sophisticated. Technically, it's defined as more rare things to be tested. And so it's not dissimilar; it's just smaller.
The interesting thing is, though, we're really focused on the biopharmaceutical industry with our customer teams and we have that access that allows us to know when our fees are coming, to actually create some level of demand for our services and I think that's where we will really bring benefit.
Quest is very strong on safety. You think about the importance, in their diagnostic business, of making sure those tests are right. We all have the same thing, but they do it safety at scale. And so bringing those two pieces together just makes a lot of sense. But it's pretty consistent with ours, but smaller. They have a little bit less access to the pharmaceutical business. Kevin, do you want to talk how this rolls in?
Kevin Gordon
And that access is one of the real key things that makes this an opportunity to leverage on their capabilities and bringing it into the pharmaceutical space at a much larger opportunity, with respect to our customer relationships. With respect to the revenue, Bob, the $80 million, although it's a joint venture, we actually treat this as if it was an acquisition.
We're a 60% owner in the JV. So as part of the transaction, the underlying estimate of the second half revenues is the revenues that were normally forecasted for the operations of the Quest business that they already had in their backlog that gets consolidated into our revenues. 
We will consolidate the entire entity of Quest and that's where we will pick up all the revenues. It will come into our operating income line. And then, as you suggested on the minority interest piece, what will come out down below the line is their share of the profits. So the entirety of the revenues will remain in our P&L and only their portion of the profits will drop out below the line.
Operator
And our next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Derik de Bruin
You had 160 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter which is really impressive. Can you parse out core versus -- core gains versus FX? How should we think about the balance of the year? And at what point do we -- at what point does the dollar need to be where we need to start worrying about compression?
Kevin Gordon
Sure. I think we tried to do that and I'll do it for you again. I think if you look at product development, we had 220 basis points of benefit from foreign currency on our overall margins and our margins improved 210 basis points. So I think that was the big element there.
And that's why I commented earlier Derik that our actual constant currency margins were relatively in line with exactly where they were last year in our product development. Which, coming off some of the items we talked about impacting the first half, I think that was good progress.
On the IHS side, we had about 10 basis points of currency impact that actually went against us. And then overall, as a company, the net, given that we also have corporate costs [Technical Difficulty] segment calculations, it nets out to 160 basis points of positive benefit from foreign currency.
So I think all in all, we saw progress in product development which got us to similar margins to last year. And in spite of some of the headcount things that we mentioned earlier, we saw a 200 basis point constant currency improvement in our IHS margins. Which is very much where we said we thought we would be, coming through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year.
And then, we're looking at the second half here. And naturally, we can't predict where currency goes from here. But we've guided, in our guidance has us at margins very similar to what we experienced here in the second quarter, through the rest of the year. And that's obviously conditioned or assuming currency rates that exist at the end of June.

And the next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Stephen Hagan
It's Stephen Hagan on for George. Our question was on, if you could provide more detail on the mix of the new business coming in? And the pricing in the industry and how we should think of the margin for this new business that you have in the pipeline? Thanks.
Tom Pike
In general, much like the first quarter, we saw strength associated with the emerging and mid-sized. Now, mid-sized is an interesting category here, because you almost have giant and large now. So mid-size are some pretty big companies, pretty important companies. But for us, you did see a little bit of movement toward the mid-sized. And then again, a very strong emerging in smaller-type portfolios.
So there is no question that some of the -- you look at some of the numbers associated with biotechnology and the investment coming into biotechnology, the way the large companies are thinking about it, in terms of their R&D pipeline and actually thinking about partnerships and acquisitions as key to their R&D pipeline.
We're seeing that in our numbers. The margins in general on that work are consistent. It's interesting, since we went public, we've really been talking a little bit about, is pricing rational?
And pricing has remained pretty consistent and rational, from our standpoint, all the way through. So not a lot better, not worse, but consistent with what we've seen over the past number of quarters. So I would also say, strong pipeline out there. It remains strong. It's very consistent with these record levels that we've seen. And so -- and with a slight mix change toward the smaller.
Operator
And the next questioner is Sandy Draper with SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.
Sandy Draper
My question is one around technology. I generally view you guys as one of the more advanced technology-implementing CROs. There are other CROs that are certainly looking more at using technology to make trials faster or recruit faster. Is there a line at which you think about, okay, we're a service company, we're willing to do some technology. But here's the line at which we're going to let other people, outside of what we do, who are pure technology companies, develop that software. We'll license it. Just trying to understand, if you think about, where does technology start and end for what's internal to Quintiles versus what's out there in the open market?
Tom Pike
You could be in our strategy sessions talking about that implied in your question is that software in our industry is starting to evolve through third parties, like the Metadatas, the Oracles and actually even some startups who are doing some interesting things.
We do work with all of those providers. So we partner with them, regularly talk to them. Because our general strategy is not to replicate transaction systems or to create systems that are maturing. But our strategy is to do things that really create value for our customers that leverage our deep skills, our innovation.
So the kinds of things that we're doing and that we announced recently, like using mobile technology to be able to manage studies, we just think that's a crucial piece. We manage a lot of those studies out of our Infosario tool. Think about that as a data lake or a data warehouse, for understanding what's going on in the studies and now being able to access that in a much more convenient way.
In terms of RBM, there are some basic tools out there. But given our deep statistical orientation, we think that we can create exception-oriented parameters that are the best in the industry, using our expertise. What we don't want to do is really replicate the base technology that's used, the CTMS technology, the EDC technology, these types of things. Where we want to focus is where there's the most value. I've also seen some stuff around site and patient networks. I think we're leaders in that, as well.
Not only using social networking tools, like LinkedIn, to help link physicians together who are doing trials of similar types and allowing them to converse. But also using more specialized tools that actually lets you parse electronic health records or frankly, working with our new partner Quest, in terms of looking at the information that they have, in terms of, how can you find patients with rare diseases, etcetera? So what you tend to find us using that deep analytical and scientific medical expertise to try to develop applications that are in the lead. And then when they mature, we would be happy to hand them off to someone else or to use somebody else's technology.

The last question is queue is Sean Wieland from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Sean Wieland
What do you think of the Cures Act? And what does that do for your business? And are you doing anything to get ready for that?
Tom Pike
I have to say, that is not something that we chatted about much as a management team yet. So in terms of that, I don't think it's very unusual for me to say this, but I don't think that we can go too deep. The thing that I will say is that we're very involved in the -- actually, I may have misheard you. You're talking about the 21st Century Cures? Is that what you?
Sean Wieland
Yes, the Cures Act, the 21st Century Cures Act. Sorry.
Tom Pike
Good. No, I think you may know that we're intimately involved in that. And that basically, our Leader of Clinical Development, Paula Brown Stafford, has testified in front of Congress. We're the only CRO to do that. Our Chief Medical Officer has actually helped guide what's in the legislation. So we're intimately involved in that and we think it's good for the industry. I apologize. I misunderstood you, maybe it was the speakerphone or something.
I thought you caught me with one of those questions that I hadn't heard before. But frankly, I think all of that. To us, we really sit on the same side as the pharmaceutical firms and what's good for the industry is good for us. If there are certain things that cost less to do, then I know those R&D dollars will be reallocated to the exciting compounds in the pipeline and we'll just get more work out of them, but we're the clear leaders. And you can talk to Todd and Kevin, they can give you a little bit more detail on that in the follow-up. So I apologize for missing your question.
Operator
