Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing bye. Welcome to the Q4 2014 IHS Inc Earnings Conference Call. My name is Marie, and Iâll be your Operator today [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
But now, I would now like to hand the call over to Eric Boyer, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Eric Boyer
Good morning. And thank you for joining us for the IHS fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. We issued our fourth quarter earnings release earlier this morning. If you do not have a copy of this release it is available on our website at IHS.com.
Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items.
Our earnings release includes both, our GAAP-based income statement and statement of cash flows and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules are included in our release and can also be found on our website.
The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS is prohibited.
Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from the expectations can be found in IHS's filings with the SEC and on the IHS website.
After our prepared remarks, Scott Key, IHS President and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Key. Scott?
Scott Key
Thank you, Eric. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Itâs a pleasure to be with you this morning to share the results from the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2014. We are pleased with our fourth quarter performance and the strong finish to our year. The result was a solid finish for 2014 that was in line with our expectations for organic growth, revenue, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share.
Based on the efforts of every IHS colleague and leader we accomplished so much this past year. This included the continued roll out of great new platforms that integrate our capabilities and create powerful new solutions for customers, progress with our Target 1000 sales strategy, which focuses sales resources and high growth, high opportunity accounts, the successful integration of R.L. Polk. The closing of small strategically important acquisitions that enhance and extend our information and capabilities within our maritime and trade, technology, chemicals, and energy industry markets.
A successful senior notes offering, refinancing of our credit facility and deleveraging of our balance sheet, record scores again for customer delight and colleague engagement. And once again, the inclusion of IHS to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index supported by more than 21,500 hours of volunteer time given by IHS colleagues in service to our communities around the globe. Many thanks to my colleagues for all their hardwork, a clear focus on a strong close to the year and solid performance.
Todd will provide you with the specifics of our financial performance for the quarter and the year, but I wanted to make a few comments as we get started. We had revenues of $582 million in Q4 up 4% from 2013 and up 4% on an organic basis. We delivered solid subscription organic growth of 6% with improving underlying growth trends.
Adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% expanded 170 basis year-over-year inline with the expectations we set for the quarter and benefitting from acquired asset synergies and our common global infrastructure and we continue to deliver solid free cash flows. In terms of our regional performance in the Americas, we delivered strong organics subscription revenue growth in part driven by solid organic growth trends in our industrial offerings.
In EMEA, we are pleased with organic growth that came in as expected. EMEA continues to benefit from the completion of the alignment of sales teams, leaders and systems to our core industry verticals and the compounding nature of our offerings as customers navigate some large economic and market uncertainty. And finally in APAC, performance continued to improve as expected based on strength in both, subscription and improving non-subscription organic growth.
Let's shift now to our core industries and the horizontal platforms that are driving our commercial expansion initiatives. Resources, which include our energy and chemicals teams experienced stable subscription growth across the portfolio. I will talk about our energy offerings and outlook in more depth in a few moments.
Across our industrials teams, which include automotive, technology, maritime and trade and aerospace and defense, we are see improving trends reflected by strong organic growth of 7%. Our Q4 industrials organic performance was broad based across the industries led autos and maritime and trade product offerings as we benefitted from both new products and synergy revenue realized from the 2013 R.L. Polk acquisition. Our horizontal products had improving organic growth led by stronger subscription performance.
Moving onto acquisitions. In Q4, we completed acquisitions of DisplaySearch and PacWest Consulting Partners. Year-to-date in FY 2015 we also closed the acquisitions of JOC Group and Infonetics Research. Each of our recent acquisitions are strategically important conditions to our core capabilities and subscription offerings, but individually are not financially significant.
Let me spend a moment on each. JOC Group provides detailed ship level U.S. import, export trade details which will help the continued build out of our maritime and trade offerings. PacWest Consulting Partners is our leading provider of market intelligence to the unconventional upstream oil and gas industry.
DisplaySearch is the market leader in primary research for display technology and will broaden our existing Asia-based capabilities in this strategically important area within our technology offerings. Infonetics Research provides market research on a telecom industry and will broaden our technology research capabilities.
We have acquired over 60 companies since the time of our IPO and have successfully integrated those assets into IHS. We have exited very little over the years, their talk about the possibility over exiting sub scale non-core assets when the timing was conducive to both our clients and IHS. In 2015, we plan to exit two small non-core assets and expect any dilutive impact to be offset by recent tuck-in acquisitions. These actions are included in our full year 2015 guidance.
As we have outlined for you every IHS leader and colleague has two clear priorities linked to our performance, operational excellence and commercial expansion. Operational excellence is our relentless focus on continuous improvement in internal systems and processes to make us more efficient everyday and allow us to capture new growth and expand margins as we fully leverage our global infrastructure. We continue to make measurable progress as evidenced by our strong margin expansion in the quarter. We expect to deliver solid margin expansion in 2015 and beyond as we streamline the business, gain synergies from our global infrastructure and benefit from the leverage of our business model.
Turning to our commercial expansion initiatives, which include our workflow platform and account growth initiatives, we made good progress in the period, reflected by improving subscription organic growth in Q4 and as we enter 2015. Our workflow platform development and rollout allows us to become further embedded in our customers' key decision processes and daily workflows in our core industries.
Beyond giving customers a common point of access to integrated IHS solutions, they also simplify the selling motion and enable our substantial cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. In addition, these platform rollouts support our account growth in high opportunity accounts and geo markets and our Target 1000 accounts, field sales and inside sales expansion.
We look forward to a series of important new platform and product releases in 2015 as we execute to our workflow platform strategy. Weâve also made good progress in the period on each of our account growth initiatives, where Target 1000 subscription pipelines for existing customers and potential new customers increased by double digits through 2014.
Given the recent oil price movement and the related uncertainty and volatility within the E&P industry, I thought it might be useful to give a quick overview of our energy offering and the challenges and opportunities given the current energy market environment.
At this point, our energy experts expect oil prices for WTI to average $59 a barrel in 2015 with prices likely bottoming in the early part of the spring. This will lead to continued market volatility and uncertainty for atleast the first part of the year. I want to outline how we have identified and integrated energy market dynamics into our planning, which we have incorporated fully into our 2015 guidance.
As we have strategically scaled each of our industry offerings, our energy offerings are now approximately 40% of our total revenue. These are comprised of 80% subscription and 20% non-subscription revenues. Our information solutions are a critical part of our customers every day business processes across their value chains, starting from high level strategy to help customers figure out where and how they should deploy their capital to everyday processes from exploration to production and downstream activities. IHS products and solutions are a critical part of our customerâs workflows.
We think of our energy offerings in three areas; content, expertise and software. The energy content piece is by far the largest and is the core of our energy offerings. Subscriptions are companywide or you can consume with pricing based on the scale of the customer measured mostly by barrel or equivalent oil reserves. It is important to note customers typically have one energy content subscription which includes the information they use for both their exploration and production activities. So even if a customer does cut back on exploration and as a result uses less of our content for exploration activities they will still need the same subscription for their production activities.
Our revenue is concentrated in very large integrated oil and gas companies that are managing large and long lived production assets and as a result are more resilient in the smaller companies during times of volatility. In the United States 60% of energy content is derived â energy content revenue is derived from our top 120 customers with the remaining revenue from over 2600 small independents.
During our last major oil place decline, we experienced pressure more in the smaller U.S. independents than in our large customers. We are less reliant on our smaller U.S. independent customer segment today as there are 2000 fewer of these companies since 2008. Internationally, 97% of our energy revenue comes from our top 150 accounts with many of these having multiyear agreements.
These dynamics are part of the reason why the content piece of our business has proven so resilient through many oil price cycles. The next largest piece of our energy offerings is expertise, which becomes even more important during times of volatility and uncertainty. Expertise includes our market forecast, insight analysis and events such as IHS CERAWeek. We have recorded attendance at the highest levels at IHS CERAWeek over the last three years, and we would expect continuous strength this year as participants try to make sense of what the recent energy market changes will mean for their own respective interest and the industry as a whole.
Dynamic markets are typically favourable for expertise offerings as customers rely on IHS to understand market impacts and options. There is no better example today than the work we are seeing as a result of the Mexican Energy market reforms. We also just signed a consulting engagement in India which is the largest consulting project in our history.
Given the current energy market dynamics we expect increased industry M&A activity. Our expertise offerings provide valuable insight by providing detailed company and asset transaction research and analysis through our legacy herald offerings and new analytical tools. These capabilities are core to customers' decisions processes in times of volatility and uncertainty. The smallest of the three pieces of our energy offerings is software, our various software offerings are used for exploration and production activities. We do anticipate weakness within our exploration software offerings as companies scale back their CapEx spend and exploration activity.
We expect our software that supports production productivity to potentially benefit from the current environment as companies become more focussed on operational efficiencies. Our 2015 guidance incorporates our expectations for our energy business to experience stable, but slightly lower subscription organic growth and pressure on our non-subscription business.
This view reflects what we have seen so far in our heavy renewal period which spans Q4 and Q1. The must have nature of our information, the relatively small amount of CapEx that a customer spend with us versus the value we provide and the important 2015 new product releases. 2015 growth drivers in energy include new products such as our North American performance evaluator and Vantage, which we believe are both especially relevant in todayâs energy market environment as energy companies and investors increasingly evaluate the performance of energy assets for operational and strategic decision making.
We also expect to drive continued penetration in very large and underserved geo markets in energy such as the Middle East China and India. While lower oil prices will create a challenge for the energy industry in the near term, these dynamics will create positive operating environments and new growth potential for our other large end markets that now comprise approximately 60% of our revenue and includes autos, aerospace and defense, maritime and trade, technology and chemicals. All of these sectors are largely energy consumers for manufacturing and transportation.
In particular, we expect to continue the strong momentum we experienced in 2014 as we accelerated industrial organic growth in these end markets from minus 2% in Q1 to 7% in Q4. 
In summary, we had a positive finish to 2014. We continued to successfully scale IHS in each of our core industry markets globally. This gives IHS a unique market capability and presence in very connected markets and supply chains. The value of this breadth is evidenced by the current dynamic energy markets as IHS energy customers seek better understanding of risks and opportunities and each of our non-energy customers look to IHS to also help understand the impact of energy dynamics on their supply chains, costs and profitability.
As a result for 2015, we expect our resources in organic growth to moderate as we had seen in previous energy price cycles. We also expect our industrials and organic growth to continue to improve, driven by further positive impacts of new product and platform introductions and account initiatives in a strong environment for autos and maritime and trade and improving growth within technology and aerospace and defense.
And with that Iâll turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Thank you, Scott. Let's start by reviewing some of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Revenue was $582 million, an increase of 4%. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million, an increase of 10% and represented margin expansion of 170 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, an increase of 15%.
Relative to revenue, we reported solid quarter results in line with our expectations which included total revenue growth of 4%, acquisitions of 1% and FX drag of 1%.
FX negatively impacted revenue by $3 million in the quarter. Recall as we discussed our last quarterâs call, our Q4 reported growth rates for subscriptions, our EMEA and APAC regions and our resources product category were all negatively impacted due to difficult comparisons from prior year revenue catch up of several large energy past due renewals that drove 1% of additional subscription growth in Q4 of the prior year. To provide a more meaningful view of business performance for these areas my following revenue commentary will provide underlying normalized growth rates as well as reported growth rates.
In the quarter, subscriptions represented 76% of revenue and grew organically 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an underlying basis. Our non-subscription organic revenue declined 2% in Q4.
Looking at regional performance, Americas overall revenue growth was 3%, organic growth was 4%, and there was a 1% drag from FX. Americas' organic subscription revenue growth improved to 7% due to strong performance in our automotive product offerings.
EMEA's overall revenue growth was 5%, organic growth was 4%, and acquisitions added 2%. EMEA's organic subscription revenue growth was 5% with underlying growth of 6%.
APAC overall revenue growth was 10%, organic growth improved to 8%, acquisitions added 3% and there was a 1% drag from FX. APAC's organic subscription revenue growth was 6% with the underlying growth of 11%.
In summary we saw stable revenue across all regions with sequential improvement in our underlying subscription growth rate. Looking at industry performance, resources organic revenue growth was 2% with organic subscription growth of 6% and underlying organic subscription growth of 8%. Organic non subs growth was minus 10% and as discussed on last quarterâs call was negatively impacted by strong one time sales within our resources industry in the year ago quarter as well as lower energy software sales and degradation from a small non-core asset we plan to divest in 2015.
Industrials organic revenue growth improved to 7% and benefitted from strong performance in our automotive and maritime and trade offerings and a horizontal organic revenue growth was 3%.
Turning now to profits and margins, Q4 adjusted EBITDA totaled $186 million, up 10% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32% in Q4 and as expected we delivered strong margin growth in the quarter up 170 basis points versus last year.
Regarding segment profitability, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $143 million. EMEA's $43 million adjusted EBITDA was up 12% from the year ago quarter and APAC's adjusted EBITDA was $17 million versus $14 million from the year ago quarter.
Turning to adjusted EPS, Q4 increased to $1.68 per diluted share, a $0.22 or 15% improvement over the prior year. Adjusted EPS benefitted from solid operating performance and a lower tax rate due to discrete items. Our key financial highlights for the full year 2014 include revenue of $2.231 billion up 21% over the prior year with organic growth of over 4%, acquisition growth of 17% and minimal FX impact.
Normalized organic growth was 5% after adjustment for the prior year benefit of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code. Subscription organic growth was 6% for the year with subscription revenues representing 77% of total revenue. Non-subscription revenue declined 1% organically, but posted a 1% increase normalized for the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code.
Adjusted EBITDA was $690 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% up 40 basis points versus last year with margin expansion of over 150 basis points in the second half. 
For the year, our stock based compensation expense was $167 million up slightly from $162 million from the prior year and reflected good progress toward our goal to manage flat, stock based compensation expense and significantly reduce this expense as a percent of revenue.
Our full year GAAP ETR was 21.9% and benefitted from discrete items by approximately 2%. Our full year pre cash flow of $514 million increased by 27% and represented a 74% conversion rate. This rate was driven by solid operating performance and improvement in our cash collections. We are pleased with this conversion and the strong cash generation attributes of our business model. As we have discussed we are expecting free cash flow conversion in the mid-60s going forward due to increased interest expense and an increase in our cash taxes.
Turning to the balance sheet, our year end debt balance was $1.8 billion which represented a leverage ratio of approximately 2.6 times and we closed the year with $153 million of cash. Finally in the quarter, we completely the restructure of our bank credit facility and a $750 million notes offering with 8 year term and 5% interest cost. Our bank facility includes a $700 million 5 year term loan and $1.3 billion 5 year revolver of which $385 million was drawn at year end. The credit facility allows for leverage of 3.5 times with the ability to increase to 3.75 times for two quarters. These transactions provide us with capital structure flexibility and also derisk our capital structure by putting in place long term financing.
Moving to 2015 guidance. Our guidance is on an all-in basis and assumes no further acquisitions currency movements, pension mark to market adjustments or anticipated events. For 2015 we expect revenue in a range of $2.36 billion to $2.4 billion. Embedded in these guidance is organic subscription growth of 6% to 7% and neutral non-subs organic revenue growth.
This guidance reflects a thorough assessment of revenue risks and opportunities in each of our end markets including anticipated slower revenue growth within the energy market and current momentum in growth in the 60% of our business comprised of our non-energy product offerings, specifically our guidance incorporates a decline of 2% to 3% in our resources organic growth rate versus the prior year due to potential revenue risk related to the current energy market environment. We expect this will be offset by accelerated growth in our other product offerings primarily industrials.
Also embedded in our guidance is a negatively FX headwind of approximately $40 million and further reduction from potential divestitures of two small non-core assets. In terms of FX, approximately 20% of our revenue was non-U.S. dollar denominated. Our primary currency exposures are Great Britain Pound, Euro and Canadian Dollars. Current rates for these currencies have devalued respectively by 8%, 12% and 8% versus 2014 average exchange rates.
The FX and divestiture revenue reductions are mostly offset by revenue from acquisitions closed in Q4 2014 and in Q1 2015 through the time of this call. Over this period, we deployed $200 million of capital which represents approximately $65 million of revenue at our historic purchase price multiples. We also expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $750 million to $770 million. This represents reported margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $6.10 to $6.30 which includes depreciation of $82 million to $86 million, amortization of $135 million to $140 million, interest expense of $70 million to $75 million with an all in weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. Note that our weighted average interest rate and interest expense have increased versus the prior year due primarily to the $750 million notes offering completed in Q4.
Stock-based compensation expense of $150 million to $160 million which is down year-over-year and effective GAAP tax rate of 23% to 25%, and an adjusted effective tax rate of 27% to 29%, which assumes that tax rate on adjusted items of approximate 33%, and approximately $70 million fully diluted shares. Similar to prior years we expect revenue and profit to build throughout the year with Q1 typically being our weakest quarter and Q4 being our strongest.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results in Q4 and full year 2014 including improving revenue growth, good margin expansion in the back half of the year and strong full year cash flow demonstrating the financial strength of our business model.
Also, as outlined in our guidance section, we have a plan that balances risk in our energy markets with current moment in growth in the rest of our business. The plan also expands margins, balances continued investment in the business and itâs a plan that every IHS colleague and leaders focused on delivering.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Key
Thanks, Todd. A few closing comments. We had a positive finish to 2014, and have set a solid foundation for 2015. We remained focused on and are managing to our long term growth and profitability goals and commitments.
We continue to execute to our long term strategy and scaling IHS as the global, multi-industry provider of critical information, tools and technology, and research and analytics. We continue to see our strong free cash flows and profitability that is enhancing both our performance and long term organic potential and integrate seamlessly all of these capacities with key customer workflows and solutions.
We continue to scale and grow IHS across each of our core industries and horizontal offerings allowing us to delivery stable performance in dynamic market conditions. And we plan to continue to elevate the organic growth of IHS as we also expand margins based on the considerable operating leverage of our business model and our global infrastructure.
Our opportunity remains significant, and every IHS leader and colleague remains dedicated to continue to build our strong profitable growth Company, as weâve done for over a decade.
Todd and I are ready to answer your questions, so letâs get to the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question, and it comes from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Bill Warmington 
Happy New Year everyone.
Scott Key
Thanks, Bill, how are you?
Bill Warmington
Doing, okay. Thank you. Doing, okay. So, couple of initial questions. In the past weâve talked about roughly 60% of subscription business coming up for renewal in Q4 and Q1, just wanted to make sure that that figure was still accurate. And you mentioned that those renewals were going well. Maybe if you give some additional color around there?
Todd Hyatt
Yes. I think thatâs I think itâs roughly inline. Itâs about right. It varies from industry to industry. Certainly itâs an important renewal period, and particular in energy. And what weâre seeing is a positive renewal trends and also as we said, weâre seeing certainly broad-based strength in subscription growth, particular across industrials. So, weâre seeing good trends in energy, nothing that causes concern at this point. And weâre seeing very solid trends as indicated in the broad-based industrials growth we saw through the year. So, moving to a positive 7% organic in Q4 from a minus 2 in Q1, so really a very strong build in the 60% of our non-energy business.
Bill Warmington
Got it. And then one more, if I may. You guys have talked about of potential for expense reductions following the move of subscribers on to the IHS Connect platforms which is well underway and it seem like there was actually pretty significant by my calculation probably close to $100 million in cost cutting potential there. Just want to know if you can maybe talk about the timing of that and whether your perspective on that has changed?
Todd Hyatt
Thanks, Bill, We have significant operating leverage across the business which allows us to expand margin clearly at these growth levels, so we 6% subs growth for the full year, strong margin expansion of 170 basis points in Q4, 140 basis points in Q3 and 150 basis points for the second half of 2014. And what underlies that is both the synergies and platforms, the synergies in our global operations and leveraging our three centers of excellence for order to cash management customer care in finance. And all of these are leverage points for us and will continue to be that.
So what underlies our confidence in continued expansion of margins at these growth levels is at significant operating leverage, certainly the platforms is one of them. So the timing of that is over the next few years. Weâre going to continue realized synergies as we roll out this year into next year, and then synergies across the business over the next several years.
Bill Warmington
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the insights.
Todd Hyatt
Yes. Thanks Bill.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Please proceed.
Andrew Jeffrey
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate all the granularity on how youâre looking at the energy end markets in particular, guys. A couple of questions, one, I guess, I think Scott you mentioned an assumption for $59 oil, I assume thatâs Brent. As you look at oil trading in the mid 40s, mid to high 40s today, is there some sort of consideration for a potential rally. I think you said, you expect it to bottom in the spring. If oil were to stay at current levels does that of weigh in at the margin and your guidance?
Scott Key
Yes. Thanks, Andrew, and the 59 was West Texas intermediate, so a little bit different that Brent. Thatâs why a little bit of a spread between the two. But I think volatility; the question is what happens to production of the Middle East as prices stay a little bit below than what OPEC maybe thought they were going to be. So I think that factors in.
Weâve gone through many price, oil price cycles that IHS having a 50-year energy information business. Weâve got great experience with this and of course as we said 97% of our energy content revenues internationally come from our top customers, 60% or so in U.S. These are five decade long relationship. We support their daily activities and theyâve got good experience. So I think weâve factored all of that in as we said in some detail in the comments.
And I appreciate your comment, because the transparency and visibility for you is important right now. We support a broad range of activities and daily operations across energy companies not just exploration activity which gets impact from the lower price environment. So I think our view of that uncertainty in the full year is reflected and the guidance we have and gives us a lots of flexibility. So weâve really derisked our organic growth in the 6% to 7% range for subs and in the revenue numbers weâve given you.
Andrew Jeffrey
Okay. Thatâs helpful. This is my first energy cycle with IHS, so apologize. And then it seems like there are couple offsets to lower energy revenue, one being as you imagine in industries and the other I suppose is the ongoing rollout of your workflows and your top 1000 account focus. Could you kind of talk at least directionally as to how much either of those might be contributing to the offset that gets you to that 6% to 7% subs organic revenue growth number for the year?
Scott Key
Well, a couple of things, weâre seeing positive dynamics as we scale the industrial teams and that is associated with rolling our platforms like in chemicals. Our new economic stimulation tools that go across industries, new automotive offerings and weâve seen those elevate our industrial performance all through last year, hitting a high in Q4, which of course sets the stage for 2015 subscriptions.
And as Todd indicated you know the underlying subscription growth in energy once you take the Q4, 2013 unusual items was really strong 8% and so really across the business we were building momentum. So weâve got a little bit of headwind here thatâs slowing our organic growth elevation and acceleration. But we still see all those elements, platforms, new customers, all of our sales activities, all the realignment in the Americas, all of these are going to contribute to improving organic growth that IHS and the headwind will just slow us a little.
Andrew Jeffrey
Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Gary Bisbee
Hi, guys. Good morning. I wonder if I could dig in a little bit to the very positive commentary around the industrials business. What are the drivers there beyond falling in the fully I guess [indiscernible] are there are some other real positive dynamics and obviously that business will see more difficult comps a quarter or two from now. So how confident are you in the sustainability of that strong trend youâre talking about?
Todd Hyatt
Thanks, Gary. Well, itâs pretty actually broad based. So for an example, maritime trade had organic growth that was accretive to the reported levels at IHS. So it was a positive driver as we indicated a minute ago. Autos and not just becoming organic in Q4, but as you know we launch six new products within the first six months of acquiring Polk. So the scale that weâve achieved in automotive allows us to do things we never could do before and of course those are building and they will continue to build. So we also see improving trends both in technology, and aerospace and defense. So, all of those are elevating organic growth levels from 2014.
We continue to see despite some challenging chemicals really strong performance there as we did all year last year. So all of these would have been part of the 12 quarter path that would have elevated us, pretty broad-based across many industries, all improving and I think weâll see those dynamics continue as we really get these integrated scale, product and solution engines out in to market and with customers.
Gary Bisbee
And then follow-up question, just on the sales initiative, can you be a little more specific, how far along you are in each region and you said a minute ago that you expected that to be a positive contributor to growth. Is that â is the Americas getting close to being done? Is that outlook for 2015 just less distraction because of all the changes you made in 2014 or we still a ways from â few quarters away from getting that business really having the sales changes behind them? Thank you.
Scott Key
Yes. Its real quick, weâre about a year and a half into pretty stable structure in EMEA. We see that despite the economic challenges in EMEA we see really solid growth at the kind of levels that weâre driving the whole company to. Americas, sales changes are always the slowest and most complex. You want to be less disruptive. Weâre ways down the road in Americas, we probably have another four to six quarters of work to do, but weâll see continuous improvement along the way. So weâre working our way there. Itâs our largest region of course and complex set of offerings across IHS which weâre streamlining and aligning sales to. But I think next six quarters or so. Thanks Gary.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Peter Appert
Thanks. Good morning.
Scott Key
Hi, Peter.
Todd Hyatt
Good morning, Peter.
Peter Appert
Scott, historically, I think the energy business had margins I believe were significantly higher than the other segments. So Iâm wondering how you address that issue in terms slower growth there maybe you putting margins pressure on the overall organization. And related to that, Iâm wondering if thereâs youâd call out in terms of seasonality in margins that we should anticipate in 2015?
Scott Key
Yeah. And Iâll make couple of comments, and then hand it to Todd. So, we really strong â again if you think about our business we outline for energy, content, expertise and then software, the content and expertise pieces across IHS are high margin businesses, whether its an automotive or aerospace and defense, our software tends to be high margin businesses. So, we benefit margins as industrial grows and itâs a positive contributor.
Todd Hyatt
Yeah. The thing I would add to that is. Peter, I think youâre right that the average margin is probably higher in energy, but on the incremental dollar of growth, the flow through across the portfolio in the subscription and the data content business is very, very high irrespective of the areas.
Peter Appert
A good point. Good point, Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Yeah. Thanks Peter.
Peter Appert
And Todd, could I ask one other?
Todd Hyatt
Sure.
Peter Appert
You cycled through obviously Polk. To get closer to the long term revenue targets youâve talked about in the past, maybe another large M&A transaction maybe necessary in 2015, how youâre thinking about that?
Todd Hyatt
I mean, we continue to track a robust M&A pipeline. I think weâve done deals that are consistent with the type of deals that weâve done in the past. I think the timing and actionability of larger deals is always very hard to predict.
Scott Key
And weâve deployed $400 million or so of free cash flow a year to those kind of average assets, $30 million or so at revenue. We are developing $500 million of free cash flow a year, so thatâs kind of basis which we started to follow the same. But weâve got a pretty broad-based growth right now and that was really taken us to our goals, the 12 quarter goals we outlined. Maybe a little slower progress towards that goal with a bit of an energy headwind, but we see that as clearly offset by really strong broad-based growth across rest of IHS. So a good balance and acquisitions will continue to find the right assets to enhance the long term potential.
Peter Appert
Thank you.
Scott Key
Thanks Peter.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell from William Blair. Please proceed.
Brandon Dobell
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Scott Key
Thanks, Brandon.
Brandon Dobell
Maybe you could give us some color on where you guys finished the year in terms of sales headcount, where we should expect that to go in this coming year and I guess within that, is there a significant change in productivity that you guys have assumed in the revenue guidance especially as you think about the energy sector?
Scott Key
Yeah. Pretty consistent in terms of headcount, but it change in where those resources are focused. So as weâve said, weâve transitioned more into inside sales, so we can more efficiently handled smaller renewals with the field sales more aggressively looking at new growth and high opportunity accounts and then build in the Target 1000.
So probably the mix of overall resources Brandon not shifted materially, but getting more efficient as we align to industries, as we align to high opportunity at counts. And I donât think thatâs different across the portfolio regarding to this process everywhere and it should benefit us in terms of sales productivity over the next six to eight to 12 quarters. There will be a good contributor to grow. Thanks, Brandon. 
Brandon Dobell
Okay.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please proceed.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I just want to continue to kind of follow down the energy path and I want to ask just what was the energy organic growth and total growth in fiscal year 2014, and then what are the parameters you guys are putting around that in fiscal year 2015? Because the WTI sounds to me like youâre looking for similar patent to what happened in 2009 if you take the average WTI during that year, I think you came out about 61, 62, you expect a little bit lower than that, but it seems like the confidence in the energy vertical doing better than it was beforehand is much higher. Where the average organic growth I think through the year was probably the 1% to 2%. So Iâm just trying to kind of put the parameters around that and understand a little bit better what youâre expecting in terms of the patterns?
Todd Hyatt
Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate that. so, if you look at the full year resources that about 5% organic and of course Q4 was the low, but if you offset for the one-times and the Q4, 2013, that depressed the Q4 comparison, we had really solid subscription organic growth in Q4 as we finished the year and then non-subscription that was slightly negative. So that depressed the overall numbers and full year numbers. If we look at the last cycle and it kind of taking everything into consideration slightly different business back then that we have right now thatâs where we get to 200 to 300 basis points from current growth levels in energy.
And if you look at Q1, 2014 to Q4 performance in industrials, the full year level about 4%, we finished the year at 7%. So we really have an industrials business thatâs roughly the same size as energy. The level of elevation we see in that business and that weâre delivering today is about the pressure we see and have seen previously in energy. So thatâs kind of how we look at it, Shlomo. Weâve gone through to great detail in every portion of our energy business to understand where the risk is. Thanks.
Scott Key
And thatâs really what I laid out in the guidance, Shlomo. When I went through and talked about two to three potential revenue risk in energy from the market dynamics, offset by the rest of the business primarily the industrials.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Right. I mean, the key concern from investors here there is good guidance and the question is this just kind of setup for lowering the guidance later on if we donât see a snapback like we did see in 2009, I mean thatâs kind of the main question I think that people going to have right now?
Scott Key
And the answer is no. The answer to that is really simple, no. We are ready to â if itâs a new normal at $50 oil â in 2009 we had $12 oil and the same information business that was pretty robust business. So weâre critical to customers. Weâve got 50 year relationships. Weâve grown the business when oil was as I said in single-digits and low double-digits and thatâs factored in. It is fully factored into our guidance and we expect pretty moderate energy environment for the full year. Thereâs not going to be a snapback likely until maybe 2016 as broader economic conditions lift energy demand in places like China.
So, our guidance does not expect any second half snapback of energy price in anyway shape or form. Any kind of Brent to WTI between 40 and 60 is kind of what weâre factoring in for the full year. And then of course thereâs benefits of that to lower energy cost in the rest of our business which is 60% of revenue. So weâre not setting up for anything like that. Weâre setting up to â weâve meet or exceeded the key financial metrics for the last six quarters, and weâve got guidance that it allows us to meet those financial metrics all through this year.
Now organic growth maybe a little bit below where we would have liked to have seen it by half a point for 2014. But weâve got all the elements working to continue to stabilize and elevate our growth even in the face of some energy headwinds. Thanks. Appreciate it, Shlomo.
Operator
Thanks. Our next question comes from Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anj Singh
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Building a lot of bit on the previous ones could you tell us a little bit about the strength youâre assuming in autos? Would you say that this is a function more of your push efforts versus the underlying demand? And is there a possibility that with auto market having bounced back considerably since the recession that the demand portion growth, I mean, it begin to flatten?
Todd Hyatt
Yes. Great question. A lot of the growth that weâre seeing both in maritime and trade, and in automotive, which are two stronger areas, but as well as in aerospace and defense and technology is because weâre doing new things. Weâve combined capabilities in new ways. So weâre got new products in the market that are just beginning to transform how automotives Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 suppliers in OEMs conduct their business.
Weâre helping them in ways that no ones being able to help them before because the breadth that what weâve brought together in IHS. So weâre just on the beginning edge of the trend of new products and new solutions which transform our value, and as with energy what they pay us is a fraction of their total OpEx and CapEx. So these are relatively inexpensive solutions that have large impact which of course is why we see stability in energy even in a downturn. But weâve got many, many years of evolution of maritime and trade with new capabilities, expansion in automotive and new platforms in aerospace and defense are lifting that business out of more historic lows for the last few years, and the same in technology. So we see as broad-based trends that have several years to play out and arenât really a market demand driven, I think our market industry growth driven is better way to say it.
Anj Singh
Okay. Thank you. And one other question. How does the impact of oil prices or what is the impact of oil prices on your M&A plans? Are your targets in the energy space now more attractive than before and do you plan on being more or less acquisitive in the energy space for 2015 and going forward?
Scott Key
Weâre patient acquirer and we track assets for years, and years, and years. So havenât seen really any indications of that. We look for the right capabilities and we are then very careful about paying the right price and weâre patient to ensure we do that. So I donât think it changes â we have an opportunity to scale continued automotive, in chemicals, in maritime and trade. The most scale business we have is energy. Number two is automotive and we see the benefits of that broad-based capacity at IHS across connected supply chain. So weâre going to continue to scale across industries but find the right assets at the right time. Thanks. Thanks for the question.
Anj Singh
Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please proceed.
Manav Patnaik
Hi. Thank you. Good morning guys. I just wanted to dig into the decline of I guess 2% to 3% points you said in the resources organic growth in 2015. How does that split between energy and chemicals? I miss sort of your commentary on the chemical side. And also I think on the question around renewals you said those nothing of concern in energy at this point in time. So is most of that decline in energy that â 2015 on the non-sub side or you anticipating something to change in the back half of the year in the sub side?
Scott Key
Iâll make a couple of comments and then handover to Todd for his comments. One, weâve had very strong chemicals growth all through 2014, we expected throughout 2015. So we expected that to continue. So chemicals, we are offering great new solutions with integrated capabilities that are of high value to chemicals customers. Iâd say that, what you saw in Q4 was again as Todd indicated the impact of the year-on-year comparison in resources both on the subs and non-subs. We had really strong accretive subs organic growth in energy and resources in Q4, and slightly negative on the sub side. But I think Todd, weâd indicated probably the greatest pressure is on non-sub and subs as we saw in 2008, 2009.
Todd Hyatt
Yes, weâve given 2% to 3% potential risk in the energy environment and weâve also given in 80/20 sub, non-sub revenue mix. But weâve certainly would expect the risk to be weighted higher on the non-subs than the subs. Yeah, I think on Q4, and Scott talk about this, a very good renewal and actually saw that with energy and delivery of what weâve talked about on the Q3 call relative to the underlying growth rates on subscriptions and on resources subscriptions. And Q1 as Scott said, the business is performing â itâs performing well. Weâre certainly being prudent in terms of how we laid out the guidance for 2015.
Scott Key
And just to be clear, so in energy, discretionary spend is going to slow as people watch their budgets. But as we said, the vast majority of our revenue is associated with subscriptions that have been in place for many decades, in some cases a half a century and our critical to companyâs daily performance. And so the vast majority of our revenues are tied to that daily operations and the last point we said this many times, what they are paying us for what we help them with is insignificant in terms of their capital and operating expense programs.
So, we are not an opportunity to save money. Weâre an opportunity to help them understand current market. So, thatâs why weâve always had positive energy dynamics. But thanks for the questions.
Todd Hyatt
Thanks, Next, operator.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Please proceed.
Andrew Steinerman
Hi, there.
Scott Key
Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Steinerman
My question was about the resources comment you made about non-subs. It was a tough year-over-year comp this fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter, fourth quarter 2013. What was the organic growth of non-subs in that year ago quarter and what drove the one-time benefit in that year ago quarter?
Todd Hyatt
It was a great question. It was a pretty positive number year ago and I think weâll dig that out for you. But it was just one-time software, itâs a range of really positive and strength on the software side, and then on the subscriptions side which you see in the EMEA numbers the APAC numbers and the overall resources number was a catch up in subscription, So pretty strong set of catch ups on delayed contract renewals that hit in Q4 a year ago.
Andrew Steinerman
And how this non-subs resources piece look into the first quarter meaning like is there another tough year-over-year comp in the first quarter?
Scott Key
No. After the comp in Q4, it was slightly negative on a non-sub side, but I donât â thereâs no specific items that we called out a year ago Todd.
Todd Hyatt
No. We didnât talk about anything in Q1 last year. But thatâs where we will see some pressure, but again its 20% of the business and we see positive trends on the sub side right now.
Andrew Steinerman
And energy software shows up in subs and non-subs or just in a non-subs?
Scott Key
It shows up in both. Yes, shows up in both. The new sales which is new license, similar of what we saw on subscription basis software, other is perpetual with maintenance, the maintenance shows up in subs, the new sales shows up in non-subs. Thanks Andrew.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Paul Ginocchio
I just want to follow-up on that last question. So, have you seen any sort of â in the fourth quarter it sounds like it was all a tougher comp or was there â do you think or was there some impact from the decline energy prices? And then looking back to 2008 or 2009, how many quarters do they take from the decline in oil prices for to show up in non-sub things, then get a quick follow up on acquisitions.
Todd Hyatt
Well in Q4, Paul in my comments I talked about â we had a very very strong Q4 of last year on the non-subs in energy. This year what I called out were we had lower software by $1 million to $2 million in the quarter and we also had a drag from a non strategic asset that we talked about in terms of disposition in the future, so those were the two forces that we talked about or the three items that we talked about in Q4. What was the other part of the question?
Yeah, just about the historic and Iâd say Paul we were a few points negative in Q4 and so as that an early sign we had really strong sales a year ago, it might be a little dipped. Subs performed pretty well and the renewal is performing pretty well, but on the non-recurring side you know we have talked about a large energy consulting contract in India, we have got a similar one in Mexico that represented about 10% of the full year consulting revenue is already booked. So weâve got some offsetting factors but we would see that pretty quickly in the non-subs, but again itâs 20% of the business and the businesses growth will be driven by the 80% of that subs.
Paul Ginocchio
Okay. And looking back to the last cycleâ¦.
Todd Hyatt
And just a minute Paul, just to give you some context, because you know in terms of the software so a resources business of $925 million energy is about 90% of that. The software piece of energy is 2% to 3% of that total. And that software piece is made up of exploration software and itâs also made up of production software, so the dynamic in the market place that Scott talked about in his comments, on the exploration part of the business we expect to see weakness. And I talked about the $1 million to $2 million in Q4 thatâs what we saw. We also believe that there is opportunity to have some level of offset on the production software part of the business which helps with productivity from a production perspective. So, just to size the numbers, this is certainly an area that we are watching but itâs not a hugely material element.
Scott Key
Just mindful of the time, so weâll jump onto the next one. Next question, operator. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
Joseph Foresi
Hi, I was wondering the last time we went to this oil cycle, was there a lag time associated with the cycle and do you have a rough idea what the â how many quarters there were in that lag time and then I have one follow up.
Scott Key
Yeah, as we just said the non-recurring not a lot of lag, those are 30, 60, 90 days sales cycle and so you know not really material so weâll see it develop in the years based â baked into our guidance. On the subscription side itâs a little bit smaller but weâre seeing â we are now seeing what we are going to see in 2016 through the renewal process and thatâs been pretty stable thus far which would suggest a year from now pretty stable and weâll keep you updated but I think all of those factors are baked into the 2%, 3% headwinds which we see offset by industrials positive growth and weâll go onto the next question with as just in the interest of time.
Eric Boyer
Thanks, operator. Next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin
Hi, good morning. I apologize if I missed this, but I heard a lot on the energy versus non-energy growth expectations and then a lot of detail on energy specifically but I recall here an assumption for overall subscription versus non-subscription growth for 2015 and also if you could share any thoughts there?
Todd Hyatt
Yeah we said that subscription will be 6% to 7% for the full year and thatâs what embedded in the guidance and non-subscription neutral and that incorporates both energy and non-energy. So neutral on the non-subscription as reported for the full year and subscription at 6% to 7% which elevates us from the reported levels of 6% and pretty consistent with the underlying levels of 7 we delivered in Q4, but thanks Andre. Next question, operator.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Munis [ph] from Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes thank you. Can you guys talk about the energy subscription business in terms of the growth over the last couple of years? Can you break it down between how much of has come from things like you know platform conversion versus underlying price lift versus new customers versus new data sets of solutions or some sort of breakdown like that please? Thanks guys.
Scott Key
Yes a lot of our energy growth has been by taking broad capabilities and fully embedding them across energy companies. So for example we help with productivity in a refinery. A few years ago it might have been one refinery that our software tools of data and technology analytics were deployed. We then expand across the company to every refinery.
So expanding our presence in the account has been a big driver you know we talk about price being 3% to 4% but this expansion and capability as weâve expanded capability across IHS has really been the most significant driver such as building relationships and growing them because of breadth of capability and then breadth of usage inside the company, those have been the drivers. Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
Scott Key
Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Silber
Thank you so much. How are you doing? You mentioned your energy exposure was about 40% of total revenue results. I was wondering if you can give us those details by major geography Americas, EMEA and APAC. Are you seeing any difference across those?
Scott Key
It roughly follows our revenue splits and 60% of revenues comes from the Americas that include Canada and Latin America you know and then we are about 10% to 15% in APAC and the remaining you know 30% or so sits in EMEA. Thatâs really the split but thereâs a differentiator and the types of customers the U.S. Americas is the only place where you have small independents because of land ownership, so you know about 300 accounts internationally 97% are large ones as we said mostly with multiyear agreements so weâre going to have pretty stable 2015,pretty stable2016, 2017. Opportunities, ageing companies and Chinese, Middle East look for an opportunity in order to buy distressed [ph] assets in the Americas, but the mix follows the overall company the dynamics are a little bit different. But as we said fewer independents now than they were in 2008 and so mostly large customers that have been customers for decades. Thanks for the question.
Jeff Silber
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley is our last question. Please proceed.
Toni Kaplan
Hi, thanks for taking my question. So when we look back to the last time the price of oil fell, can you talk about the pricing dynamics within subscriptions for the energy offerings. Thanks
Scott Key
Yes you know as oil prices were rising through 2005 through 2008 we were driving a lot of new platforms and new values so we had a very strong price environment, that came back to kind of the price environment we see right now with the majors which are you know 3% to 4% mindful of those long term relationships, probably a little more challenged on pricing and weâll be careful with smaller independents, but pricing dynamics now not a lot different than we saw back then Toni.
Toni Kaplan
