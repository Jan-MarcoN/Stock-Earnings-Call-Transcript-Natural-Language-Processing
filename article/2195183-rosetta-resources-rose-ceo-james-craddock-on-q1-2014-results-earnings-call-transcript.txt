James E. Craddock
Thanks, Toni. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning.
With the first quarter of 2014 now in the rearview mirror, we are firmly focused on the path ahead and taking the steps necessary to deliver on our annual targets. We will continue to expand our operations in the Delaware Basin, as we work to fully evaluate our acreage position.
Our first quarter results represent a great combination of core assets in the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin. So let's review our list of accomplishments for the quarter. We set all-time records in daily total equivalent production, daily oil production and daily natural gas liquids production. We increased total daily production by 16% versus 2013. We advanced our horizontal development activities in the Delaware Basin, completing 2 operated wells and participating in the completion of 5 partner-operated wells.
We closed the previously announced Delaware Basin bolt-on acquisition, adding 5,000 net acres in our Reeves County core area. We drilled 2 additional Upper Eagle Ford pilot areas to test increasing recovery of incremental resources. And we doubled our Permian horizontal project inventory to approximately 900 net locations.
Let's step through our first quarter highlights in more detail. Production for the quarter averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 16% from the same period in 2013 and 5% from the prior quarter. Our favorable production growth trend is a result of the ongoing successful development of our Eagle Ford assets and the growing contribution of our Permian Basin assets.
Oil production in the first quarter averaged 16,000 barrels per day, an increase of 30% from 2013. Natural gas liquids daily production also increased by 12% compared to the prior year. We achieved 7% year-over-year and 4% quarterly growth versus the prior year on Eagle Ford production at 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
The Permian contributed 4,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Permian volumes increased by 23% versus the fourth quarter. Our Permian production is comprised of 87% total liquids, including 75% oil and is on trend to add an oil-rich component to the growth -- long-term growth of our company.
Another accomplishment in the first quarter was the completion of 2 operated horizontal wells in Reeves County. We now have 5 operated horizontal wells producing from the Wolfcamp A and plan to complete 4 to 8 horizontal wells during the second quarter. We're very excited about the results of our Permian horizontal program and the activity we are monitoring from industry. We will discuss some of the industry activity around our acreage later in the call.
In the Eagle Ford, we added 2 more Upper Eagle Ford pilot areas, a 3-well test on the L&E lease and an 11-well test at Gates Ranch. Gates Ranch now has 3 Upper Eagle Ford pilots on test, the first of which has been underway for just about a year. The second pilot located in the far south area has been on test for approximately 9 months. We'll provide more detail about our Eagle Ford pilot test in our operational remarks.
As outlined in our earnings press release, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance for capital, production and expenses. We're on track to spend $1.1 billion of capital for the year, excluding acquisition capital. We continue to project that 2014 average daily production guidance range of 60,000 to 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We plan to operate 4 to 5 rigs in the Eagle Ford area and 5 to 6 rigs in the Delaware Basin in the second quarter.
We are expanding our Reeves County horizontal program in 2014 to include additional tests of the Lower Wolfcamp benches and Third Bone Springs. Where necessary, we'll continue to drill vertical wells to hold acreage or gain data across our Permian Basin lease positions.
In summary, our early 2014 performance provides a good foundation for the remainder of the year. We're fully committed to the execution of our business and operational plan. We look forward to sharing our next update on our Eagle Ford development and the progress of our horizontal program in Reeves County.
Now let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide a summary of our financial results.
John E. Hagale
Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone. As a reminder, all of the information I'm reviewing today is contained in our 10-Q, as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC yesterday and are available on our website.
Net income for the first quarter 2014 was $35 million or $0.57 per diluted share versus net income of $53 million or $1.01 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income, that's non-GAAP, for the quarter was $46 million or $0.74 per diluted share versus $62 million or $1.18 per diluted share a year ago.
First quarter 2014 adjusted net income excludes an unrealized derivative loss of $16 million and transaction and financing cost of a little less than $0.5 million. The after tax total for all those adjustments was $10 million. Adjusted net income decreased versus 2013, primarily due to higher DD&A rate and some cash expenses, somewhat offset by higher production and higher realized natural gas prices.
On the revenue side, please note that our oil revenues include condensate sales, which represent about 54% of our total oil production. Revenues for the first quarter were $215 million compared to $178 million for the same period in 2013. First quarter revenues, including realized derivatives, were $230 million in 2014 and $192 million in 2013.
Our first quarter average realized oil price, excluding derivatives, was $90.62 per barrel, down $7.82 from the prior year, but up $2.02 from the fourth quarter average of $88.60 a barrel. Our realized oil price for the first quarter relative to LLS was lower than we expected, primarily due to lower realized oil prices in the Permian Basin due to some refinery downtime and some pipeline constraints, as well as some unexpected Eagle Ford third-party facility issues that required us to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford condensate on the lease at a significant discount.
At this time, the Eagle Ford facility issues have been resolved, but due to lower prices in the first quarter, as well as the risk of some lower prices in the Permian, we are widening our total company full year oil price range to roughly LLS minus $11 to $13.
As Jim mentioned earlier, we reaffirmed our expense guidance for 2014 in yesterday's earnings release, and we outlined those numbers again on Slide 3. I want to remind you that we'll continue to -- the practice of providing our annual guidance. We maintained an active and disciplined hedging strategy and looked for opportunities to add derivative positions to our production, when pricing conditions warrant. A detailed summary of our derivative positions as of April 30 is attached to the press release.
Finally, on financing, on April 2, the company amended its credit facility, increasing the borrowing base from $800 million to $950 million. The committed amount under the credit facility was reconfirmed at $800 million. On April 30, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding, with $650 million available to borrow under the credit facility. Yesterday, we redeemed our 9.5% senior notes with borrowings under our credit facility for a total payment of $211 million, which includes the principal amount, a make- whole premium and accrued unpaid interest.
Now let me turn the call over to John Clayton for operational comments.
John D. Clayton
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my remarks with a summary of our first quarter operational results. Then as I mentioned on last quarter's call, I will provide an update on our Upper Eagle Ford pilot program. Finally, I will go through an update of the activities in the Delaware Basin.
Now let's review our first quarter 2014 operational performance. Excluding acquisitions, capital spending for the quarter was $361 million, and we drilled 47 gross operated wells and completed 54. Of those 54 completions, 45 were placed on production. Our total first quarter daily production averaged 54,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 16% from the prior year.
Looking at the quarter in a little more detail, the month of January came in at 50,600 BOEs per day, February was 54,800 BOEs per day, and the month of March came in at 57,500 BOEs per day. Total Eagle Ford production in the first quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 7% from a year ago. The total company's first quarter 2014 production rate includes 16,100 barrels of oil per day and 18,600 barrels of NGLs per day.
Oil production for the quarter increased by 30% when compared to 2013. Overall liquids production for the quarter represented about 64% of total production, which is up from 62% a year ago. Oil production represented 30% of total production, up from 26% a year ago.
Slide 4 shows our production and resource growth trends since 2009, the year of our initial Eagle Ford discovery well. The chart highlights the steady growth of our Eagle Ford production, and now, the increasing Permian contribution. Our 2014 production guidance range is also included on the chart, which will give us 20% to 30% growth year-over-year.
During the quarter, we continued our Lower Eagle Ford development activities at Gates Ranch, Briscoe Ranch and on our Central Dimmit County properties. At Gates Ranch, our row development continued, as we turned the corner from our second row to our third row on the east side of the field, where 30 wells were drilled and 8 wells were completed.
Since Gates Ranch is our largest contiguous lease, it gets a lot of external attention. However, our non-Gates Eagle Ford properties are now contributing roughly 40% of our total Eagle Ford production, which is something that is often overlooked. So here's some brief highlights for the quarter from those assets.
At Briscoe Ranch in Dimmit County, 12 wells were completed and placed on production in March. Development continued on the oilier Tom Hanks lease in Northwest LaSalle County, where 11 wells were completed during the quarter, with 5 of them being brought online in March as well.
With regards to Tom Hanks, you can now see our type curve we are using for this property on Slide #5 of the presentation. This area is expected to produce 346,000 BOEs per well, of which 82% is oil. Our total remaining inventory on the lease is 40 wells spaced at 400 feet between each other. Typical well economics for this type curve yield an after-tax rate of return of approximately 50%.
Moving over to our Central Dimmit County assets, a total of 7 wells were completed on the Vivion, Light Ranch and L&E leases, 5 of which were placed on production at various times of the quarter.
Finally, as you know, Rosetta has roughly 13,000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play, and we like the option value that these assets provide us. With that said, during the quarter, we drilled and completed one horizontal well on our dry gas properties.
That's a quick wrap-up of the quarterly activity. And now as I promised you last quarter, I would like to update you on our Eagle Ford program, specifically, the Upper Eagle Ford. We started this program in May of last year. In Slide 7 is a locator map of our 4 Upper Eagle Ford pilots that we have done to date. I would like to walk you through our thought process on these assets and how we allocated our new venture capital towards this play type.
Please turn to Slide 8, as it has some general data on it that I will use to describe the play. Here, we are using a type log from the southern part of Gates Ranch. If you look at the brackets on the left, you will see that the total Eagle Ford thickness is approximately 280 feet, made up of 90 feet of Lower Eagle Ford and 190 feet of Upper Eagle Ford. If you then look inside the far left side of the log, you will see a rectangular black box. This is where we place our Lower Eagle Ford horizontal wells.
Based on our internal data, we have highlighted in red the thickness of the Eagle Ford that we believe is being effectively stimulated by our Lower Eagle Ford wells. This red interval covers the bottom 150 feet of the Eagle Ford above the Buda formation. Note that this red box does not represent only the Lower Eagle Ford, which is 90 feet thick in this example. It also represents 60 feet of the Upper Eagle Ford as well.
Now look at the area highlighted in yellow on the log. It is our belief that this vertical interval is the section of the Eagle Ford that is not being effectively stimulated by the Lower Eagle Ford well placement. As you can see, the yellow box does not represent the entire Upper Eagle Ford, but only the portion of the Upper Eagle Ford that is greater than 150 feet above the top of the Buda formation. In this case, the thickness of the yellow box, or the area that is not being effectively stimulated, is 130-feet thick. So using this generic type log, our upper Eagle Ford pilot wells are testing the recovery of the yellow box.
Please turn to Slide 9, where you will see 2 type logs. The one on the left is the same Gates south type log that was on the previous slide. The type curve on the right represents our Tom Hanks lease in Northeast LaSalle County, about 60 miles northeast of Gates Ranch. By looking at our Lower Eagle Ford well placement in the black box and shading in the bottom 150 foot in red to represent the effectively stimulated rock, you can see that there is no ineffectively stimulated rock remaining; hence, no yellow box on the top of the red. This means that we do not believe that all areas of the Eagle Ford trend are candidates for adding Upper Eagle Ford wells. Our Tom Hanks lease is one of these areas.
Now please turn to the next slide, Slide #10. This slide represents our leases that we have or plan to have pilot testing of Upper Eagle Ford wells: East Gates, South Gates, Central Dimmit, North Gates and Briscoe Ranch.
Before we review the results so far, it is important to see where the pilots are and the type of sub-surface we are testing. Pilot #1 is in East Gates. Here, the targeted thickness in yellow is 110-feet thick. The landing interval of the upper test well is indicated by the bright blue rectangle and was placed in the very upper part of the targeted interval. This pilot has 6 months of -- excuse me, 8 months of production, and I will show you its data shortly.
Pilot #2 is in South Gates and is the third log from the left. Here, the targeted thickness is 125 feet. This pilot has 2 upper test wells. They, too, were also placed in the very upper part of the targeted interval. This pilot has been on production for approximately 7 months.
Pilot #3 is all the way over in Central Dimmit County on our L&E lease and is the fourth log from the left. Here, our targeted thickness is 160 feet. As you can see, we changed the placement of the pilot well and put it more towards the center of our target. It is closer to the area in red that we believe has been effectively stimulated by the Lower Eagle Ford well, but it is also -- has more unstimulated rock above the pilot well. We do know that fracs are more effective in height growth above the wellbore than below it, and this location is testing that concept.
Pilot #4 is back in East Gates and is represented by the second log from the left. It is located just south of pilot #1. Here, we drilled 5 pilot wells. Three wells using the same completion design were placed in the upper target, the middle target and the bottom of the target immediately above the red area. Wells 4 and 5 were also placed in the upper target. However, they each use a different completion technique than the other 3 wells in this pilot.
That's a summary of what we have done so far. We also have plans to perform additional pilot testing at our North Gates Ranch and Briscoe Ranch areas, where we have targeted thicknesses of 190 feet and 245 feet, respectively.
Now let's look at the next few slides and look at the production results so far, so please turn to Slide #11. This is pilot #1. This production plot has the upper pilot well production in dark black and the underlying Lower Eagle Ford average well production in light gray. The light gray production is within the range of what we would expect from our North Central type curve. We also do not believe that the Lower Eagle Ford well performance has altered -- has been altered by having an Upper Eagle Ford well. The upper well has produced roughly 110,000 BOEs over its first 8 months of life. And the EUR is in the 200,000 to 400,000 BOE range.
Now let's turn to pilot #2 on Slide 12. This pilot has 2 upper pilot wells, and their average production rate is shown in dark black, and the underlying 3 Lower Eagle Ford well averages are shown in light gray. The lightweight -- the light gray wells are also producing within the expected range of what we would expect in our far south type curve area. And we do not believe that the Lower Eagle Ford well production performance has been altered by the upper wells. The upper wells have produced, on average, 120,000 BOEs each over the first 8 months of their lives. And their average EUR is in the 250,000 to 400,000 BOE range.
Now let's turn to pilot #3 on Slide 13, which is over in Central Dimmit County on our L&E lease. The single upper pilot well was drilled in the middle of the targeted interval. Although this well has only been online for 3 months, it is producing very similar to its Lower Eagle Ford counterparts. The upper and lower wells on this pilot have cumed approximately 50,000 to 55,000 BOEs each in the first 85 days of their lives. Both the lower and upper wells are tracking within the range of our L&E type curve, which is about 900,000 BOEs. However, as you can see, it is very early in the life of all of these wells.
Let's go back to East Gates Ranch and look at Pilot #4 on Slide 14. Although Pilot #4 has not yet been brought on production, I wanted to update you on where we are today with this pilot. This pilot has 5 wells drilled in our target interval. We are testing 2 concepts with this pilot. The first is a landing interval. And as you can see, we have drilled a well in the lower target area, the middle target area and the upper target area. The only variable on these wells is the landing area. Everything else has been held constant. We are also testing different completion techniques. As a result, we have drilled 2 more wells in the upper target area that each has a unique completion design.
Please turn to Slide 15, as it outlines and compares the first 4 Upper Eagle Ford pilot areas and the 2 potential new pilot areas where the thickness zones are yet to be tested. So with all that said, let me summarize our pilots, thus far, by making the following points: Number one, the Upper Eagle Ford has different reservoir characteristics than the Lower Eagle Ford, and as a result, we are treating it as a separate reservoir from the Lower Eagle Ford.
Number two, we do believe that our Lower Eagle Ford wells are effectively stimulating the bottom portion of the Upper Eagle Ford; therefore, our targeted interval is anything above 150 feet from the top of the Buda.
Number three, so far, the Upper Eagle Ford wells do not appear to be influencing the underlying Lower Eagle Ford wells.
Number four, Gates Ranch Upper Eagle Ford wells are performing less than their lower counterparts. We believe this is a function of different reservoir and rock qualities, not well interference. As a result of this different reservoir type, the EURs thus far at Gates are estimated to be between 200,000 and 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per well.
Number five, our Central Dimmit County pilot is an interesting one. Although it has a thicker target, it is also the only one, so far, that we have data on, where we have landed lower in the targeted interval. The upper well here is producing on par with its lower counterparts, and all are producing in line with our 900,000 BOE type curve for this area. It is very early though, but we are cautiously optimistic with what we have seen so far.
Lastly, we will be bringing on pilot wells at Gates Ranch to test moving lower into the target interval on Pilot #4. We also have plans to begin testing pilots in North Gates and Briscoe, where we have a thicker targeted interval more similar to that in Central Dimmit County. So although this overall program remains in the pilot phase, we are applying our learnings and moving up the learning curve.
Now let's move over and talk about the Permian Basin, so please turn to Slide 17. We now have roughly 47,000 net acres over in Reeves County, where activities are really starting to pick up, not only by our company, but also industry. We exited the year with 1 rig drilling horizontal wells, and we now have 4 rigs dedicated to horizontal drilling. We're on pace to drill approximately 25 horizontal wells this year. And so far, we are extremely pleased with what we are seeing coming out of the [indiscernible] play.
This is a map of our Reeves County acreage position. In yellow are the leases where we have greater than 50% working interest and we operate. In the areas in light gray, we have less than 50% working interest, and we do not operate. The well locations in solid black are some of the offset horizontal operations by other operators, some in which we own a working interest in and some in which we do not, but all are applicable to the delineation of our acreage position. The wells in solid blue are the horizontal wells that Rosetta has completed to date, and I will go over those in a few minutes. The dotted lines in the background on both our operated and non-operated acreage are technically vetted inventory. I will also cover this inventory shortly, but the bottom line is that we are increasing our horizontal inventory well count significantly based on the continued successful delineation that is occurring by us and others in Reeves County.
As of today, we are counting inventory in 4 unique reservoirs. Starting from the shallowest over-pressured bench, they are the Third Bone Spring, the Wolfcamp A bench, the Wolfcamp B bench, and the Wolfcamp C bench. We plan to focus our 2014 plans on continually delineating these benches horizontally.
As of now, we have excluded any horizontal inventories from the lesser pressured First and Second Bone Spring and Avalon Shale packages higher in the column, as well as the Wolfcamp B interval at the base of the column, although we do like its pressure.
Now let's talk about the horizontal wells that have been recently completed on our acreage where we own an interest. You can see by the locations on this map that most of the activity by Rosetta and industry to date have been lateral links less than 5,000 feet. This will most likely change to much -- to drilling much longer laterals, as operators pool acreage, optimize their completion design and change field rules. With that said, let's go through activities on our area.
If you will look at the farthest western solid blue line in the middle of our leasehold, this is the previously announced Balmorhea 32-15 well. This well is a Wolfcamp A well that produced 737 BOEs per day for its 30-day average.
Now if you move south from that well, about 3 miles, you will see our Balmorhea Ranch 41-3 well. This well is also a Wolfcamp A bench well, and its 7-day rate was 987 BOEs per day. This one of our newest completions.
Directly offsetting that well to the north, the solid red line, is our Roy Bean well, which is our first Wolfcamp B bench well. This well has been drilled and completed, and it is just now currently flowing back, so it will be a 2Q update well.
Now let's go from that area east about 6 miles to the next set of solid blue lines. These are the Gaucho state wells. The well with the shorter lateral is the Gaucho 15-2 that was announced last quarter. The 7-day rate was 829 BOEs per day. The well with the longer lateral is the 15-1 well, which was an earlier well and had a longer lateral length. Notice that both the 7-day rate and the 30-day rates are about 50% higher on the longer lateral well, so we do consider well performance to be scalable with lateral length.
Now moving to the blue line on the eastern most side of the map takes you to our Sam Bass 15-2 well. This well is another Wolfcamp A bench well, and its 7-day rate was 692 BOEs. This is an unstabilized rate so far, and we are optimizing its flowback to determine its ultimate potential.
As you can see, the zip code in Reeves County is really starting to look attractive from a horizontal development standpoint. We now have horizontal well results that span across our acreage 11 miles from east to west and 8 miles from north to south. As you can see from the wells in red, that make up this year's program, at the conclusion of our 2014 program, we should have well results that encompass a significant portion of our acreage. Keep in mind that this is the lateral delineation, and that there are 4 unique benches vertically that each must also be delineated. But needless to say, we are pleased with the results so far by us and others.
So now please turn to Slide 18, and I will briefly update you on our horizontal inventory. Previously, our gross operated horizontal well inventory included 611 locations. We have now adjusted this number upwards as of today, and we sit at 994 gross operated well locations. If you include the gross non-operated well locations, the total number of remaining locations operated and non-operated is 1,176. Of this number, about half are associated with the Wolfcamp A bench, about 25% is associated with the Third Bone Spring and the remaining 25% is allocated between the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp C benches.
Our current inventory is being tallied on 5,000-foot laterals, but as I mentioned earlier, we believe well performance is scalable to lateral length. And once we go into development mode, get the field rules changed, look for us to maximize the lateral lengths and optimize the well economics.
We've had a great start to 2014, and I look forward to keeping you up-to-date on the results of our Delaware Basin horizontal program, as we continue to expand our activities.
As always, I appreciate your interest in our operations. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, John. Our goal this morning was to give you a detailed view of our 2014 plans for our horizontal activity in the Delaware Basin. Still early days for the program, but we're very pleased with the well results covering multiple zones in and around our acreage positions.
Our 2014 program is designed to gather maximum information as we delineate multiple resource opportunities. We also gave you our initial assessment of our Upper Eagle Ford spacing pilots. We have made great progress in both of our core areas, and we will continue to execute on our future growth plans in South Texas and the Permian Basin.
Before we open the call up for Q&A, as always, I'd like to thank Rosetta's technical and business support teams for the work that they perform on a daily basis. We are quickly approaching the halfway mark in 2014, and while we have accomplished much, we will keep up the established momentum and focus on execution at all levels.
I'll now turn the call back to the moderator so that we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gabriele Sorbara with Topeka Capital Markets.
Gabriele Sorbara - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
You mentioned an increased confidence in the delineation work from peers in Reeves County. Just wanted to see if I could get some additional color on what's giving you the confidence in the Third Bone Spring, the lower Wolfcamp zones, considering most of the wells have been completed in the Wolfcamp A zone?
John D. Clayton
Yes, this is John. It's a good question. So most of our inventory, about half of it is the Wolfcamp A zone because that's where a lot of our data is. But our technical guys have got sub-surface maps of all these intervals, and they use cutoffs to determine what calculates as pay. And as activity comes through it, if we have a well that confirms our cutoffs are either too high or too low, we make those adjustments. And then that changes the area of the maps in which we think offer us commercial inventory. All the data that we have so far for the most part is coming out of the Wolfcamp A, although keep in mind that we do have probably about 200 vertical locations in this area here that we've been doing some well testing on to understand Third Bone Spring's potential, along with Wolfcamp A potential. I'll comment a little bit on the B/C because one of the things that the acreage has in common, as you get lower in the Wolfcamp section, our water saturations start getting higher. Now areas are different, but as you get lower in the section, we do get higher water saturations in the lower areas. So although I think our inventory has the opportunity to increase even further maybe in the Third Bone, I think we're probably at the appropriate part in the B/C area right now because we've got some areas in that, that are mapped wet that don't go across our entire acreage position. But bottom line is we have cutoffs on our technical maps and every time we get a piece of the data, whether it's a test from a vertical well or an offset horizontal well, we then change the maps and recalculate pay and that gives us a broader area.
Gabriele Sorbara - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about frac spacing in those 2 Wolfcamp wells. It looks like it implies roughly 300-foot spacing. I think some of the better wells in the region have been sub-250-foot spacing. How should we think about spacing going forward?
John D. Clayton
That's another good question. We're spacing the ones we have today and these are 4,000-foot wells just based on field rules, and so forth, but we're pumping our 14 stages and spacing the stages about 275 feet between each stage. Now keep in mind, we're still in the learning stages over here in the Permian. We haven't fine-tuned it like we have in the Eagle Ford. But one of things that we've tested differently are we put 4 clusters between each of our stages. So although we're pumping 14 stages, we have 4 sets of perforations in each stage that is taking fluid and proppant. I think some of the offset wells that we're studying and looking into and you can see on this map, we've got a working interest on, I think, 7 of them right now. Some of the other operators are pumping more stages, but each stage has a fewer number of clusters per stage. And I just think it's something that we'll work out as industry. We'll modify the spacing between the stages, and then we'll also modify the number of clusters per each stage. Now I hope that answered your question, but we pump, right now, fewer stages, but we have higher density of perforations between each stage.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Irene Haas with Wunderlich Securities.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
Let's talk about the Upper Eagle Ford pilot. So you have #1 and #2 that looks like it's generating lower EUR, and then pilot #3 look pretty promising. What specifically is in the rock type that makes for a lower sort of productivity? And then really looking at it now, because you get to sort of drill 2 wells, probably off the same location, what kind of returns are we looking at even though the EUR might not be as it [indiscernible] as the lower Eagle Ford?
John D. Clayton
Irene, this is John. Yes, let me see if I can tackle all of those. So based on where our development plans were at the time, we chose to start our Eagle Ford -- Upper Eagle Ford pilots in Gates Ranch, so those were our first. We drilled -- if you look at the thickness that we're drilling there, it's a little thinner. So if you -- if I was going to compare and contrast Lower Eagle Ford rock with Upper, the Lower Eagle Ford is just a much higher quality rock. It's got a lot more porosity to it, it's got better matrix permeability to it, it fracs better. As you move into the Upper Eagle Ford, it doesn't have near the developed porosity in that rock. So what we need out of that Upper Eagle Ford is we need a CH [ph]. And so I think we have to have more H in the Upper Eagle Ford in order for us to start improving the commercial terms. So that would be my first comment. My second comment is what we're trying to figure out, early on we thought we would target the highest part of the Upper Eagle Ford as our targeted lateral entry point. As you know, and others know, these fracs, it's a lot easier to get them to grow up and we're sitting right below the chalk and we didn't think that was a bad idea. Once we move the target lower in the section, which is only one data point over in Dimmit County, it looks to us like we're probably getting a lot more height growth into that unstimulated rock volume that helps us with the commercial terms. That's why we moved back to Gates on the last pilot and started drilling the Upper Eagle Ford wells right above that interval that we don't think we're effectively stimulating yet. So it's a couple of things. We looking for more H, which the 2 areas we drilled at Gates are pretty thin. And then we're trying to get in contact with that H and we've changed our design to move a little lower in the section. Now if you move to the L&E that we have over in Central Dimmit, I think the biggest part is we're lower in the section that gives us more height growth above the well when we frac it, but the total H package of the Upper Eagle Ford there is a lot thicker than it is over in the South and East parts of Gates.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
So the conclusion is you probably still got work to do in the Gates Ranch area, but to some extent, you're limited by the thickness and -- but you are trying to frac the lower interval to see if it works better. Is that the way we should read it? And how should we look about when you would have the final answer for this sort of Upper Eagle Ford?
John D. Clayton
Yes, so I think what we've tested so far on the east side of Gates and the southern side of Gates, if we don't see anything different by moving that take point lower in the section right above that 150-foot threshold above the Buda, if we don't see any difference in well performance, we're swapping dollars with, I think, the investments where we have that 110- to 125-foot target at Gates. So look for us to test as we move north in Gates, we start getting another 50% more of rock, well, I think our thicknesses in the northern part that are unstimulated start approaching 190- or 200-feet thick. So that's our next move is to test in the Northern Gates where we have more H to apply to that lower porosity. I would also look for us to probably target lower Upper Eagle Ford wells in that section as opposed to the ones right below the chalk. And then Briscoe Ranch is our thickest, so far. It just didn't coincide with our development program to do that Upper Eagle Ford pilot test yet, but look for us to do a pilot now at Briscoe Ranch, where our thickness is of what we think is unstimulated approach is 260-feet thick. And so when you apply that thickness to the Lower porosities in the Upper Eagle Ford, you start getting some pretty good numbers to play with.

Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Say, Jim, for you or John, just wondering, when you tackle obviously, the multi-formations early [ph] this Permian and I think that inventory sheet says a lot to show how many locations you have on each. Just wondering when you tackle that, how you are all assuming well costs going forward? I mean, are you going to sort of go in on one pad and tackle that the A, and the B or the C or the Third Bone Spring? I'm just wondering from a cost basis, how you see this playing out because of that?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Neal, this is John. Our well cost, I think the last thing that we've done public on wells that didn't have a pilot well were in that $7.5 million to $8 million range, so that's kind of where we are now. But we are pumping -- or we are drilling single-well pads. If you go back to the Eagle Ford, our industry, we probably realize that 15% or 20% cost reduction when we went from a single well pad to a 3-well pad. You can look at our Permian map here and you can see some wells that are more tightly spaced. If you look kind of in the central area, you can see a 4-well spacing program and a 3-well. We've actually already drilled a 3-well, but that wasn't really to see what our cost savings were on multi-wells from a single pad as much as it is to start getting some data on well spacing. But I don't think, speaking for industry, that we would be too much out there if we said another 15% or 20% cost reduction once this play goes into full development mode and we start drilling 3, 6 and 8 wells from a single well pad because that really showed in the Eagle Ford as true synergies of increasing it.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then just one follow-up. Based on those locations, I see, obviously, over almost 360 locations for the A. How does that play out? I guess what I'm wondering for your 44,000, 45,000 acres there, as I move sort of from west to east, is it -- I mean, does it thin out a little bit? I'm just wondering again, I guess what I'm after is, why a few less locations on the B? And so why are you all assuming a few less B or C in [ph] Third Spring locations versus the Wolfcamp A there?
John D. Clayton
Yes, so as it was mentioned earlier, we've got a lot more data on the Wolfcamp A. Even if you calculate hydrocarbons in place on a vertical well and look at the strat column, you conclude pretty quickly that there is a lot of storage in the Wolfcamp A area. And I think that's why industry is targeting the A so much. So if everything was the same and you asked me what's the best rock, I think I would tell you that we're seeing some pretty good original hydrocarbons in place located and calculated in the A. But the Bone Springs, I don't believe is being drilled as much right now because we like to save acreage out here by drilling deeper sections. And I would rank the Bone Springs right behind the A. It's got over-pressured to it. It's below the transition zone when you go from the Second Bone Spring to the Third. That's where we start getting an increase in geo pressure. Then I'd move down to the B/C, which we don't have many B/C wells out here but it's complicated. It's a big thick package. If you take the 2 rocks or the 2 benches together and add them together, we're approaching about 500-feet thick. It's organic in nature, but it's very coarse. It drills slower, so the well cost drilling lower wells are going to be a little higher because it takes longer to drill that rock. But I think the most important thing on why we don't have a lot of B/C inventory out here is we're having a hard time understanding how we're going to stay out some of the wet sands. So a lot of our sub-surface maps, map that area down there to where there's a lot of wet sands, and unless you've got debris flows that will act as a frac barrier, we don't see a way to stay out of them in some of the areas and we haven't included them in the inventory.
James E. Craddock
Neal, I would just remind you and the other listeners that in addition to the horizontal wells traces that are on the map on Page 17, there are a large number of vertical wells that we've been drilling and they provide a lot of useful data. So we've got pretty good sub-surface well control by virtue as vertical well. And we do a lot of production logging, so we frac-ed all these different zones. We've got vertical wells producing in the B/C. We've got them producing in the Bone Springs in the Wolfcamp A. We're able to see the relative contribution from the vertical test. So that's really informing a lot of our early views of these zones. And now it's time to get in with horizontal wells to kind of firm this up. So we're very much in delineation mode, but we're not starting from scratch. We've got a lot of good data from the vertical well test.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
I appreciate the data from both plays. One thing I wanted to touch on real quick while we're still talking about the Permian, the location count for the horizontals, how does it impact your vertical well count? And/or, I guess, your plans moving forward from the delineation standpoint as we walk through the rest of this year and next year? How do you split capital between the 2? Did it change at all, given your expectation for more horizontals? Or are we sticking with what we've talked about in the past and just accelerating as we get into '15?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Brian, this is John. I know there is forward-looking statements on this call, but I'll tell you how we're kind of seeing it going forward. I believe that we will eliminate all of our vertical locations out here. I think it'll be sooner, rather than later. And they will be replaced with -- we're getting ready to go 5 rigs horizontal out here, and we should be able to keep our acreage position intact by doing nothing but horizontal delineation. So we will drill vertical wells, probably, through the remainder of this year, but I wouldn't be surprised if when we came out with our next year program, that we're able to hold this acreage intact with an accelerated horizontal program. So that's kind of how I would model it. With respect to the inventory on horizontal, so our vertical inventory, I'm hoping will go to 0. And then on the horizontal, although we are sitting on a number right now that's 1,100 and something, we're really basing that on the current field rules that we have in place. And we've partnered with all the operators in this area. I think we're all seeing the same type of data. And we've got an effort as a group to change the field rules that allow us to drill longer laterals and pump more stages and then make this rock more efficient as a contributor. And when we do that and increase the lateral lengths, you'll see our inventory well count go down, but the cost efficiencies and the economics as you know, will go up quite a bit. But that's not just an effort by Rosetta, but we're part of a group of the operators in Reeves County that are starting to push for less spacing from leased lines and that will allow us to drill longer laterals and get more frac stages in there.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. That's great color. And then, on the, I guess, on your condensate issue, that you mentioned moving the LLS diff just a little bit? Maybe you can touch on that a little bit more. Maybe more specifics on what happened in Q1 and/or what you're seeing for the remainder of the year at this point?
John E. Hagale
Yes, this is John Hagale. I would say there's 2 things going on with oil prices company-wide this year. I touched on both of them from March, but let me add a little color to it. As it relates to condensate, we're still seeing roughly the same differential that we've seen in the past. In fact, we're looking at some additional deals that would price condensate -- our condensate based off LLS going forward the next couple of years. And those things are still in the same range of what we've talked about before, which is $13 or $14 off LLS. So we really haven't seen much if any differential on the condensate spread from LLS from what we've seen in the past. What we did see on the lease this quarter, again, I'm still in Eagle Ford, we did see on the lease this quarter as we had some third party facilities issues that caused us have to truck some of those things off the lease and that was a much wider differential because you had to truck those things off, I think some of those were maybe even $20, but that's not something we foresee going forward. And then in the Permian, what happened, if you go back over the last year or so, the Permian differential has been $3.50, $4. I think at one point it was flat. But it's been hovering in that range. You had some refineries down and you had some pipeline capacity issues that had that differential go, again from LLS, probably $11, $12, $13 during the quarter. If you look at the forward curve, it's back to like $3.50. So part of what I was trying to say in my remarks is we've already got Q1 in there so that's going to impact the year. We're still trying to give you full year's guidance, so I widened it by about $1 for this year. That gives you a feel for where we are.

Our next question comes from the line of Will Green with Stephens.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
I wonder if we could start maybe on the Reeves County stuff? And talk about how you guys are reporting the 7-day IPs you guys give in the press release? Is this just simply waiting until the well is completely stabilized from a pressure standpoint? Are you guys still recovering more frac load at that point and potentially seeing higher 7-day rates post this? How should we think about that in the 7-day rates?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Will, this is Clayton. It's -- so, well, let me define what we call stabilize because we did list the Sam Bass as an unstabilized rate and that may me give me some time to at least define and clarify that. So we pump frac fluid on these wells like any other operator in any other resource play and then we start our flow back on it, and we start recovering load back. And we'll start getting gas breakthrough probably first and then we'll start getting a little oil breakthrough after that. And then as the frac load declines, as you know, our pressures go up, when we start getting less and less water out of the well and more hydrocarbons, which are lighter. And then we go into that entire well life and we pick the 7-day rate contiguous days that have the highest rate, and we report that as our 7-day stabilized rate. And what that has to have is it has to have a declining frac load coming back and it has to have a pressure that is stabilized and is not continuing to rise. And it may occur 20 or 30 days into the flowback of the well. It's not something that occurs in the first 7 to 10 days of it. And then we do the same thing with the -- excuse me, the 30-day rate. So it may be the contiguous or continuous 30 days over maybe a 45-day period or it's not the first 30 days. So that's kind of how we pick it. And what we want to do is we want to get that well into a stable condition where there aren't external influences, like the reason pressures are coming up is because frac fluid is going down, and we want to eliminate those unknowns to where we can then start seeing what's mother nature giving us and what she is actually going to produce. So let me visit a little bit about the Sam Bass here and we listed that as an unstabilized rate. Earlier, I talked about the B and the C as you get lower in the Wolfbone interval. It's got a lot of sands down there that are tight and they're course grain but they also include high water saturations. We completed the Sam Bass well, and I'll characterize it a little bit. It's furthest up dip of our easternmost well, so there's a nose that comes in from the east and then it dips down. And somewhere between that big lub [ph] well on the map, right after that, the rock dips down and flattens out as you move into the Tycoon area where we've get some interest in some of those wells in our Gaucho area that we operate. So that area, based on the way we have it, is a little more fractured. We completed the Sam Bass well, no different than we had done the rest of them. It was a mechanical success. The stages were pumped away as designed. When we started flowing it back, we started producing our load fluid just like normal. But then we noticed the chlorides of that load started coming up, which is more indicative of some of that water coming back is coming from the B and the C that's well below this. We knew that going into it that this is an area that's got more dip to it, more natural fractures and more prone to faulting. The 7-day rate on that was I think a little shy of 700 BOEs per day. What we then have done subsequent to that is we stopped completion op [ph] or flowback operations and we've run a jet pump in the hole. And we're just now getting that lined out. And we're going to move the fluid that not only is load fluid that's remaining, because we still have a little bit of that to cleanup. But then we're going to get ahead of whatever the B and C has given us as far as water. And then we're going to figure out what does the actual Wolfcamp A in that area produce if we're not getting contribution from the B/C water that we think that we probably in contact with. So that's why we reported it unstabilized. If we can figure out what the A hydrocarbons will give us, then we can design our fracs a little different and try to stay away from the B/C on that far, far Eastern side. So we knew getting into with that big lub [ph] well that there was a chance that we could get the B/C contribution to give us a little bit of produced water and that's what's happened on that well, and now we've got a jet pump in the hole.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
And so that may help kind of determine why the 7-day rate was lower on that one, as well as maybe the oil cut as well, right?
John D. Clayton
Yes. The -- the dip out here is fairly subtle when you look at big structural changes. But if you were to map it, you would see that, that far east side, right around the big lub [ph] well and our Sam Bass well has got the steepest dip of probably anything on the map by quite a bit actually. And what we're trying to do is figure out, is that higher gas rate a function of being a little higher up dip in the reservoir? Or are we just not getting the oil contribution and what's holding the oil back was it was also continuing to flow against a full column of water that was coming in from the B/C. So the 692 that we reported is an actual 7-day contiguous rate that we produced from that well. But then since then, we're trying to figure out what it will produce if it doesn't have the water contribution in the wellbore and that's what we're looking at, because later on maybe we can figure out how to not frac into the B/C or stay away from some of the more naturally fractured areas of the faulting. It's not a very big area. There's a nose that comes in and it only covers about maybe 3 or 4 sections in that area, but somewhat big lub [ph] in the Tycoon area, we don't have that anymore and that's what we're trying to figure out.

Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with RBC Capital Markets.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to get into the Eagle Ford production a little bit more here. If I recall, I think correctly from your last conference call, I think you guys said you had significant midstream downtime in the Eagle Ford in 4Q. I think it was kind of circa kind of 4,000 barrels a day. I guess you guys did allude to the fact that you had some issues, kind of selling condensate. This quarter as well. You had to truck some off the lease. But I'm trying to figure out if you guys had any other kind of significant production downtime in the first quarter in just the Eagle Ford as well? Just kind of looking at some of the data you provided, it looks like you brought 32 wells on production in the Eagle Ford in the first quarter. Kind of a record number. It sounds like a lot of those were in March, but just looking at your Eagle Ford production was up about 1,900 barrels a day between Q4 and Q1. So I'm just trying to understand some of the moving pieces that may have affected the quarter. I guess I would've thought that would've been up more, given the downtime but midstream you had in Q4. Maybe you guys could just kind of talk to that a little bit more?
John D. Clayton
You bet. This is John again. We actually had a pretty good run for the first quarter, so -- as far as operational hiccups and so forth, we really didn't have anything that wasn't out of the ordinary. So it was actually a pretty smooth quarter as far as implementation and operations. Here's a few points I would make though to maybe better understand how we planned out the year, and so forth. We front end loaded our capital program coming into 2014, really for a couple of reasons. The primary reason was if you were to look at, and I think one -- maybe one of our slides in the deck that's out there, if not it's on our investment deck. If you were to look at Gates Ranch lease map, we turned the corner from our second row to our third row going into 2014. And I think what's important about that is to understand, and I know that there's a lot of clarity in discussion on this, but I'll go ahead and repeat it, but to understand how when we turn that row, when we shut in wells what occurs. And we averaged in the first quarter 26 wells that were shut in during the quarter. And then you have to ask yourself, âOkay, well, where were those wells and what type of wells were those?" One, why was the well count so high? Why the well count was so high that we shut in? This is the first time we started completing wells on the third row. So when we shut in the same number of feet of wells, let's say, 2,000 or 3,000 feet of wellbores, we are now shutting in twice the number of well counts because we are shutting in now row 2 wells, whereas if you go back just last quarter when we would shut in wells on Row 2, we were shutting in the well row -- excuse me, the wells on Row 1 that were spaced 850 feet apart. So we're shutting in twice as many wells to shut in the same geographic area. So that's one thing I would point out. And we saw that and knew that coming into 2014, so we went ahead and front-end loaded some of our capital program and we focused on areas outside of Gates. We only completed 9 wells at Gates Ranch, so one could actually say, if you maybe look at our plans, which I think is about 45 wells at Gates Ranch, we're actually lagging, bringing on completions at Gates Ranch by only completing 9 in the first quarter. Then if you look at what we did bring on, Tom Hanks was one of the areas that we moved rigs into, drilled and completed. And I think in the first quarter, if my memory serves me right, we brought on 11 wells at Tom Hanks. But not all wells are created equal. Now Tom Hanks is a much oilier area. It's got a 50% after tax return. We really love it. But if you look at our type curves at Tom Hanks, those wells come on at half of what at Gates Ranch well comes on at. So you would have to do twice the number of wells at Tom Hanks as you would have to do at Gates. So there's so many moving parts to this stuff, but we didn't -- I guess to answer your question quickly, there wasn't any operational hiccups in the first quarter. We actually like the way it came on. And for the first half of the year, if you look at us now going down Row 3, for the first half of this year, we're going to be shutting in Row 2 wells. And those are the wells that if you were to look at their type curve and see when we completed them, it was just a few months ago that some of them were brought on. So we're shutting them in when they're producing at the early part of the type curves. And so we saw that coming, and that was one of the reasons we accelerated capital. But that's a long-winded answer, but it's kind of how we looked at the development of this. And the other side of that, as we move from east to west on Row 3, the second half of the year when we shut in wells on Row 2, those wells will be 12 months down the type curve and we'll be shutting in much lower rates on for every well we shut in. And I hope you understood that because it was a long-winded answer, but I think it's important to understand kind of what we did.
