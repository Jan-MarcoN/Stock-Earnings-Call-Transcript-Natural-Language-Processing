Good morning and welcome to Starwood Hotels & Resorts Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Sylvia, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Adam Aron, our CEO on an interim basis; and Tom Mangas, our CFO and Executive Vice President.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Starwood's annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com.
With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Adam for his comments.
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Stephen. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Starwood's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Let's start with a brief overview of our quarterly results, expectations for the third quarter and full-year 2015, than a brief discussion of four key topics that have been central to our concerted efforts to improve Starwood's performance as hotel operator and franchisor, as well as to accelerate the pace of our growth. After that, Tom Mangas, our Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our financials in significantly greater detail. We then will open up the call to taking your questions.
Starting with our second quarter 2015 results, our adjusted EBITDA was $311 million, and EPS before special items was $0.84 per share, both ahead of our expectations. This earnings performance was achieved in the face of macroeconomic headwinds that drove our constant dollar worldwide system-wide REVPAR and core fees growth below our guidance ranges. Even so, we are making progress on a number of fronts, including increasing our market share in the quarter across seven of our nine brands with comparable year-over-year results and improving the trajectory of the company's net rooms growth for 2016 and beyond. In short, we believe that the team at Starwood has been managing our business tightly with a renewed focus on our hotel owners, our hotel guests, and our own bottom line, for the balance of 2015, we remain confident and optimistic. Tom will talk to that in much greater detail.
Now let's provide you with an update on what is getting noticed and gaining traction. Our efforts to, one, improve our effectiveness, including reducing our costs; two, reinvigorate our brands and strengthen their appeal; three, accelerate the pace of Starwood's hotel footprint growth; and four, deliver on our asset-light strategy.
First, Starwood's management team is focused on effectiveness and on reducing our costs. In the second quarter, we took action to fully implement the reorganization plan that we announced on our April earnings call. The changes have resulted in a more streamlined organizational structure and operational policies that are improving the way we do business and increasing our speed of execution. As a company, we believe we are more responsive and are making decisions faster. The feedback from our hotel owners is that they see greater accessibility of our management and a willingness to roll up our sleeves and work together on the hard issues. Overall, the changes we have made will reduce our SG&A expense by $25 million in run rate annual savings, making sure that we are a lean and nimble organization will remain a key focus of the company as we move ahead.
Second, at the same time, significant work has also been started on strengthening our brands. We started with the launch on April 16 of our new Tribute Portfolio Collection brand with the Royal Palm of Miami South Beach, and we are pleased to report on this call that just yesterday our development group signed the first Tribute Portfolio Hotel in Europe, planting the Tribute Portfolio flag in central London.
Tribute was followed by the announcement on June 1 of the Sheraton 2020 plan, on which implementation has already begun. The new brand identity, look and feel for Sheraton are complete, and it is now being rolled out to our hotels around the world. Additionally, earlier this month, we unveiled a wholly-new and more sophisticated Sheraton.com website, importantly containing a new reservations display format that we believe highlights our hotels much better and sells much harder.
In August, we will announce the first of the newly-named Sheraton Grand hotels that will allow Starwood to commence showcasing the best-in-class Sheraton hotels and resorts throughout the world. Beginning this fall, you'll see a broad-based multi-national advertising campaign that should put Sheraton front-of-mind for the traveling consumer. And at our Sheraton properties, you'll see us calling on the passion of our hotel associates to shine through with a renewed focus on service, especially as that is accompanied with real innovations in the Sheraton guest experience.
The reinvigoration of our brands does not stop with Sheraton. We're also taking a renewed approach to increasing our marketing and sales efforts in support of The Luxury Collection brand. With a footprint of 100 luxurious hotels open by year-end, The Luxury Collection is adding properties at an impressive clip.
Hotel owners have been bringing some engaging properties to The Luxury Collection, whether it's conversion by Chicago's Miracle Mile joining The Luxury Collection this autumn, or the Sunset Key Cottages, set amidst 27 lush acres on an island just 500 yards from Key West, and just this month ranked by Travel + Leisure Magazine as the single best resort in the Continental United States, or the new unique Hotel Augustine in Prague, new for The Luxury Collection, located in a former monastery that dates back to the 13th century. Hotel owners believe in The Luxury Collection brand and are voting with their wallets, spending liberally across Europe and North America on renovations and improvements.
Turning to the select service category, determined action has caused more than 40% of Starwood's entire pipeline to come from our limited service hotels in the upscale market segment. Measured by number of hotels, Four Points now has the largest pipeline of hotels coming into our system of all 10 of Starwood's brands, with Aloft being the second-largest brand in our pipeline. And speaking of Aloft, we are continuing our work to raise awareness of its progress. We reached an important milestone for the Aloft brand this year.
In the franchise disclosure documents that were published earlier this spring, Aloft's U.S. REVPAR increased by 13% versus the prior year and increased by 24% versus two years back. That trend of increasing Aloft REVPAR has continued well into 2015. Aloft REVPAR was up 10% in the second quarter year-over-year. Added to this improved competitive revenue performance, we have also taken actions that will reduce Aloft's cost per key to build, making new builds and conversions more likely. Indeed, Aloft's room count is now 12% larger than just a year ago. And in the first half of 2015, Starwood signed as many deals for Aloft as were done for Aloft in all of full-year 2014.
Which brings us to our third topic, accelerating the pace of Starwood's growth. We are serious about driving our organic growth. We have sped-up decision making by implementing simplified processes that empower our executives to approve straightforward deals at the regional and divisional levels. We also now have resources in place to support more complex deal structures and are willing where warranted to creatively use our balance sheet to get deals over the finish line.
Our development organization had a strong quarter in signing up more properties to join the Starwood system, April to June of 2015. Although we acknowledge that we still have work ahead of us to improve that performance even further. In the second quarter, Starwood opened 21 hotels with approximately 4,000 rooms, an increase of 5% from the second quarter last year. But demonstrating that we are, in fact, succeeding in efforts to accelerate growth, we signed fully 64 deals for new hotels in the quarter, representing 14,400 rooms, a nearly 70% increase versus signings in the second quarter of 2014. We're also heartened that in the quarter, 15 of these 64 deals were conversions from other hotel brands. That's almost double the conversion number from the second quarter of last year. And these hotels will enter our system sooner than hotels that would need to be constructed anew from the ground up. It now looks to us that we can expect net rooms growth for Starwood in calendar year 2016 and beyond to be back up to a level of 4% to 5%.
And fourth, we're also making significant progress in delivering on our asset-light strategy goals. The sale of The Gritti Palace in Venice, as you know, came at a price of $1.4 million per key. The Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona also sold, as you know, for $400 million, brought Starwood the single highest price we have ever achieved in selling a hotel.
In total, we have sold $566 million of hotel assets so far in 2015. As such, we remain confident that we will achieve our $800 million disposition goal for full-year 2015. And of course, the $200 million to $250 million in value of hotels contributed to the SVO timeshare spinoff, which Tom Mangas will talk to in a moment, is over and above that $800 million target.
Before turning the call over to Tom, we need to address two more topics. Many of you are eager to learn where the board of directors is in both its review of strategic and financial alternatives for Starwood and the status of the search for a permanent CEO successor to lead Starwood. Both processes are very much and well underway. But at this point, we have nothing specific to report and have said previously that we would not be commenting on either topic midstream. It goes without saying that we will share news with you on these two important subjects as soon as there is news that we can share. What we can say now is that looking at Starwood overall, we're making progress in running our business better and accelerating our growth. We are focused on taking the concrete actions necessary to create and to capture the near-term opportunities that we see before us.
With that, here's Tom Mangas.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Adam. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the call. For my prepared remarks, I'll review the results for the second quarter of 2015, our guidance for the third quarter and full year, and give you a brief update on the status of the spinoff of our vacation ownership business. In short, we are pleased with our overall performance, despite a weaker-than-expected international REVPAR environment, as strong operations and actions on cost allowed us to exceed our earnings guidance. At the same time, our hotel teams grew worldwide share in the quarter in all three of our divisions.
In the second quarter, worldwide system-wide constant dollar REVPAR was up 4.1% but decreased 0.7% when accounting for the impact of foreign exchange. We enjoyed share gains across five of our six regions. Our core management and franchise fees were down 1% versus 2014, driven by unfavorable exchange rates. Management fees, franchise fees and other income decreased 1.5% versus last year, in line with our expectations, and again, impacted by significant foreign exchange and a sizable termination fee in the prior year.
Worldwide occupancy at our hotels was up 140 basis points to 72.2%, a record for the second quarter. The standout performer among our brands was again Aloft, which grew constant dollar REVPAR by 10%. As Adam noted, we are seeing great traction with the brand, both in terms of the performance of open hotels and our signings pace for new Aloft hotels. Once again, our owned and leased hotels outperformed, thanks to the quality of our assets, our teams and our locations in key resorts and urban destinations. Worldwide constant dollar REVPAR for our owned hotels increased approximately 7%, and in North America our owned hotels grew REVPAR by nearly 9%. That strong growth and great flow-through allowed us to increase owned margins in North America by 150 basis points.
At our vacation ownership and residential business, earnings came in at $44 million, at the high end of our expectations. We benefited in the quarter from the timing of deferred revenues, also from strong operations at our resorts. The number of contracts signed for vacation intervals was up 1.8% in the quarter, but because of the mix of inventory sold, the average price per vacation ownership unit sold decreased, resulting in originated sales of vacation ownership intervals flat to last year.
As you know, we filed the Form 10 for Vistana Signature Experiences, Incorporated, with the SEC in June and remain on track with our current plans to complete the spinoff in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect to continue to file updates to Form 10, including additional details around the capital structure and pro forma financial statements, as we finalize the details regarding the spinoff, with an initial amendment to be filed with the SEC in the ordinary course within the next few weeks.
As Adam noted, we moved quickly and deliberately to implement a cost savings program we outlined in April, and we were able to complete much of that work in the second quarter. As a result, SG&A expenses were down 2.9% versus last year. This was a lower level than the 3% to 5% increase for the second quarter that we had discussed in our last earnings call. For 2015, we are now targeting SG&A to be lower than 2014 by 2% to 4%. But the full impact of the program will still result in run rate P&L savings of approximately $25 million. In our system funds, the restructuring plan resulted in annual savings of $60 million, at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Those funds will be redeployed to activities and programs, including marketing and advertising to drive growth.
Restructuring and other special charges in the second quarter totaled $23 million before tax and included $10 million related to the planned spinoff transaction, $12 million related to our restructuring program, a $6 million charge for technology-related costs and expenses that we no longer deem recoverable, and a reversal of $6 million related to favorable resolution of exposures from prior disposition and a prior dispute with a foreign taxing authority. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges the next several quarters, including a write-down related to the disposition of our airplane, currently mothballed. Total charges with the restructuring program continue to project to $30 million to $35 million, as we guided last quarter.
I'm going to turn now to the topline trends around the world we saw in the second quarter and how those play into to our outlook for the third quarter and full year of 2015. Starting with North America, system-wide constant dollar REVPAR grew 5.3% with rate up 4.2% in constant dollars, and occupancy up 80 basis points to a record 78.3%. REVPAR in the U.S. was up 5.5%. Bright spots included San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Seattle and San Diego, all of which had double-digit REVPAR increases.
On the other hand, low oil prices had a negative impact on business in Houston and in certain markets in Western Canada. In New York, which continues to suffer from an oversupply situation, REVPAR at our hotels was down 0.7%, which was an 80 basis point drag on our overall North America REVPAR growth. Nevertheless, our REVPAR performance was better than the industry average, and our hotels gained share by roughly 130 basis points in New York City.
The strength of the U.S. dollar appears to be having some impact on inbound travel to the U.S. Looking at our base of SPG numbers, room nights from international guests remained relatively flat to last year, while average daily rates for most international SPG guests traveling to the U.S. are higher than last year. They lag the growth we're seeing from domestic SPG members. In certain gateway cities like New York, Boston, and Miami, we have seen both lower volumes of room nights and ADRs from international travelers from a range of source markets.
In New York in particular, international room nights from SPG members were down 200 basis points. Transient revenue in North America was over 6% in constant dollars, driven mostly by rate. Group revenue was up 1.4% versus last year in constant dollars, with higher rates offsetting lower volume. Group growth was driven by continued decline in group size and demand in some of our heavily weighted markets, such as New York City.
In addition, several of our key group hotels are undergoing phased renovations. We expected them to be weak throughout the second quarter and that will continue to a lesser extent in the third quarter. Group pace for the full year remains in the mid-single digits. For the third quarter in North America, we expect to see similar trends as in the second quarter. We're expecting weak growth from international travel to gateway cities in U.S. to likely persist, and this year, the shift of Labor Day to September 7 and the impact of both Jewish holidays falling in September will restrain REVPAR growth versus last year. That said, July is off to a strong start and we are protecting a stronger fourth quarter which should result in an overall 5% to 7% REVPAR growth rate in the second half.
Now turning to Latin America; constant dollar REVPAR declined 3.2% in that region. REVPAR growth was negatively impacted by the difficult comparable results due to last year's World Cup in Brazil. However, the weakness in the Brazilian economy was more significant than we had expected. Excluding Brazil, REVPAR in Latin America was up 6.2%. Importantly, RPI in the region was up over 250 basis points. Our hotels in Mexico continued their strong performance with REVPAR gains of over 10%, ahead of our expectations and REVPAR growth at our resorts up over 18%. While the Argentine economy is not showing signs of any improvement, our hotels in Argentina are performing well with double-digit REVPAR growth versus last year.
As we head into the off-season for resorts in Mexico and lead up to elections in Argentina this fall, we expect third quarter REVPAR growth in Latin America to be soft, pulled down by Brazil still facing tough comparables from the end of last year's World Cup, on top of the country's continued economic weakness.
Second quarter performance in Europe was in line with our expectations with constant dollar REVPAR at our hotels up over 6%. The Europe on-sale effect played out much as we expected with volumes of U.S. travelers to Western Europe up nearly 20% second quarter. Chinese volumes were also up nearly 20%. While volume of travelers from the Middle East were up in certain markets during the quarter, the shift of Ramadan into the last weeks of the second quarter kept the impact in check.
Looking ahead, we expect REVPAR growth in Europe to be slightly lower than this quarter. We continue to expect to see strong demand from U.S. as well as from the Middle East following Ramadan. However, the impact of the economic situation in Greece as well as the weaker trade fair calendar in Germany has likely offset that benefit.
REVPAR growth at our hotels in the Middle East and Africa was down 4% in constant dollars in the second quarter, below our expectations, thanks to the one two three punch of a weaker euro driving down business from Europe, the continued lack of Russian travelers to resort destinations in Egypt and the Middle East, and the impact of low oil prices in resource-rich markets. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to see REVPAR growth above the high end of our worldwide guidance range, thanks to the shift in dates in Ramadan and the softer prior-year comparison in Africa. However, these markets remain volatile.
REVPAR in our hotels in Greater China was down 0.3% and was pulled down by the lower travel volumes to Macau and on weaker business travel to Hong Kong than we expected. Despite the market softness, our REVPAR index grew 130 basis points. For our hotels in Mainland China, REVPAR was up 4.2%, driven by occupancy growth of 370 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect to see similar performance in the third quarter.
Last, for Asia-Pacific, excluding China, REVPAR was up 7.5%, in line with our expectations, driven by significant gains in Thailand, which is seeing business return in the aftermath of last year's coup, as well as good performance at our hotels in Japan and India. For the third quarter, we expect to see similar performance in that region.
Based on this outlook, we expect system-wide constant dollar REVPAR for the third quarter to be up 4% to 6%, 550 basis points lower in actual dollars, which will result in core fee growth of 1% to 3% in actual dollars. Total fees will be up 2% to 4%. Our adjusted EBITDA range for the third quarter is $285 million to $295 million, and we expect earnings per share before special items to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.73. For the full year, we are now expecting system-wide constant dollar REVPAR to be up 4% to 6%, 400 basis points lower in actual dollars.
We project 2015 net rooms growth to be in the range of 2% to 3%, consistent with our year-to-date performance. We expect core fees to be up 6% to 8% in constant dollars or up 2% to 4% for the full year in actual dollars, and total fees will be roughly flat. We are increasing our REVPAR range for our owned and leased hotels to 5% to 7%, an margin improvement of 50 basis points to 100 basis points versus prior year.
Earnings from owned and leased hotels will be lower by approximately $17 million versus previous guidance, due to the asset sales completed to-date, which after the management fees and gain amortization reduces full-year total EBITDA by $10 million. We expect full-year earnings from our vacation ownership business to be between $155 million and $165 million. As I mentioned earlier, we expect SG&A to decrease 2% to 4% versus 2014.
With those building blocks, we are maintaining our full-year guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA, except for the impact of our asset sales and now projecting $1.175 billion to $1.2 billion. This translates to an adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 to $3.03. We are taking our guidance range for cash flow from operations, including $160 million spent on the vacation ownership inventory, up to $740 million to $840 million, which is up $50 million from our last guidance, reflecting this year's stronger performance at the vacation ownership business, as well as higher cash distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures. Please note that we have changed the basis of presentations of this metric in our full-year outlook versus last quarter, and it is now net of the vacation ownership inventory spend. We are maintaining our full-year guidance of $200 million for maintenance CapEx and $200 million for in-flight projects in development.
Finally, on return of capital, we repurchased 1.2 million shares in the second quarter for a total cost of $105 million and paid a dividend of $0.375 per share or approximately $64 million in total. Year-to-date, we have returned $228 million through repurchases and $128 million through dividends for a total return of $356 million. We expect to complete total share repurchases of $350 million in 2015 at the high end of the $300 million to $350 million range we provided last quarter.
In summary, we are executing well in tougher market conditions across most parts of the world. I'm confident the actions we are taking to both manage our costs and accelerator our growth can create strong momentum that can be carried into 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Stephen.

Thank you, Tom. We'd like to now open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourself to one question at a time, and then we'll take any follow-ups that you may have as time permits.

Your first question comes from Ryan Meliker from Canaccord Genuity.
Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, guys. I just had a couple of questions. I don't know what you can respond to and what you can't, but I think the first one with regards to the strategic review and the CEO search, I respect the fact that you guys won't comment on how things are going, but can you give us some color on any timeline where you expect you might be able to start giving us an update? Or is there any timeline that the board has in mind in terms of when they would like to have things ticked and tied away?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
That's â first of all, hello and thanks for the question. If I answer the question directly, then I'm doing exactly what you said in the preamble that I shouldn't do and couldn't do, which is comment on the strategic review process. I can confirm we're very much in it. In terms of timing, back on the April 29 call, when it was announced, Bruce Duncan, our Chairman, was on that call. You'll recall that he said that we would take the time we need to do this thoroughly. And really, nothing has changed since then. So it's very much underway. More than that, I'm afraid I can't share.

Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Tom, maybe you could just give us â I think you alluded to it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but anything we should be aware of in terms of kind of the final timing for the timeshare spin? Is that still on track to be completed by the end of the year and where does that sit right now?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Great. Thank you, Shaun, for the question. Yes, the timeshare spin remains very much on track. Our current plan is to continue to update the Form 10 as we receive comments from the SEC. You should expect an update in the normal course in the next few weeks and we'll continue to be revealing additional data on the business as we get closer to the spin. So we're very pleased with the team's progress there and understanding what it takes to run the business as a separate business, and continue to believe that having this business be separate from Starwood is â the shareholder maximizing value proposition that we believed it was initially.

Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thank you. You touched on this in your opening remarks, I think, but given commentary from one of your competitors this morning, could you talk a little bit more in depth about some of the things that you're doing that's different from maybe how Starwood approached this in the past in order to drive unit growth, which clearly you're seeing a marked step-up in.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. We also saw those remarks as well. I can tell you that what we're doing in terms of deal terms and economics are quite consistent with past practice over many years at Starwood. What we are doing is turning up the burners here and working harder, working smarter, working faster. We're talking to more owners, there's considerably more outreach to the hotel ownership community than before. We're â we've made it possible that we can approve a deal in a matter of weeks that might have taken months and months and months previously, and that all adds up. Plus, I also think that there is appeal in some of our brands. Look that 40% of our pipeline is now in select serve and that the two largest brands in our pipeline are Four Points and Aloft, that's not what you might have expected from Starwood previously.
So, I'd also say that the Sheraton 2020 plan has raised a lot of eyebrows about Starwood's being serious, about supporting Sheraton, which after all is 40% of our company. We mentioned earlier on the call that there's so much appeal in The Luxury Collection as a brand, we're getting one magnificent property after another handed to us. One just opened in Kyoto, one just opened in Prague, and it goes on and on and on. We're gaining traction with St. Regis. It looks as if it's again a darling amongst hotel developers. We announced St. Regis in the quarter, we announced the St. Regis in Mumbai, a St. Regis in Moscow, a St. Regis in the Maldives. So I would think I would answer your question just by saying we're doing it better, that's what we're supposed to do, and we're getting results accordingly

Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Adam, you said in your prepared remarks that you've increased market share in seven of your nine brands. I was hoping you could elaborate on that comment and maybe just give us some specifics around the brands that are improving? Wondering if you're above 100% REVPAR in those brands and who you think you're gaining share from? Thanks.
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Felicia. Always nice to talk to you. We said seven of the nine brands, I can't contain myself because we do have 10 brands. So we said seven of our nine brands with comparable results. Technically I guess the Tribute Portfolio improved its share from nothing to whatever share we have in Tribute now. The two brands on which we did not gain market share were Sheraton and Four Points. However, the lack of share gain was very modest, in the tenths of points, whereas the gain in share â and by market share we're using RPI as the proxy for market share â grew as much as 7.5% for one of our brands. The St. Regis brand grew 3.9%. Four of our brands â Aloft grew 2.6% in RPI. And these are points, not percent, I should be clear. And the other four brands are hovering around 100 basis points up.
I've no idea who we're taking the share from. It's a very big, diverse, fragmented hotel industry throughout the world, but I will say specifically on Aloft, where we're so pleased by what's happened with Aloft, REVPAR has gone up so much over the past two years, I said up 24%, talked about REVPAR up in the quarter up 10%. If you also look at Aloft's REVPAR, you go back into the FDDs, Aloft's REVPAR has climbed â the REVPAR index has climbed mightily in the past 24 months. Seven of our nine brands with comparable results are all over 100% of REVPAR index.

Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.
Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi. Could you just talk a little bit about the benefits and give us a little bit more color of some of these restructuring, because the way I'm looking at it, it looks like you spent about $54 million on restructuring costs in the last two quarters. But did I hear correctly that that will translate into $25 million of annualized savings? How should we be thinking about this, and will there be more restructuring costs over the next couple of quarters?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
All right. Thank you, Steven. I think you're capturing all the special charges we've been taking, which included some CEO severance costs and other things in the first quarter. The program that we've been specifically talking about, we're targeting overall to have $30 million to $35 million as part of our cost-out program. That $30 million to $35 million delivers both the $25 million in run rate SG&A savings, which you're starting to see in significant way in the second quarter and in the full-year guidance, you'll have a stub effect in 2016, and also enabling the redeployment of now $60 million of run rate savings in our centralized funds that because they're in our breakeven funds, we need to deploy them back to drive growth, and we've found, we think, better ways to drive growth, like more traditional forms of advertising whether through digital or traditional promotions to drive consumer intent back into our brands.
And again, we felt like over time we had built up some programs or activities or infrastructure in our centralized funds that weren't getting as effective utilization as we thought we could get from other forms and took some restructuring. So I wouldn't be reaching back into the first quarter on that because I do think as you go back into the first quarter, you are seeing things that are a bit outside of our restructuring program.

Hello. I'm trying to get a sense of how long it's going to take Starwood to get very, very close to 100% fee-driven business? Once it spins off its timeshare, you'll still have about $300 million of owned operating profit. What is a reasonable expectation for us to see that dwindle down to a much smaller number?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Harry. So I think you see a substantial step up with the vacation ownership spin. I'm expecting, by the end of the year if we are successful and we're confident, we're going to be successful in disposing our $800 million of assets â we've already done $566 million of disposals in the current year â that we're going to clip through that original 80% goal that we set. Of course that goal was set in the absence of the SVO spin idea. And we're going to continue to plow forward on the remaining $1.2 billion that we've outlined as part of our overall program to dispose $3 billion of assets by 2016, and if we can do better, we will.
And so we haven't provided any new timeline there, but I think between the SVO spin and the success against that disposition, we make substantial progress to 100%. And I think the â our intent is to be an asset light, but it wasn't an asset-zero objective. And that was â we may still find an opportunity here and there that we think is important to plant a flag in a key market, and we'll deploy capital to do that, which I think may provide a â it strategically may be providing a bit of a barrier to be at zero. But our intent is to be very asset light and continue to make as much progress as we can, while delivering on the best footprint growth for our consumers that we can.

Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. How are you? So there was an FT article out this morning suggesting that you had been in discussions with a few companies about potential combinations. IHG just put out a press release saying that you are not in discussions with them. I guess are you in conversations with anyone around the potential of combining? Thanks.
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Well, you know I can't answer that question, because we've said we're not going to comment on the strategic review midstream. But it's also no secret that we have a strategic alternative review process in place. You're going to see lots of information in the press. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.

Your next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. Just looking at your share repurchase in the quarter, it was only a little over $100 million, but your asset sales proceeds were over $500 million, and you historically talked about waiting until assets were sold, and then using that for repurchase. So I wonder if you could comment on kind of why you didn't do that with the proceeds and is that part of keeping your powder dry for something that you might want to do on the transaction front?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, Robin, thanks for the question, and I'm glad you asked it. So a couple of points, we've tried to be pretty consistent with our guidance on the year. We set both guidance points at the beginning, both on our expectation to dispose $800 million in assets and to do $300 million to $350 million of share repurchases and I was pleased in this quarter that we were able to confirm the high end of the repurchase range for the year. But that share repurchase program for the year was dependent on selling the $800 million in assets, so the asset sales that we achieved in the second quarter were part of the $800 million program. We were pleased to be able to get them done in a significant portion in the first half of the year and be ahead of kind of the pacing we had last year.
But as you can imagine, we are trying to make sure that we can be consistent and deliver that $350 million repurchase program and given kind of all the activity that's going on over here that we've had several questions on, whether it's CEO search and strategic alternatives, you can imagine that the management and the board, at times, may become in possession of non-disclosed material public information that would preclude us from going into the open market. So we've tried to set up a more programmatic effort to ensure we get to the goal line on $300 million and $350 million and I'll just remind you the building blocks that is essential to that $350 million objective for share repurchases presumes the SVO spin, which reduces our overall debt capacity by $400 million, which comes, as we said in the fourth quarter. So I think you see when we execute that plan and dispose the $800 million, we hit it on the nail, our leverage targets, the high-end by the end of the fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello, everyone. A question for you all. Do you think the board's strategic review and whatever that means is an impediment for signing new contracts? What are you hearing from the owner and development community, and are you hearing that at all from your folks internally?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joe. I'm kind of amazed how well we're doing in light of the uncertainty that is around the business, because of the strategic review and CEO succession. We don't even have â we felt no pain because of those issues sitting above the business. It's not to say that it doesn't come up in the course of a conversation, but we've been able to dispatch it handily, and all you have to do is look at the numbers yourself. The proof's in the pudding. We announced the strategic review on April 29, one month into the second quarter. By definition, the CEO search was announced on February 17, before the start of the second quarter, we signed 64 hotel deals, up almost 70% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2015.
So we are seeing real results. On an earlier question, I tried to explain why, and the simple answer to your question is, it's pedal-to-the-metal here at Starwood, and we're seeing success and development activity, and we're not feeling any pain because either the strategic alternative review process or the CEO search process is underway. As I said before, it's not like it doesn't come up in conversation, but we seem to be able to dispatch it quite readily. I do think the fact that there has been so much activity here, whether it's in the support of one brand or another brand, whether it's the cost effort, whether it's the hotel sale activities. We're giving the sense that Starwood is determined to run itself well day-to-day, and I think people are sensing that and feeling that.

Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I had a two part question. Could you guys comment a little bit about how the landscape for deals, and obviously you got two done in the quarter in the U.S. and one internationally, but I'm focusing more on the international front. How that landscape and/or dialogue around asset sales has changed as of late, and then if you could provide some color on how much leeway the current management team has to execute what I would call may be some larger-scale deals given the current search as well as the strategic review?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Well, on the first question, the global hotel market is still frothy and robust. And we are seeing plenty of interest in the variety of properties that we currently have hired brokers and are out to market with. Interest remains strong. I don't see any change, positively or negatively, in the interest of hotel buyers to acquire hotels. And that's true whether you're talking about North American buyers.
We sold The Phoenician to Host, as you know, or international buyers, we sold the Gritti Palace to Middle Eastern interests. With respect to your second question, I just need you to clarify a little bit, when you say what leeway we have to approach larger deals, what were you referring to? We're talking about hotels, individual hotel dispositions? As like a package of hotels? Was that the thrust of your question? Maybe you can't chime in. I'll assume that's what it was and say, yeah, we think that we have complete leeway to sell hotels one-off, a package of two, a package of three, a larger package if we so choose. We're quite active in talking about a variety of the owned hotels that are still in our stable. And as we've said before, quite confident, we're more than two-thirds of the way to $800 million, sitting by June 30, and we're very confident we'll get there at the end of the year.

Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good afternoon, guys. Adam, just a question concerning expanding distribution. Can you tell me in your mind what Starwood looks like when you feel you've achieved that ideal distribution or mix? And as a follow-up, I guess, I'm curious, what do you think the best avenue is to reaching that point? Is it continuing to ramp as you're doing now, sort of onesy-twosy, or do you feel the brand acquisition gets you there more cost-effectively?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Well, when I thought you were talking about distribution, I thought you were talking about distribution channels that we're using to filling the hotels, but the second half of your question seemed to go in a different place. So, I'll answer the question as I heard it, which is, the distribution system that drives the booking â the various booking channels, that drive revenue growth for hotels, if that â we'll stay on that part of the thrust of your question, and I think I can guess the other part, we'll go there in a minute.
The ideal distribution system from the eyes of any seller of a product is that your commission rate is about 1% and your occupancy of the hotels is about 100%. That would be ideal, it's not practical. And so, we are actively embracing a whole wide array of various distribution channels from our own internal distribution channels, our own websites, our own mobile apps. But we are â those obviously are the most cost-effective for us. We're helping to drive as much traffic to our own websites and our own smartphone apps as we possibly can, adding in functionality to our apps to give them greater consumer appeal. Our websites and apps have been somewhat transformed over the last six months to make them more functional, to make them more appeal, accordingly.
If by what you were talking about was distribution is do we need to play in the upscale or upper midscale segments of the travel â of the hotel industry, to be more effective up and down the ladder, that is one of the single largest issues that is now being discussed within Starwood and within our board of directors. It's part of the strategic review. We do have three players in the what Smith Travel Research calls the upscale segment, that's Four Points, Aloft and Element. I've talked already that Four Points and Aloft have the two biggest pipeline growths of any of the 10 brands in our system, so that's encouraging.
Having said that, we know that we're subscale with both the Four Points and Aloft brands, when you can look at other players in the upscale segment, Starwood does not have an entrance at all in the upper midscale segment or midscale segment as defined by Smith Travel Research. And clearly, navigating our way through how that will change at Starwood is what we are engaged in precisely at the moment.

Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious your sense on corporate travel. Could you provide a little bit more color and any trends you saw throughout the quarter and even into July, versus the level seen in 1Q? And then maybe in your discussions with your corporate customers, what's your sense for the trajectory of their room needs and maybe your ability to push pricing higher again into next year?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, let me start with your second question. We're probably too early to call the ball on 2016. We've got our teams down there in the Global Business Travel Association Conference this week trying to get a sense of that demand. Certainly we have been getting our REVPAR growth and our share gains on the back of rate in North America, and have been advantaging transient, which has seen strong rate growth in the last several quarters and that continued into the current quarter. I believe the â as I think I indicated in my script, transient revenue was up 6% in the second quarter, and we continue to see that to be strong, and we're making intentional choices at our hotels to advantage transient over group.
Our group (54:46) have been a bit light, and we predict them to continue to be light, somewhat driven by calendar, somewhat driven by our few big hotels that are going through phased renovations. So we're basically giving instructions to the hotels that if you can get the transient business, hold off and take the transient business, because we do think it's going to continue to grow and we'll be able to drive rate there from our already record occupancy as we experienced in second quarter. But I think it's a bit too early to tell what the mood is and the sentiment is for 2016 at this point.

Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, guys. With the momentum you guys now have on the select service, when do you see the company getting to scale in that segment, and what do you define as your ideal scale?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think the answer to that question actually comes from what is the outcome of the strategic review process. It will be â scale will come much faster if we buy it than if we build it, by definition. And the strategic revenue process is a two-way street. So I think it's premature to answer your question as to timing until we decide what strategy Starwood is going to pursue to accelerate growth in those segments.

Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon. I think, Adam, if I caught it correctly, you were talking about as part of the Sheraton 2020 showcasing the finest examples of Sheraton around the world. That's never really been the problem, right? It's the bottom 10% or 15% of the brand. How many Sheratons do you think have to come out of the system in order to improve the consistency in the guests' opinion?
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
Thanks for the question, but I actually think it's not just an issue of what you're defining as the bottom 10% or 15% of Sheratons. I think it's an issue that transcends the whole Sheraton brand in terms of how well is the Sheraton brand marketed, how well does the consumer understand what Sheraton stands for, from our best hotels to our kind of everyday hotels to our lesser than everyday hotels, where do we stand in terms of preference amongst consumers for the brand? I've been looking at market research since 1979, and one of the questions I always am intrigued by, if you just ask the raw consumer, okay, you got it â if we're talking the hotel industry, if you ask the raw consumer, okay, you're going to London or Chicago, you don't know where you're staying, you don't know who you're visiting, you don't know what part of town you want to be in, you've got to pick a brand of hotels to look at first. What brands would you think of first? And see what they answer, number one, number two, number three.
We think that with a more crisp marketing by Sheraton and a greater amount of marketing activity by Sheraton that we can significantly boost where Sheraton sits in that unaided awareness, that basic â those basic levels of neutral preference questions about where consumers want to stay. We did some significant market research around the Sheraton brands, for example, and we found out, no surprise, that Sheraton Grand has the potential to create a halo for the whole of the Sheraton brand.
In the research study that we looked at, a scientific sample of U.S. business travelers, for example, they were asked if a third of all Sheratons worldwide were renamed Sheraton Grands, not how would that change their perception of those hotels but how would it change their perception of the entire portfolio of all 440 Sheraton hotels? And 75% said the mere fact that we had Sheraton Grands and we talked about our best properties would in fact change their perception of the entire brand. Now having said all that, yes, you are correct that if we have a problematic Sheraton Hotel, whether it's not good enough to be a Sheraton Grand or alternatively whether it's not good enough even to be a Sheraton, that would be alarming. And one other part of the Sheraton plan is to significantly beef up the service culture within Sheraton across all 440 hotels, to look at guest innovation and product innovation at our properties to improve the consumer appeal of all of our hotels.
I don't actually think the largest problem is that we have bad boxes. I would remind you that starting in 2008, when Starwood last addressed Sheraton, we tossed out a significant number of hotels that did not measure up to being Starwood properties. And it's not to say that all 440 Sheratons measure up, because that's not the case. But I don't think that the bottom decile or whatever the word for a twentieth-ile is, I don't think that's Sheraton's biggest opportunity. I think Sheraton's biggest opportunity is to put itself in a position for the consumer to think of the Sheraton brand as more intriguing overall.

Your final question comes from Chris Agnew from MKM Partners.
Christopher James Wallace Agnew - MKM Partners LLC
Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I really just want to follow up on an earlier question. And I might have missed the answer, so I apologize. But will there be additional restructuring costs in the third quarter? And if there will be, are they related to the announced cost savings? And then separately, were there any blackout dates in the second quarter on buybacks? And were you able to buy back as much as you wanted? Thank you.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
The answer is we do expect as part of the announced $30 million to $35 million restructuring program that there will be charges that come through, most significantly when we eventually sell our mothballed plane, we will take a charge that we estimate to be around $9 million to that $30 million to $35 million restructuring program. We've already mothballed it. That asset disposal has not occurred yet. And I do expect that there will be a trickle of charges through the next few quarters, including into 2016 as we conclude the program that we put in place. But I don't â the bulk of it would be done with what we've taken so far with the plane.
Relative to the second quarter buybacks, we've implemented, as I said before, we're looking to be programmatic in our approach. We knew we were going to have the risk of having non-disclosed but material information. And so we put in place a 10b5-1 plan. And as a result of that and some open market purchases that we were able to conclude early in the window, we are able to achieve the target we wanted in the second quarter. Again, we've bought back well ahead of the pace that we indicated for the full year and are pleased that we're going to continue to be in a position to buy back given the 10b5-1 plans we have in place to deliver that $350 million repurchase.
Adam M. Aron - Chief Executive Officer
With that, we're going to bring the call to an end. On behalf of Stephen and Tom, we can't thank you enough for devoting some of your very important time to Starwood today, and all the effort you put in over the course of the year to follow our company. Thanks again.
