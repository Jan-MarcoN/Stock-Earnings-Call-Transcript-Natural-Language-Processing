Greetings and welcome to the Mazor Robotics Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Michael Polyviou with EVC Group. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Polyviou
Thank you, Kevin. We also want to thank everyone for joining us today for the Mazor Robotics conference call and webcast to review the financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. On the call today are Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer; and Sharon Levita, Chief Financial Officer.
Before turning the call over to Ori, I would like to make the following remarks concerning forward-looking statements. All statements in this conference call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may involve and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and other factors that may affect Mazorâs business, financial conditions, and other operating results, which include but are not limited to the risk factors and other qualifications contained in Form 20-F and other reports filed by Mazor with the SEC to which your attention is directed. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Mazor expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
During the call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP net loss and net loss per share. In Mazorâs press release and the financial tables issued earlier today, which is located on the Company's Web site at www.mazorrobotics.com, you will find definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the closest GAAP financial measures, as well as a discussion about why these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant to the Companyâs results.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer, Ori?
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael. And welcome to Mazorâs second quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our record operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the quarterâs results and then we will review the overall market environment and our near and longer term strategy as we seek to build on our leadership position in Roboticsâ spine surgery market.
Earlier this month we announced that we sold seven Renaissance system and one system upgrade in the second quarter of 2015. This performance is more representative of the certain enthusiasm and the robust pipeline we have referenced previously and reflects the optimism I shared with you following our Q1 result in May. On a global basis we ended the second quarter with 93 Renaissance systems with 53 in the U.S. compared with 72 and 39 systems in 2014 respectively. In the second quarter six of the Renaissance systems sold were in the U.S. and seven systems were sold in Spain which represents a new international market for Mazor.
We also sold Renaissance upgrade to a German hospital that has been using spinal system earlier generations of the technology. Our record performance in the second quarter reflects several key achievements. First the six systems sale in the U.S. is the highest number of system of any previous quarter. With these sales we also surpassed the milestone of 50 Renaissance systems installations in the U.S. We successfully completed the 10,000 global procedures this quarter and even surpassed 11,000 procedures by the end of the quarter. This is a critical metric that demonstrates the level of customer satisfaction with our product and the clinical volume they provide to their patients.
As a result of this progress we reported record revenue of 7.8 million in the quarter, a 74% increase compared to the year ago second quarter level. Recurring revenue continued to demonstrate strong growth in the quarter increasing 48% to 3.2 million. The seven systems which were installed were all individual deals with separate hospitals. In the U.S. the six systems were installed in Indiana, Nebraska, Texas, North Carolina and two in Virginia. Three of these new installations were in Richmond, Charlotte and Virginia Beach, new MSA markets for Mazor. The systems sold internationally were installed at Technion medical centers located in Barcelona Spain. Technion is one of the leading hospitals in Spain and already performed a number of procedures with Renaissance allowing us to rapidly build a presence in this new market.
Over the past two years we have been reporting that about half of the cases utilizing the Renaissance system were minimally invasive procedures including multi-level cases which were performed in a minimally invasive surgical approach. This trend was maintained in the second quarter and continued to exceed the broader market share of people for MIS cases which are estimated to be in the range of 12% to 13% of instrumented spine cases. At about four times higher we believe we demonstrate that the Renaissance is indeed an enabling technology for MIS spine surgery.
Surgeonsâ geography and adoption play critical role in converting more surgeons to utilize the Renaissance and experience its benefits. Figures like these help convince surgeons that Renaissance enables MIS spine surgery one of its key valid propositions. Furthermore, surgeons who use Renaissance often comment on how better prepared they are for surgery due to the pre-operative planning and that they are more efficient during the actual procedure all while significantly reducing their exposure for radiation.
As evidenced by the rising procedure volumes Renaissance is clearly becoming an enabling technology. There are several surgeons who have started using our system in lateral access procedures in ways that can cut surgery time by almost an hour. This method of spinal fusion surgery is quite common and the ability to significantly shorten the surgical procedure is of great value to the patients, surgeons and hospitals. The procedure was initiated by the surgeon community following their experience with our Renaissance technology. We planned to showcase the technique at NASS in October and weâre encouraging surgeons to publish their data and share it with the rest of the spine community beforehand.
The interest in the Renaissance is continuing to increase and is currently at record levels. We know from experience that a high majority of surgeons that try the system in our Bioskills Lab become educates for purchasing our products with their hospitalâs administration. However we can rely solely on them to secure the system sales especially as the market environment has changed since we first lunched Renaissance in U.S. market. One of the initiatives we implemented last year is to increase our interaction with the hospital C suite this enabled us to engage with them much earlier in the first quarter to better gauge their level of interest.
We've previously reported our focus on penetrating major metropolitan area where a vast majority of addressable market of almost 400,000 procedures are performed. This strategy is bearing fruit with Q2 sales in Charlotte and two systems in Virginia. To sustain our effort in these and other new regions weâre actively recruiting additional talented capable sales reps. At this point in our market penetration phase our preference into recruit surplus with high level of familiarity with the spine market and with the experience in selling high price innovative technology to hospitals.
Internationally the opening of a new market in Europe is exciting development and could be an encouraging sign of a market growth as economic improve throughout the EU and awareness of our Renaissance technology builds. In Germany we sold a Renaissance upgrade and since this country has moved to the previous generation SpineAssist systems our belief that more upgrade will take place in the future.
In Asia we continue to experience a high level of interest in the Renaissance system with regard to China the recent exposure from Dr. Lieberman treat throughout the country where he also performed a live procedure in front of thousand surgeons elevated the awareness of the Renaissance system. Weâre working closely with our distributor partners in Taiwan, Australia and elsewhere in the vast Asia Pacific region. We have several Bioskills Labs that we have with closed to 100 surgeons attending these labs and we are implementing a broader market campaigns in these markets to develop an even greater pipeline.
We expect to convert some of these great interests in many of these markets to sales during the second half of 2015. We continue to see interest in the brain model from existing users of the Renaissance as well as from new leads as weâre rapidly approaching the 200 great procedures in the U.S. As we stated we anticipate that the brain model will be used primarily for deep brain stimulation surgeries or DBS. DBS procedures are currently used mainly to treat human disorders, such as Parkinsonâs disease. However, this novel treatment is being referred for other possible indications, including the potential market size and more companies are entering this growing market with new equipment.
In June we held the first brain workshop in Denver Colorado led by Dr. David VanSickle from Littleton Colorado and Dr. Wallace from Jacksonville Florida. The workshop was well attended by surgeons who are using the Renaissance including for Brain surgery as well as perspective new surgeons. All met together to exchange ideas and learn new ways to implement Renaissance in their practices. Dr. VanSickle presented a matter of performing the DBS placement surgeries in free patients. In most DBS surgeries the patient are carefully monitored with micro electrode recording in the brain using three to five separate electrodes and are awakened during surgeries for the surgeon to test the efficacy of the electrode as well as determining any side effect. However due to the high acuity achieved with the Renaissance Dr. VanSickle does not believe there is a need for the multiple electrodes and the recording. Eliminating the need for awaken the patient mid surgery.
This technique enables them to drastically shorten surgery time and potentially reduce the risk to healthy brain tissue by inserting a single electrode into the brain greater than three to five. He recently presented his experience to treat and immediately showed interest in learning more about this process as DBS surgeries can be extremely long limiting patient access to this revolutionary treatment option. If you adjust another example how Renaissance is an [indiscernible] technology. Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the second quarter I want to provide an update for our growth strategies.
First we continue to increase our market footprint we added two capital sales reps and with the continued salesforce adjustments we ended the quarter with 12 sales reps weâre continuing to align our team to meet our long-term sales objective of penetrating new regions and metropolitan markets. Our goals increase our capital sales reps to 20 by the end of the year. We are also focused on penetrating the academic institutions and I believe we will demonstrate progress in this during the second half of the year. Despite our success in the second quarter selling systems to individual hospitals we understand the importance of multiple system sales to the large hospital networks.
To live this initiative we enhanced our sales leadership team in the quarter with the addition of Chad Zaring an accomplished medical device sales executive. His vast success and extensive experience with robotic system sales and strategic relationship with these networks should enable us to drive greater awareness of the Renaissance system within this large network and streamline the purchasing decision. Internationally we continue to work with our distribution partner to penetrate new hospitals in countries. As we continue to expand I am also encouraged with the discussion we are having with academic centers.
Second we are focused on increasing the utilization of the systems in use. In the second quarter we had a record utilization with over thousand procedures globally. Of these nearly 800 were in the U.S. and it was due to the hard work and commitment of our clinical sales reps. They help surgeons turn our vision of healing through innovation into reality as patients are benefiting from shortened stay reduced risk and better outcome. Based on our internal calculation if these 800 patients had been operated via free hand about 440 screws would have been displaced about 60 patients would have suffered from complication and 25 would have required a revision surgery. Our product clearly improves outcome and patient care.
Third on our list of priorities is to deliver product enhancement regularly to maintain a high level of surgeon satisfaction. We have a robust pipeline of application procedures, announcement and products that we are going to release to the market in the coming quarters and the surgeons who have been enrolled in their development are really excited by them. Furthermore, Anat Kaphan who recently joined Mazor is Vice President of marketing and product management is tasked with leading our efforts to ensure we address the market need and are well ahead in the competitive curve with regards to future solutions. She has successfully developed and executed strategic business plans for other medical device throughout her career and we are looking forward to the contribution she will make to our product rollout.
And last we promote scientific data that support our value proposition. Earlier this month at the International Meeting on Advanced Spine technologies or IMAST we've the couple of audio presentations. The first included comparative data showing that robotic guided fusion in minimally invasive approach lower complication revisions compared to an open freehand approach. The second presentation demonstrated that the use of robotic is MIS cases significantly reduce the intra-operative use of radiation by more than 60% compared to open free hand cases in a randomized controlled trial of 60 patients.
Our second quarter results reaffirmed my optimism and view that Mazor performance should be measured over on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. As we move into the second half of 2015 weâre committed to growing our install base and driving greater innovation of the systems sold expanding a little on satisfied customers.
Now to review the financial highlights of the second quarter I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori and hello everyone. I'm going to review our financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Geographically revenue in the U.S. was $6.5 million or 83% of total revenue with the 1.13 million or 17% of revenue from international market. Capital sales revenue was 4.6 million in the second quarter of 2015 up from 2.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. As we sold 7 systems and an upgrade in the 2015 second quarter compared to four systems in the year-ago second quarter.
Revenue from disposable kit sales grew to $1.9 million a 59% increase compared to 1.2 million in the last year's second quarter. Reflecting the increase in utilization as well as the increase in the install base, revenue generated from service and other were 1.3 million compared to 0.9 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP gross margin remains high at 79.6% for the quarter, operating expense were 8.4 million compared to 7.7 million in the year-ago second quarter. The increase in expense is primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing as we raise our awareness and broadened our sales footprint globally and continued investment in R&D to support the increased product offering.
On a GAAP basis the net loss for the second quarter was 2.1 million or $0.05 per share compared to net loss of 4.1 million or $0.10 per share in the 2014 second quarter. On a non-GAAP basis the net loss for the period was $1.5 million or $0.04 per share compared to $3.7 million or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Cash used in operating activities in the second quarter was $0.5 million compared to $3.1 million in the last year's second quarter. The decrease in cash used for operating activities mainly attributed to the increase in sales collection in the quarter. As of June 30, 2015 cash and cash equivalents in investment totaled 47.6 million which provides ample resources to execute our business plan.
That concludes my remarks and I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary comments and then weâll take questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. In summary we had a solid second quarter and first half. We continue to increase the market awareness for Renaissance and the data supporting the clinical and economic benefits and record utilization of the Renaissance system. The vision was all to accelerate the adoption and make Renaissance a standard of care. Our growth strategies including the recent addition of Senior Executive in Sales, Marketing and Product Management will enable us to build on our ability position in the robotics spine surgery market. Thank you again for joining the call. Operator weâre now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time weâll be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time we ask that you please limit yourselves to only one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue. [Operator Instructions] And we do ask you to please limit yourselves to only one question and one follow-up and return back to the queue. Our first question today is coming from Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Cohen
Could you talk about the OpEx, Sharon, and with the expansion of the sales force into the second half this year? How might that look toward the end of the year as it's currently clipping at around 8.5 on a quarterly basis?
Sharon Levita
So as we see in the first half of the year there was an increase and we expect also by increasing our salesforce. We are now at 12 capital salesforce and we expect to increase in addition continue to invest in research and development as well as in continuing marketing activities. I think the second half will show a little bit higher increase with that respect.
Jeffrey Cohen
And if you could, one more if I may. Ori, could you expand upon the commentary about product delivery and some of the pipeline for the second half of the year, specific procedures or specific approaches, if you could? Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
As I have said earlier we do have a robust lift of product applications and procedures. Now some of these I mentioned in my earlier one now when I talked about supporting lateral excess, but we have new products and new applications on top of that. As soon as we will be ready for launch and we'll be able to have sufficient clinical evidence to be ready for launch we will introduce into the market I think it is too early but I do believe that during the second half and let's say during the coming 12 months you should expect to see new product and new applications coming from there as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Taylor
So, I wanted to just dig into your comments around some of the system sales. You had better sales this quarter. I guess my general question is, are you ready to call that a trend in terms of being able to get more productivity out of the sales force, number one? And then number two, when you talked about the different regions, you mentioned a few new markets in the U.S. and some interest in Asia. And I'm just wondering how much visibility you have on some of those placements in terms of the timing and the number of placements?
Ori Hadomi
So Matt in terms of trends I think we should be humble at this point of time. And we shouldnât weakness of the company we shouldnât use big volt to define the result. I think that I expected and I said it since the very early of this year and late last year I expected that given the trend of interest and awareness and the level of engagement that we see in the market. And about this I can say is I expect that we will be able to convert this interfere. I donât want to commit how fast all this and I donât want to give you a big volt to say that is the trend that is a trajectory. I can say that we have much wider and stronger pipeline than we ever had before. And in order to put it in full so we will need to wait to see how fast we can covert of this into more sales in the coming quarters. I remain optimistic I feel very good with the trajectory and direction I'm very pleased with the level of engagement of the surgeons and our team, so I feel good about it but I donât want to give big volt in order to quality time and quality trend. Your second question was about the utilization in other territory if you could just repeat the second question.
Matt Taylor
Yes, I was just looking I guess for more specificity on some of your comments when you talked about developing some new markets in the US and whether that gives you more confidence in placements there. You talked a little bit about trying to get people to buy second systems and then also mentioned Asia and expecting to convert some sales there. So, I was just wondering about your level of visibility in terms of timing and likelihood of sales in those three areas?
Ori Hadomi
Okay so these are new three areas that the U.S, Europe and Asia and weâre active in all these areas. And in all our sales out of the U.S. are through distributors. So while weâre working very closely with the distributors we've always serving having done as an intermediate between us and the market. It seems to be based on discussions with our distributors both in Asia and in Europe that the second half will be strong in the international market. Thatâs one thing that we feel very strong about it. And as to the U.S. the level of interest continued just as I mentioned earlier and everywhere where we put when we recruit new people they are paid to generate the interest. So I think there is -- I don't see a linear correlation but there is a good correlation between our ability to bring experienced people to the company and our ability to have a robust pipeline and closings.
Matt Taylor
Maybe just one more follow up. So, that kind of tails into my third question, which is, why do you feel like you need to go from 12 reps to 20 reps? Maybe you could talk about doing that and hiring these additional headcount versus just trying to get more productivity out of the reps that you have?
Ori Hadomi
I think that weâre looking at our models I think we should have more people on the ground in more territories and more areas weâll have just more sales. I think that we have a great platform we've a great product that needs to be sold in the market. And today should we have more people who would sell more. I think that knowing the sales process and the time it takes most of our sales team meet our expectations in terms of productivity based on our models. We know how long it takes and we know how much how hard we work and we believe that what will one more thing we need to do is to bring more people and to -- in order to support ourselves.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Dave Turkaly
And just focusing on some of your new hires, new sales and new VP in marketing, I wonder, do they bring any I guess experience or strategy sort of looking at sort of major metro cities? Do they have a plan, or do you guys have a plan to kind of tackle sort of maybe New York, Boston, or some of the bigger West Coast cities as well as some of the placements you had this quarter?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. We recently hired a sales person in New York we are expanding both in New Jersey weâre looking at these big cities and we are definitely targeting these big cities because we believe that now is the time to sell systems in these areas.
Dave Turkaly
Sort of the follow up to what Matt was hitting on too, 20's a good number. But, given the momentum you have and the cash that you have, why couldn't it be more? It seems that, in certain areas of the space right now, companies that are really ramping up and hiring sales force to get that kind of growth trajectory moving again are being rewarded. I guess I'd just like your thoughts on where you think that's going I guess longer term and why you think only 20 is the right number to exit the year at?
Ori Hadomi
No I agree, I very much agree with your comment. I think that I'm not saying that 20 is where weâre heading I'm just saying be realistic the process of recruiting the team and train them and assimilating them is takes time. As we will be able to know weâre targeting 20 and weâre now in the effort to bring the 20 on board and I believe that this is what we need to do before at the end of the year but weâll definitely continue the hiring following the end of the year. So thatâs no definitely not the final target.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Mas
This is actually Brad in for Mike. Just a first question, I wanted to hit on the competitive front and see what you guys are seeing with any new competitors coming on in the near term or on the horizon?
Ori Hadomi
So to the competitive landscape I think we discussed it the past and I'm happy to refer to you it again, as we said over the last three years we expect at least two other players to be in the market in the coming 24 months. One of them is Global with their acquisition with Excelsius another one is [indiscernible] with the system that today is used for brain but they expect to expand it over to spine. We feel very strong about our answers solution position in preparation to these moves over to give our answers to this so we feel the market is big and wide enough to allow all the three partners to work in the market and actually market and fair to stand out for expand surgery. So we donât see today any of these players as a direct threat that on our solution.
Brad Mas
And I think, on the last call, you were talking about the next couple quarters being really important for the Chinese market. Just wondering if you can give a little more detail or better update and then any other potential growth opportunities abroad?
Ori Hadomi
Yes we believe we are exploring the Chinese opportunity we have a partner there. We invested in the last two quarters quite a lot in marketing activities in China with very a high level of interest and at last from perspective customers that are in serious discussions about buying the system. We need to be very delicate and very sophisticate into process of new market for us we are learning how to see things in the right way. And I'm run fairly and just sell it won't but fairy to the right center that we believe it will be strategically important. So we're working closely with our partners I do see China as a great opportunity but without underestimating other growing engines in Europe I see both Australia and Taiwan as a very promising market. I think that once we will get the clearance in Japan I believe that Japan would be a major growing engine from ago and we see some good funds now there is also in some countries in Europe. But we still believe that U.S. is our main market and this is just reference to other growing engines out of the U.S.
Brad Mas
And then one last quick one, if I can, just wondering -- you talked about on the last call I think with -- on the disposable side with pricing. You're seeing some increasing and not much price pressure on the average selling price. Just wondering if you're seeing that trend continue?
Ori Hadomi
We donât experience any significant pressure on the price not on the capital need but on disposable.
Operator
Your next question today is coming from Tracy Marshbanks from First Analysis. Please proceed with your question.
Tracy Marshbanks
And I want to focus a little bit more on the recurring revenue and the procedure volumes if you could. You had a very strong quarter. Were there trends? Were you getting the low users up to medium users, medium users to high users? Any seasonal impacts in the U.S., or do you think that type of utilization and growth in utilization can be sustained with what you're seeing?
Ori Hadomi
I just think it's a very, very important aspect and thank you for referring to this. I think it's all the above but to be more specific number one yes we do see some seasonality. If you look at previous quarters and you look at annual perspective you can see that the second quarter is a strong quarter and by the way the third quarter if you look at the recount revenue often times is weaker the two because many of the surgeons and patients are taking off to vacation. Number two if you remember late last year we restructured our sales team and we separated between the team that focus on the clinical utilization and the team focus on the capital sales. And this restructuring was critically important and now today we begin to see the short of it. We have a very, very professional executive that manage this clinical team and they did an amazing job to get with the surgeon on finding all this cases while they can bring value and a stimulated system. So answering your question yes we do see that many of these sites that were weaker in the level of utilization we were able to stimulate the system and to make them use it more often and to increase the level of utilization there. All in all we were able to increase the utilization of the system in the country but we did focus on these that where we saw there is a great opportunity and underutilized it and most of the effort was there.
Tracy Marshbanks
And did that apply across geographies, or I know, in the U.S., where you have the direct sales, it's a little bit different, but didn't know if there were consumable recurring revenue trends globally?
Ori Hadomi
I can't refer to as a global trend, the distributors buy from us the disposables in bulks and I don't have really control on the monthly or quarterly utilization. So I can't really comment on that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Craig Bijou from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Bijou
So, I just wanted to ask on -- dig a little deeper into the system sales number for Q2. And I wanted to see if any of the system sales in Q2 were deferred from Q1 or a sale that you had expected to recognize in Q1. And then secondly, were any sales converted earlier than either your average conversion time from the pipeline or sooner than expected?
Ori Hadomi
So into moving between the quarters obviously we've systems and because of sales cycle takes nine months to 12 months we had systems in the pipeline in the first quarter that we closed them in the second quarter. Thatâs a reason I commented in the very beginning as I feel very strong about our ability to meet our objectives for the year and it will be a year of growth. There is one system that we closed within the day after the end of the quarter and the system we hope to close and pay earlier but because of technical reason we close it the day after. Although other systems that were in the process and we expect them to be closed during the second quarter or at least during the first half. None of these systems were systems that we focused to be close in the third quarter. So and to your question did we close some of the system earlier than expected, not yet, weâre not there yet.
Craig Bijou
And then just as a follow up on the capital sales force, I wondered if you could remind us how quickly a newly hired rep becomes productive. And then once that rep kind of reaches full productivity, what -- how many systems per year do you expect that rep to sell?
Ori Hadomi
The time it takes to sales team to be productive is different and they are very much subject to their experience, their familiarity with the market with the product, and of course the training. If I want to generalize it I think that what we saw is that sales team members that were in the company at least a year in the second year they were able to sell around two systems. So I think that just to generalize it many sales team members could close deals also in the first year, but if you want to be more of the safe and conservative way I would say that beginning the second year of their employment in the company we expect them and they -- most of them are able to sale two systems per year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Greg Chodaczek from CRT Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Chodaczek
I'm going to go back to what Tracy was talking about with procedures. If I get my calculations correct and I know they're just very raw numbers here, but for the year, in the U.S., there should be roughly 3,500 procedures using the Renaissance. And that's less than 1% of total procedures out there. And I guess what I'm getting at is you have multiple advocates per system in order to get the system into the hospital. What type of procedures are they using the Renaissance for? And is it mostly one of the -- is it one doctor or the whole group of doctors using it? And how can we get that higher?
Ori Hadomi
Yes so in different optical there are different scenario. We have four and five surgeons using the system and also where we have one champion with user system. The reason one of the main reasons why we have our clinical sales risk in the field is in order to train and coat new surgeons to use the system. And thatâs what we do every morning and every day in the hospital they are focusing on bringing more patients and more surgeons to user system. I donât have former statics that have seen how many of the sites we have more than three and more than five and less than two surgeons. But if I remember correctly we have been average some of these been two three surgeons per system utilizing the system in the U.S.
Greg Chodaczek
And I guess my follow-up question would be, are the -- once a hospital purchases a system, is there any pushback from a hospital not to use the system on a relatively simple case?
Ori Hadomi
Not there is no push like this at all I didnât experience I didnât hear it principally to the opposite they want to make sure it is utilize and this begin the benefit of the once they made an investment. So as I mentioned earlier if you are asking because of the couple disposal please limit the utilization because of the disposable cost thatâs not my experience I'm not aware of it. Or let's say it's not something significant enough that came to my limits.
Greg Chodaczek
And so, we're to a point now where the system is installed in the hospital. If a surgeon wants to use it, they can use it, and there's tremendous upside in the number of procedures for the Renaissance?
Ori Hadomi
I believe so thatâs true.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we do ask you to limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. Our next question today is coming from Michael Needleman from J-Striker Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Needleman
This is somewhat of a new store for me. But, I would like to kind of follow up just a couple of questions that a number of analysts have asked. In terms of procedure volume, and I'm not sure whether or not you release that or not. The previous analyst asked about procedure volumes. Do you actually have the number of procedures that are done on your systems?

In the U.S. we know because we know they buy the disposable kit. The business model consists on capital and disposable kits. So, we know the number disposable kits that they buy and all this cases that we have a sales rep in the room we also know that the case took place. So in the U.S. we have a good track of the utilization out of the U.S. we donât have a good way to know how many cases have been taken place until they buy the next desk.

And just an earlier question because a number of people talked about the sales cycle and sales additions, the eight additional salespeople, which by the way, you are basically doubling the sales force this year, but the eight that you have at least planned for, are they -- is it going to be clinical? And say, how has the division between the two areas of sales that you talked about, is it going to be in -- more in one area, the clinical sales, or more in I guess what I would call just a sales to hospitals?
Ori Hadomi
All the people that I mentioned targeting the 20 will be what we call area sales managers that are responsible to sales capital equipment. The clinical sales reps I did referred to them and we hire them on a quarterly every quarter in correlation with our expectations in the coming quarter.

And last question -- thank you so much for allowing me three. The last -- in terms of distributors, and I recognize that they take the lead baton in terms of sales, currently, how many distributors do you actually have?
Ori Hadomi
We've around 10.

Thank you. We have time for one final question that will be coming from Robert Smith from the Center for Performance Investing. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Smith
My question centers on the Renaissance X. Can you give us some color as to what is Renaissance X? Is it a next iteration for you, or is it further out? How would you explain it to us?
Ori Hadomi
Once it would be released and ready we will introduce the product and weâll talk more about it. Right now it's an R&D project and in the future when it will be ready weâll be happy to introduce it in market.
Robert Smith
And I am in New York. And all I can say is, if you can target the Hospital for Special Surgery, a teaching hospital, has quite a bit of fame, I think you would have a feather in your cap and move the business ahead?
Operator
Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comment.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much everyone. It was a pleasure reporting the second quarter. And thank you for your question, attention and trust and looking forward to talking with you for in the closing of the third quarter where the expectations would be a good one. Thank you very much. Have a good week.
Operator
