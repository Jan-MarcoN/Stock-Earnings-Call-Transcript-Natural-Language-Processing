Greetings and welcome to the QEP resources Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. William Kent. Thank you, Mr. Kent. You may begin.
William Kent
Thank you and good morning, everyone.
Thank you for joining us for the QEP resources third-quarter 2015 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P business.
If you have not done so already, please go to our website, www.qepres.com to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our the financial results and the slide presentation, which contains maps and other supporting materials.
In today's conference call we'll use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled with net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition we will be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ maturely from our forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our Business in our earnings release and SEC filings. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard Doleshek
Thank you and good morning, everyone.
I will quickly give you some color about our third quarter results and our updated guidance for 2015 and then turn the call over to Chuck.
We continue to deliver good results for the third quarter of the year. We set a record for production in the quarter, but we also realized lower prices for our production.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $273 million, down just 2%, compared to $279 million generated in the second quarter of the year and $371 million of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2014. Production in the third quarter was 86.7 Bcfe, or 5.8 Bcfe higher than the 80.9 Bcfe reported in the second quarter of the year.
Oil volumes were 5.2 million barrels, up 286,000 barrels. NGL volumes were 1.3 million barrels, up 89,000 barrels. Natural gas volumes were 84 BCF, up 3.5 BCF from their respective second quarter levels. Crude oil comprised 36% of our total production in the third quarter, which is about the same level as in the second quarter of the year.
Oil production was up 147,000 barrels in the Williston Basin and up 115,000 barrels in the Permian in their respective second quarter volumes. Pinedale gas volumes were up 1.5 BCF. Uinta basin gas volumes were up 1.3 BCF and Haynesville volumes were up about 0.8 BCF from the second quarter.
Our updated guidance for 2015 oil production is a range of 19.2 million to 19.6 million barrels, the midpoint which is up 900,000 barrels from our previous guidance midpoint reflecting results that continue to improve in both the Williston and Permian basins.
Our updated guidance for NGL volumes is a range of 4.3 million to 4.6 million barrels, the midpoint of which is 300,000 barrels above our previous guidance. Our updated guidance for natural gas production is 177.5 to 182.5 BCF, the midpoint of which is 10 BCF above our previous guidance. In aggregate the midpoint of current guidance is about 5.6% above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price, which includes the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $5.50 per mcfe, which is about $0.44 per mcfe lower than we realized in the second quarter of the year. The weighted average field level equivalent price in the quarter was $4.12 per mcfe, which was 14% lower than the second quarter.
The equivalent price reflects field level crude oil prices that were $41.01 per barrel, field level NGL prices that $12.85 per barrel and field level natural gas prices that were $2.69 per MCF. Field level crude oil revenues account for 59% of total field level revenues, which is about 5% lower than in the second quarter.
Revenue settlements added $119.9 million, or $1.38 per mcfe to QEP Energy's net realized price compared to $1.14 per mcfe in the second quarter. QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $137 million in the quarter, up slightly from $133 million in the second quarter, and up marginally from $136 million in the third quarter of 2014.
On a per-unit basis lease operating expenses were $0.65 per mcfe, which is down $0.06 per mcfe from the second quarter, and transportation expense was $0.92 per mcfe, which is down about a penny from the second quarter.
Reflecting the improved operating results we revised our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses downward and now expect that full-year 2015 expenses to be the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per mcfe.
G&A expenses were $42 million in the third quarter which was up about $1.9 million from second quarter when you exclude the $11.2 million charge related to the pension curtailment in the second quarter. We did incur about $3.5 million in costs related to the closure of our Tulsa office in September. So excluding those costs our G&A was down about $1.6 million quarter-to-quarter.
We lowered the upper end of our guidance range for G&A expense for the full year 2015 such that the range is now $170 million to $180 million excluding the $11 million charge from pension curtailment. In the third quarter we generated net income of $21 million. There were several non-cash items that impacted net income.
As a result of the forward crude oil and natural gas prices weakening in the quarter, the value of the derivative portfolio was higher than at the end of the second quarter, resulting in a $34 million unrealized gain compared to $158 million unrealized loss in the second quarter.
DD&A expense was up $22 million from the second quarter driven by higher production volumes. And we also recorded $14.5 million of impairment expense related to mature gas properties in our region as a result of weaker forward curve for natural gas prices. We also recorded a gain on asset sales of $12.9 million associated with postclosing adjustments for various 2014 sales transactions.
Capital expenditures for E&P activities on an accrual basis in the third quarter were $234 million, which was $39 million less than our third-quarter adjusted EBITDA.
In addition we also incurred $23.5 million for various small acquisitions during the quarter. As Chuck will discuss in his comments we have bumped up the bottom end of the range of capital spending for full year 2015 to $975 million, but we left the upper end of the range unchanged at $1.05 billion.
With regard to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter total assets were $8.5 billion, shareholder equity was about $4 billion and total debt was approximately $2.2 billion, all of which was senior notes. We have nothing drawn under our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility, and we have $496 million of cash on the balance sheet.
With that I'll turn the call over to Chuck.
Chuck Stanley
Good morning, everyone.
Since Richard has already discussed our third-quarter operational financial results, I'll spend a few minutes briefly reviewing each of our core areas to share some recent operational highlights before we move on to Q&A.
During the third quarter our asset teams continued to deliver positive results across our entire portfolio. Our continued focus on operational efficiency coupled with our quality assets allowed us to deliver record production in the quarter despite a sharp decline in drilling and completion activity.
In the Williston basin we continue to see encouraging results from our high density infill program and second bench three forks tests. In the Permian we completed and turned to sale seven new wells, all with strong initial performance, while we continued to test additional prospective zones, including our first test of the Leonard shale.
At Pinedale our new completion design continues to deliver superior production results at no incremental cost, while in the Uinta we completed and turned to sales two new horizontal wells and saw strong performance from our latest group of directionally drilled vertical lower Mesaverde wells, which is further confirming the long-term development potential of this multi-tcf resource.
We continue to drive down completed well costs through service and supply cost reduction and through increased operational efficiencies, while delivering well results that continue to exceed our historical results and our initial expectations.
We were also able to drive down lease operating expense on a per-unit of production basis to the lowest level in two years while increasing crude oil volumes from 20% to 36% of total production.
Total gas equivalent production increased 9% from the third-quarter of 2014, and crude oil production was up 10% from the third quarter of last year and was up 6% sequentially from the second quarter of this year.
As highlighted on our second-quarter call, we deliberately slowed down drilling and completion activity during the first few months of 2015, which allowed us to capture additional service cost savings and drive further operational efficiencies in subsequent quarters.
During the third quarter of this -- this decision continued to pay dividends as we continued to make significant progress toward drilling -- lowering drilling and completion costs across all of our areas of operation. Overall AFEs for new wells drilled and completed in our plays have declined over 30% from last year. That's in the oil plays.
And we have even managed to drive down costs at Pinedale by over 14%, and it's an area where we're already so efficient it's been very difficult to squeeze out additional savings. Now let me provide you some color on our recent operational results by area, and as I do so you can refer to the slide presentation that accompanied our earnings release yesterday afternoon.
In the Williston basin we had two QEP-operated rigs running in the third quarter both on South antelope. Williston basin net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that's about 91% liquids, a 3% increase over the second quarter of this year and a 17% increase over the third quarter of last year.
We completed and turn to sales 24 gross operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 83%, and all of those wells were on South antelope. We also participated in 35 gross outside operated wells that were completed and turned to sales with an average working interest of 4%. You can see slides 6, 7 and 12 for the location of our Williston basin acreage.
We continue to be very pleased with the early performance of the first family of high-density infill development wells we completed and turned to sales about six months ago on our south antelope acreage. This group of wells evaluate at 400 and 600 foot high density infill well spacing and also tested the second bench of the three forks formation.
The cumulative production performance of these wells continues to track pretty close to the performance of our enhanced completion design, which you will recall was roughly 50 stage, 1,000 pounds of proppant per foot completion design, continues to track that well performance.
More importantly the wells continue to significantly outperform the original four-well per reservoir per 1280 acre spacing unit parent wells.
On average, these wells have delivered 180-day cumulative production of 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent, outstanding early performance. You can see the details of the current performance of this family of high density infill wells on slide 10.
Our initial test of the second bench of the Three Forks formation at South Antelope continue to perform strongly during the quarter, having now produced over 208,000 barrels of oil equivalent after 180 days on line.
Our subsequent second bench test located in the Northeast corner of our south antelope block has produced over 96,000 barrels of oil equivalent in its first 90 days on line, which is also an excellent result.
During the third quarter we turned two additional second bench wells to sales, and both of these wells have generated very encouraging results during early time production. You can see the aggregate performance of all four Three Forks second bench wells on slide 11. We expect to have three additional second bench wells and our first third bench well turned to sales before year-end.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the completion techniques utilized by us and other operators across the basin, we continue to pump about 1000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot over roughly 50 stages in all of our wells, and we remain convinced that the enhanced completions are critical to maximizing the recovery of crude oil from the Bakken three forks petroleum system.
In late October we were able to take advantage of an opportunity to pick up an additional state of the art drilling rig in the Williston, bringing the current 2EP operated rig count in the basin to three.
Will likely be making additional changes to our rig fleet as we continue to adjust our capital allocation across our asset portfolios for the remainder of this year and into next year in response to changing commodity prices and the changing well cost environment.
We continue to make progress driving down well costs in the Williston, while current gross well AFEs are down on average about 30% from this time last year. Per well productivity is up thanks to our enhanced completion designs.
We expect completed gross well costs for South antelope Wells to be below $6.2 million for the remainder of the year. As a reminder as we infill South Antelope, we will likely introduce more quarter-to-quarter production variability, and this is of course due to the fact that we are going to have more offset well shutins as we go back in and infill South antelope.
And we are also going to be drilling with larger well counts on individual pods, so we will have more wells trapped under drilling rigs going forward in this infill program. We plan to invest about half of our capital budget in the Williston basin in 2015.
Turning to the Permian basin, daily production during the third quarter averaged 13,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 82% liquids. And that was up 16% from last quarter and 47% for the third quarter of 2014. Permian team continued to deliver during the quarter as they focused on optimizing completions and lowering costs, while delivering impressive well results.
This Spraberry continues to outperform our expectations as evidenced by the early performance of another strong Spraberry shale well, the University 7-1726H1, which had a 24 hour peak IP of 1523 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
An additional five Spraberry wells were completed and turned to sales in the third quarter and all are flowing back strongly, but none of them had reached the peak 24-hour IP rates at the end of the quarter. On the delineation front in the Permian we completed and turned to sales our first horizontal well targeting the Leonard shale, which lies immediately above the Spraberry.
This well is flowing back strongly but again has not reached a peak 24-hour IP rate at the end of the quarter. Keep in mind we assign no value to these shallower targets in our acquisition analysis of this acreage. As a reminder in the second quarter we shifted Permian operations to pad development.
The reasons behind this move were two-fold: First, pad development greatly reduces downtime from offset well fracs as we can now batch-complete the wells using the very efficient zipper style techniques. And second, drilling and completion costs are reduced through the efficiencies inherent in the pad development operations, because we don't waste time moving rigs and moving in and out frac crews.
Our current Permian well AFEs have been reduced by an average of over 30% compared to last year, and we continue to drive costs even lower. As a result we expect drilling and completion costs for Spraberry wells to average below $6.3 million for the remainder of 2016.
We had two operated rigs active in the Permian basin at the end of the third quarter. One of those rigs was working on a pod of three middle Spraberry horizontal wells, and the second rig on a two horizontal well middle Spraberry and Spraberry shale pod.
We expect to run two rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year, focused primarily on drilling additional horizontal Spraberry wells, and we plan to invest about 25% of our total capital budget in the Permian basin in 2015. You can see slides 13 through 15 for additional details on our Permian basin properties.
Turning now to Pinedale, net daily production averaged $286 million cubic feet of gas equivalent during the third quarter. That's about 12% liquids by the way.
We added 28 new completions in the quarter and as a result we reached an all-time record for natural gas production, while on our natural gas equivalents basis our production basis a was a little lower than it was in the third quarter of 2012 when we set a record. Of course during that time period we were processing Pinedale gas and ethane recovery. So that boosted the total equivalent volumes.
As reminder in January of this year we began rejecting ethane from Pinedale production, and our guidance anticipates ethane rejection for the remainder of 2015. By rejecting ethane we reduce the natural gas equivalent volumes about 7% or 8% compared to what they would be in ethane recovery. But because of the frac spread on ethane today there is very little impact on revenues.
A recent -- the recent natural gas production record was driven by two main factors. First, we are now drilling in the Stewart Point area of Pinedale, and that's the home to some of the most prolific and highest EUR wells in the entire field.
Second, we continue to see very encouraging results from our new Pinedale completion design incorporating 100 mesh proppant. The combination of these factors resulted in an average gross IP of about 10 million cubic feet of gas equivalent for the wells that we completed during the quarter.
The new design resulted in an average of 171 million cubic feet of gas equivalent production increase in the 270-day cumulative production volumes when compared to direct offset wells that were completed with the old completion design.
Since the new design simply changed in the proppant side, it does not cost any more than the old design. You can see the location of Pinedale and the results of our new completion designs on slides 16 and 17. We currently we plan to invest about 18% of our total capital budget in Pinedale this year, running three rigs for the balance of the year.
In the Uinta net production averaged 96 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, and that was about 21% liquids during the third quarter, 56 million cubic feet equivalent per day of which was from our lower Mesaverde play.
Like Pinedale, we began rejecting ethane in the Uinta Basin in January, and our 2015 guidance anticipates that we will do the same through the remainder of the year. At the end of the third quarter we had one operated rig drilling in the play, and it was drilling our second pad of eight directionally drilled vertical lower Mesaverde wells.
During our second part results we mentioned that we completed and turned to sales a pad with eight directionally drilled vertical Mesaverde wells, and these wells which are using -- utilizing an aggressive stimulation designs were drilled to test a Pinedale style development concept which we think is applicable for a portion of our Uinta acreage. During the first 140 days on line this group of eight wells produced over 2.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent gross. And that was in refrigeration processing, by the way.
It's a very encouraging result. The average gross drilling and completion costs for these wells was about $2.24 million, and we think we can do even better than that cost in full development mode. Our most recent horizontal Mesaverde well was drilled in 29 days compared to a an AFE plan of 45 days and had a total gross drilling completion cost of under $7 million.
Also note that during the quarter we added 15,000 net acres immediately south and contiguous to our core Red Wash unit. We accomplished this acquisition by trading our interest in a 640-acre unit with another Uinta Basin operator.
We believe the acquired acreage is highly prospective for the lower Mesaverde, and we look forward to testing it in the near future. If successful we believe this acreage if developed with directionally drilled verticals wells on 20-acre density could add up to 760 future drilling locations. You can see the location of the new acreage, which is called South Red Wash on slide 18.
We continue to believe that the lower Mesaverde play has Pinedale like potential, and the latest well results are the next step along the path to economically developing this multi-tcf resource. We expect to continue testing vertical and horizontal wells across the acreage as we expect that the ultimate development plan will include a combination of both well designs. And we also expect to continue to operate one rig in the lower Mesaverde play for the remainder of 2015.
So in conclusion, QEP's solid third-quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive capital and operational efficiency in all the areas of our Business that we can control. We continue to drive down gross completed well costs in our core plays, while substantially improving overall well performance through enhanced completion designs.
We continue to add additional economically attractive inventory to our existing evidence -- assets as evidenced by our recent well results in the Permian, the Williston and Uinta basins, and we have accomplished all of these things while living within our means.
We continue to work diligently to transform QEP into one of the more focused and balanced E&P companies with a deep portfolio of high return investment opportunities capable of delivering superior returns in a variety of market conditions.
We remain focused on improving the quality and depth of our portfolio by continued innovation, superior execution, a relentless focus on driving down costs and by identifying and driving the development of organic opportunities.
Our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, including a cash position of nearly $500 million puts us in a great financial position for the future.
With that, Bob, we can open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Audio gap]
â¦both gas prices and NGL prices just don't bode well for the same level of activity going into '16 in the gas plays.
So some may be a redirection of capital as you have seen potentially adding another oil directed rig, decreasing gas directed rigs, moving rigs around basically on our portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst
All right thanks and great quarter.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks Brian.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Gamble
Good morning, guys. Maybe just a follow-up on that Chuck. When you talk about moving rigs around is that because you do see some additional potential for either delineation or some of the tests that you're working on up in the Bakken?
Or are those based on contracts for the rigs where you need to keep them running somewhere and maybe drilling gas is not the best idea but drilling oil is at least a viable alternative?
Chuck Stanley
The answer to that is that we are fortunate we have very short duration on all of our rig contracts. A lot of them are well to well or month-to-month. So it's not driven by contractual obligations at all.
As we've said on many calls and one-on-one meetings, we allocate capital based on returns and we're just responding to the relative returns in our portfolio and reallocating capital from the current allocation to focus our dollars in the areas with the highest returns.
Brian Gamble
Perfect.
Chuck Stanley
Maybe I should also add that when I say moving rigs around, we're not likely physically moving the rig from one area to another. We lay down a rig in one area. We pick up another rig in the other area.
We have been fortunate in many instances that the drilling contractors the we have long-term relationships with happen to have rigs available in each of the areas where we are active, and we have been able to effectively lay down one rig on paper pick up another one on paper some place else. They're all about the same size, frankly.
Brian Gamble
Understood. On the particularly on the gas front you mentioned weakness and obviously we're staring at gas prices, that is not all that economic in many plays. In Pinedale with your new completions still seem a little bit economic and getting more so.
But could we see that rig count go zero next year if gas prices stay kind of sub $2.25 or $2.50 through the winter? Or is that something that would I guess not be the best longer-term play to go all the way down to zero or one?
Chuck Stanley
Brian, it's probably not -- first of all I'll preface this by saying that we're on iteration 5291 on our 2016 plan. So is probably a little early to give you the absolute answer, but I think relatively it's unlikely we will have the same rig count and Pinedale moving into year end the next year as we have right now.
Will it go zero? Probably not. There's various reasons why we would like to keep some activity level out there.
And one of them is that we fought long and hard to get permission to drill and complete wells year-round at Pinedale. And I don't want to stop doing that and potentially reopen additional federal studies before we could reoccupy Pinedale year-round.
Even though there's another large operator to our south that's going to be doing it year-round. There's still some risks there, and we just need to make sure we think that carefully.
Brian Gamble
All right, Chuck, and a last quick one. Any anecdotes you can give us for -- I know you haven't given a result yet, but as far as the drilling is concerned in the Leonard, any differences between that and what you have seen in the Spraberry?
Chuck Stanley
It seemed to be at least from where I sit about the same as the Spraberry. It's obviously a little shallower so we have less scenery to drill through to get to the good stuff.
And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks we try not to step out a quarter, but the flow back on the Leonard wells is making over 600 barrels of oil equivalent and looking pretty strong. Obviously it's shallower well, cheaper to drill and quite pleasant surprise for us, and we think it's certainly economically viable even in this price environment.
Brian Gamble
Great, much appreciated.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
David Tameron
Good morning. Chuck, how do you think about -- given where service costs are, how do you think about Haynesville versus Pinedale? Kind of absent regulations headed think about the economics between the two right now?
Chuck Stanley
They're probably about a push. One of the challenges in the Haynesville as we've said many times -- let me qualify that.
First, I think that there has been a fundamental change in Haynesville economics as a result of some operators in who pushed the size of stimulation that we have historically pumped up to in some instances over 3000 pounds per foot -- per lateral foot, 3000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot, which has made a noticeable difference in early time well performance.
Two, the lateral length has been increased. When we were actively developing our Haynesville asset our typical lateral length was 4500 feet or so. And today most operators have moved to roughly 7500 foot laterals, so they are drilling cross unit wells. And that was a regulatory challenge back in the day when everybody was active, but the state has reacted positively to proposals from other operators.
So the additional lateral length is helping the overall economics, and it's making the wells roughly competitive with Pinedale. You still get a little -- remember that Haynesville gas is dry so you are not getting any liquids uplift, and, in fact, you are incurring some cost to clean the gas up to reduce the CO2 level down to a 2% or less which is a typical spec, so there's some processing or treating that goes on.
You still get some liquids value uplift in the Pinedale gas stream albeit a heck of a lot less than it was a couple of years ago. Ethane margins were basically null. Propane -- as propane prices even at Mt Belleview have declined precipitously, and the current pricing relationship between WTI and propane is some of the widest that I have seen in my career, or maybe not in my career, but in a very long time. And that is having a pretty dramatic negative impact and margins at Pinedale is making us look hard at it.
But all in all higher rates for Haynesville wells, higher IPs help juice the return. The longer laterals help. At Pinedale the recent larger completions have really enhanced the performance of the wells.
And we're in basically the sweet spot of the entire Pinedale, so we're getting excellent well results. We've been able to drive down the cost about 14% from last year.
So it's a push right now. But that kind of gives you maybe more color than you wanted on the two plays.
David Tameron
No, that was helpful. And let me throw the question that you don't like to answer about 2016, and I know you are not going to answer it, but can you give us some framework as far as we all have our different price assumptions?
We talked about returns being the priority, but is that return based on cash flow numbers? Should I a plug-in whatever deck I am assuming and just assume you are going to spend EBITDA for a CapEx budget, or can you give us some color around that?
Chuck Stanley
I will give you a little color and that is that were generally viewed 2016 as the year when we are going to live within our means. We are going to try to balance CapEx and EBITDA or -- and focus really on total cash flow.
And based on the 5000th run that we have done. I can't remember the exact number that I told you before since I made it up anyway.
The answer is flattish production next year is we're spending in that ZIP Code. And you can put whatever number you want, but at current forward strip prices that results in flattish production year-over-year. And I think that's a pretty decent result given the commodity price environment we find ourselves in.
David Tameron
That's helpful. I will jump back into queue and let somebody else ask.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Rezvan
Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my call. I'd like to add on a bit to what Brian was asking about before on the Bakken locations. Can you just clarify -- are second bench wells in that current count?
Chuck Stanley
Yes, there are, and they're in there. If you close your eyes and imagine a chevron or V-shaped spacing pattern that is our current sort of model.
Although we place some second bench wells immediately under first bench wells, and we have not seen the kind of interference that we had anticipated. So that could change the pattern of potentially add some locations. And as I mentioned the third bench is additional upside.
And we tend to focus on South Antelope, because that's where we have done our piloting. But I should also point out that a lot of the well results that we're generating on South Antelope are potentially applicable to our Fort Berthold acreage as well, and we really have not talked about what that means for inventory increase there. But it's potentially meaningful.
Tim Rezvan
I appreciate that color. And then on the infill pilots outperforming we see 180 days of data that suggests a 40% plus uplift, and just to confirm off the 1.1 million barrel EUR base that you have reported. Is that accurate?
Chuck Stanley
Yes, roughly a million barrel EUR -- a million barrel oil equivalent EUR. But as I have said before, and I think it's worth repeating, I don't think you can translate the performance the early time 180 day performance uplift one-for-one to an increase in EURs. Obviously we're comparing two different styles of completions.
We're clearly contacting new rock here, because we see well performance that surprises us. These wells are flowing when we put them to sales so they are touching the reservoir which is not being contacted by the initial pattern of four wells per reservoir per spacing unit.
But ultimately we're connecting up all of the rock, and we think that we will see some interference, and we're not seeing a lot of evidence early on. But we think we will see some interference over the lives of these wells.
What I am watching, Tim, is the performance of the infill wells versus the parent wells. And after 180 days we continue to see divergence of the two curves, and that tells me that we're continuing to see incremental recovery, not interference yet, and that's a good thing.
But ultimately will these wells have higher EURs? Probably, but I don't think you'll see a proportional increase in EURs versus early time performance. I think that's an unrealistic expectation.
Tim Rezvan
Okay, but I guess you have more commentary after we get year end reserves this year?
Chuck Stanley
Yes, although I think it's still going to be a challenge for both our in-house engineers and our reserve preparers to predict long-term reserve increases. I think they will tend to be conservative at least until they see a little more time on the existing wells and some additional wells with production history.
Tim Rezvan
Okay. Then if you can take the inventory discussion and move to the Permian, you have uses horizontal location number of about 775 for several quarters now, and obviously there's a lot of testing into multiple zones going on.
When do you plan on getting more granular with what you're seeing across that acreage position? If I'm correct you have not really given inventory by zone. You're testing things you weren't discussing a year ago.
Chuck Stanley
Right.
Tim Rezvan
What can you tell us about that?
Chuck Stanley
I think we can start to quantify some of the zones where we have now drilled closely spaced wells like the Spraberry. Obviously the Leonard is going to be problematic, because we have one -- a grand total of one well, and there is not a lot of offset activity.
But as we get into year-end and we go through the reserve process, and we start to look at the confirmation of assumptions around well density in some of the more drilled targets, we can start to quantify that number. It's is still going to be difficult to quantify things like the Leonard until we have more well control, frankly.
Tim Rezvan
Okay. Sorry did not have any 2016 questions for you, but I will step off here. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Oatman with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
Ryan Oatman
Hello, good morning. I want to speak to this Uinta Basin here. You mentioned that vertical concept with these aggressive stimulation should be applicable on a portion of your Uinta basin acreage.
Can you just provide some clarity on how much of your almost 250,000 net acres you see this concept is potentially applicable for? Is it only the Red Wash and I guess the southern acreage picked up?
Chuck Stanley
So far, Ryan, our focus has been on the Red Wash unit. There are some wells drilled to the west of Red Wash in a unit called Wonsits Valley. We have not focused our efforts there because it's deeper, but with depth comes high-pressures and more potential reservoir storage so potentially higher pressures and higher EURs.
The comment about a combination of vertical and horizontal wells is in certain areas in our acreage, the stacked nature of the pays may be more amenable to vertical wells -- directionally drilled vertical wells like Pinedale where we drill from pads and directionally drill out and then turn the wells vertical on 20 acre spacing than drilling multiple horizontal wells. Because we still leave behind a bunch of gas when we drill multiple horizontal wells.
There is a block diagram on slide 19 in the slide deck that shows the horizontal concept, but as you can imagine if you drill a vertical -- evenly spaced vertical wells through the interval, not only would you tap the individual targets that are shown, but you could get the intervening sands.
And we're just not convinced were getting enough frac growth, enough height on our factures to contact all of the gas burning sands of the interval, especially in certain areas. In certain areas we think we can do it with horizontal wells, and in other areas we think the vertical concept is more applicable.
Ryan Oatman
That's very good. And then looking at the productivity of these initial eight Uinta basin gas wells it does appear to be about 20% more productive at least early days than some of the latest Pinedale wells here with the new completions and arguably one of the better spots in the field.
What concerns do you have about replicating the success of these eight wells sort of across the Uinta Basin as you are testing this vertical concept?
Chuck Stanley
One thing that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have substantially modified the completion technique that we use. We substantially increase the proppant loading in the recent, the seven or eight wells that are currently on production that produce 2.4 BCF in their early life.
We are currently drilling another set of eight wells in a different part of our acreage, and we will apply the same large stimulation design to those wells, and let's see how they perform. We are optimistic that with the bigger fracs that we can replicate the performance on this first pod of eight wells.
There's nothing unique about where we drill those wells. We sort of plop them down in the middle of our acreage to see if the bigger fracs would work.
And just like everywhere, in all active plays in the US, the corollary between increase proppant loading or increased number of pounds per stage or pounds per foot, it seems to work here in the Uinta as well.
Ryan Oatman
All right, that's very good. And then shifting over to the Permian here, I want to see if you can speak I guess, too, to the Leonard shale and help us understand the lithology of that zone and what you saw pre drilling that led to that being a target here.
Chuck Stanley
Well, the Leonard shale if you look at it on wireline logs, and I don't think we actually have a core through it. We just had wireline logs and cuttings. It looks just like the Spraberry.
It has got organic content similar to the Spraberry similar porosity, lightly more porous and permeable than the Spraberry, because it's a little shallower. So it was a logical target.
It had been perforated and fraced in some vertical wells and those vertical wells gave us an inkling that it would be productive and potentially commercial in horizontal well which is what led us to drive a horizontal lateral in the Leonard.
Ryan Oatman
Right that makes sense. And one final one for me here. It does seem like the Spraberry shale that you speak to is comparable to what some of your peers call the lower Spraberry. I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you feel you are attacking the middle and lower Spraberry differently from your peers here?
Chuck Stanley
I don't think so. I think we're basically landing our laterals. We may be landing our laterals in a slightly different target horizon.
But looking at the results that we're achieving recently and the overall performance of the wells, and I don't have at my fingertips or at my arms reach a technical person who can answer the detail nuance or compare our exact landing zones and completion designs.
But I think we are pretty well following the same well designed and targeting that our neighbors are following.
Ryan Oatman
That's helpful. Thanks for all the color.
Chuck Stanley
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Michael Rowe] [ph]. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks. Just on point 2016, sorry I'm going to ask another one here. You were talking a little bit earlier about flattish production within cash flow at the current strip.
But I just wanted to see if you are thinking about cash flow in terms of EBITDA still or EBITDA after interest expense, because I think you previously talked about trying to spend within EBITDA? So just clarifying that would be helpful.
Richard Doleshek
I said cash flow and that would include interest expense and dividends. And where we end up -- we have targeted historically spending around EBITDA. And that's our initial look, and we might be a little over EBITDA in total CapEx.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And as you think about capital allocation and focusing on the highest rate of return opportunities, is it fair to say that we should continue to expect that the Williston could attract the lion share of the capital and maybe even more than the 50% allocation roughly that you all are targeting in 2015?
Chuck Stanley
That's -- clearly the Williston asset, the south antelope asset in particular has the highest returns in our portfolio. There is a natural limit as to how much activity we can have on South Antelope because we are infilling, and you start to have a significant impact on current production if you could imagine putting very many more rigs to work there, because you have a lot of shut-ins for offset frac. So there is a theoretical limit as to the level of activity just on South antelope.
On Fort Berthold we could add a rig or two there. As I said earlier we're still on version 5000 of our 2016 planning, and we have not nailed down the details yet on exactly how we are going to allocate capital. Part of it is ongoing well results.
We're seeing better performance across the board in all of our areas, and we're seeing costs coming down. Some cost coming down disproportionately in some areas compared to others, and that may drive part of our capital allocation decision going into '16.
Unidentified Analyst
Very helpful. Thanks for your thoughts.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Neal Dingmann
Good morning. Just two quick ones. One is on M&A, your thoughts as far as what you have seen in some bolt on opportunities? And then secondly for M&A on the potential sale side, are levels of call it leverage liquidity that you would like to keep that you might think about doing some asset sales?
Chuck Stanley
Sure, Neal. There are some bolt on opportunities, and we are continuing to work on some across our portfolio. As we reported we were able to add some acreage in the Uinta just south of our red wash core area.
We're working on some opportunities in other areas. I'd rather not get into the details around them. But there are some active deals being worked by our A&D team. On the leverage side I will let Richard comment on that.
Richard Doleshek
Hey, Neal. I think that were pretty satisfied with our liquidity level right now. We're sitting on $0.5 billion in cash.
We expect additional tax refunds next year, and we've got the unused revolver. Obviously to the extent that we'd make an acquisition and push our leverage levels higher than they are today, we'd consider an asset sale to de-lever just like we did back in 2014.
Neal Dingmann
Very good. Thank you all.
Operator
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time have for questions today. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chuck Stanley for closing remarks.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks, Bob. We continue to work diligently to transform QEP into a more focused and balanced E&P company. And obviously we've got a deep inventory of high return opportunities that we believe are capable of developing superior -- delivering superior returns in a variety of market conditions.
We have a great balance sheet, as Richard mentioned, with ample liquidity. And we've got I think the right team, the right assets and the right focus to continue to deliver superior results in a variety of commodity price environments.
With that I would like to thank you all for dialing in today and for your interest in QEP Resources.
Operator
This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.
