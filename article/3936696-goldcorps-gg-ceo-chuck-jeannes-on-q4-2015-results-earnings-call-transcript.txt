With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and CEO.
Chuck Jeannes
Thanks, Jeff and thanks, everyone for joining us today on what is my last earnings conference call with Goldcorp. Since the announcement of my retirement in December, Iâve worked closely with Dave Garofalo and the rest of the executive team on effecting a smooth transition, and this process has gone extremely well. So, we decided with the Boardâs blessings to move up the official handover of the President and CEO titles to February 29th, next Monday.
Dave has immersed himself fully into the day-to-day business of running this Company, and his insights and guidance have already proven very beneficial. I am confident that leaving Goldcorp in great hands.
Because of this, weâre altering our usual conference call format, so you can hear more from Dave on his initial thoughts and plans for the Company. This will also allow us to get your questions sooner, as there is a lot of information to cover.
I want to lead off with the review of 2015. There were three very positive results in Goldcorpâs 2015 performance: First, we achieved production and all-in sustaining cost guidance with a record 3.46 million ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $852 per ounce excluding impairments. This was a year in which our teams ramped up two large new underground gold mines and withstood fourth quarter production issue in the Pueblo Viejo joint venture. Second, despite a 12% drop in the gold price year-over-year, we generated strong free cash flow of $335 million. Finally, we replaced gold reserves collectively at our six core assets compared to the previous year, despite using an $1,100 gold price for reserve calculations compared to $1,300 last year. The average grade of our reserves increased significantly, while reserves in gold equivalent terms actually increased by 2%.
Now, Iâm certainly aware that our shareholders are disappointed with some of the news this morning, and I definitely share that disappointment. I hate that we have had to take such a large write-down. The fact that nearly all of our peers have done the same or worse over the last few years, doesnât soften the blow of having to remove this value from the balance sheet in the face of lower gold prices. As well, I know our forward-looking production guidance does not meet your expectations.
I have a few comments. First, we have only included ounces that we are certain will be produced. So, all of the organic growth opportunities remain as upside to this forecast. Most importantly, to me personally is my disappointment at Cochenour. I helped buy this project and have pushed it along for the last seven years. We had planned and hoped for this deposit to be in production this year but itâs simply geologically complex than we expected. And I am confident that Cochenour will be an important part of Red Lakeâs future. But until itâs determined exactly how itâll be mined and how much it will produce, it wonât be in the guidance.
As well, no one is happy seeing our reserve reduction. We believe that using $1,100 gold was appropriate, assuring that all the ounces in our reserves and mine plans are strongly profitable. The bulk of the reduction comes from a single large cutback at Los Filos. Those ounces will now remain as upside in our resource statement.
Finally, regarding the dividend. $1,100 gold we would have been paying essentially 100% of our free cash flow in dividends. As shareholders, none of us likes the dividend cut, but I personally am more interested in seeing that the Company has the resources to invest in organic growth opportunities and maintain excellent financial flexibility in any gold price environment.
So, on to the details of the quarter. Gold production totaled 909,400 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $977 per ounce. Costs in the fourth quarter and for the year were impacted again by a non-cash write-down of the heap leach inventory at Los Filos. Excluding these impairments of $110 per ounce, all-in sustaining costs were $867 per ounce for the quarter and $852 per ounce for the year.
Adjusted quarterly revenues totaled $1.2 billion with strong adjusted operating cash flow of $339 million and most importantly, we generated free cash flow of $239 million, the third consecutive quarter of free cash flow generation.
Turning to our operations: PeÃ±asquito had an outstanding year, delivering record production of 860,300 ounces at all-in sustaining cost of $544 per ounce. As we have indicated throughout the year, grades were expected to moderate over the year as mining transitioned away from the high grade portion of the pit and that as indeed been the case in the fourth quarter as we produced 169,900 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $687 per ounce. For the same reason, as planned, 2016 gold production will decrease to between 520,000 and 580,000 onuses.
I am also happy to report that the construction of the Northern Well Field has recommenced and is expected to be completed late this year. In the meantime, we continue to have sufficient water to maintain full operations.
Cerro Negro also turned in a very successful first year of operations, exceeding guidance with gold production totaling 507,400 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $769 per ounce. The milling exceeded expectations with throughout above nameplate while optimization efforts led to higher metal recoveries, particularly silver.
With the stockpile fully depleted at the end of 2015, Cerro Negro will operate on direct mined ore feed, but improved underground development rates in 2016 should position the mine for sustained excellence for the next several years. Full year 2016 production guidance is expected to be in the range of 475,000 and 525,000 ounces.
Conditions are improving overall in Argentina with very positive news continuing to flow from the new presidential administration. Easing currency controls and export taxation, devalued Argentine peso, and decreasing import restrictions will provide favorable tailwinds as we begin 2016.
Most of you are aware that we had some challenges in ÃlÃ©onoreâs first year of operations but I am proud with the way the team finished the year strongly. Throughput average 5,700 tonnes per day over the second half and achieved nameplate design capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day, several times during the fourth quarter.
Similar to Cerro Negro, ÃlÃ©onore has depleted its surface ore feed stockpile, emphasizing the importance of ramping up underground mining rates in 2016. Production guidance is forecasted between 250,000 and 280,000 ounces on expected average throughput of 4,900 tonnes per day from four production horizons. So, weâve made good progress at ÃlÃ©onore and Cerro Negro but weâre only beginning to see their full potential as cornerstones of Goldcorpâs portfolio.
Turing to Red Lake, we took action during the year to reposition the mine for sustained long-term success. The focus in 2016 is on further optimization and cost reduction efforts and to that end, weâve recently announced an 8% staff reduction at Red lake. Continued transition to mechanized mining and automation is expected to contribute to lower but more profitable production of between 300,000 and 330,000 ounces in the year ahead. Advancing our knowledge of the HG Young discovery and Cochenour will contribute to Red Lakeâs overall optimization plan.
Looking further into our reserves and resources, lower metal prices impacted our gold reserves, as they have everyone else in our sector, but overall, Iâm pleased with the resilience of our overall gold reserves, especially at key assets. In the aggregate, gold reserves at the core assets, PeÃ±asquito; Cerro Negro; Pueblo Viejo; ÃlÃ©onore; Red Lake; and Musselwhite were unchanged at approximately 30 million ounces versus the prior year. So, we replaced mine reserves through exploration.
The key drivers for the overall decrease in gold reserves was the reclassification I mentioned of 5.3 million ounces of all low margin Los Filos reserves into resource as well as the replacement of 1.8 million ounces of gold reserves at ÃlÃ©onore with much higher copper reserves. Recall that we combined that asset into the Corridor joint venture with Teck Resourcesâ Relincho copper project in order to share infrastructure and save capital expenditures. So, as a result, our overall gold equivalent reserves actually increased by 2%. On the resource site, we saw important growth in gold resources at Cerro Negro, HG Young and Pueblo Viejo.
Our gold reserves were calculated using a gold prices assumption of $1,100 per ounce. An increase of $100 in the gold price would result in gold reserves increasing by approximately 2 million ounces. So, this is a high quality reserve base that provides valuable gold exposure to investors and constitutes a rock solid foundation for Goldcorp.
And with that, Iâll turn it over to Lindsay for a brief review of the key accounting items.
Lindsay Hall
Thanks Chuck. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported the net loss of $4.3 billion or $5.14 per share. Included in the reported net loss were impairment charges of $3.9 billion or $4.69 per share and unrealized foreign currency translation losses and other of $247 million or $0.30 per share. Excluding these items, adjusted net loss was $128 million or $0.15 per share. Included in the $0.15 per share was a $0.12 related to a non-cash reduction in inventory carrying values, primarily Los Filos and an equity loss at Alumbrera of $0.04 per share.
In the quarter, impairment charges of $3.9 billion net of tax rose primarily as a result of a reduction in long-term metal price assumptions and lower exploration potential values. Our impairment calculations assume the flat, long-term gold price of $1,100 per ounce and a long-term silver, copper, zinc and lead prices of $16.50 per ounce, $2.75 per pound, $0.95 per pound, and $0.90 per pound respectively. Long-term foreign exchange assumptions of $1.20 Canadian to U.S. and $14.50 Mexican peso to USD were used for our Canadian and Mexican operations. In Argentina, the impact of the peso devaluation was offset by inflation after 2016.
Turning to cash flows: The Company generated for the fourth quarter adjusted operating cash flows of $339 million or $0.41 per share, which is before the positive change in non-cash operating working capital of $63 million. Given these operating results and capital expenditures on the cash basis of $240 million for the quarter, the Company generated positive free cash flow before dividends of $239 million for the quarter.
Before turning it over to Dave, Iâll conclude with a word on our balance sheet. The sale of non-core assets and investments as well as $1 billion increase in our available credit line during 2015 contributed to further strengthening of our already rock-solid balance sheet. We are committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and target a debt to EBITDA ratio between 1.5 to 2. And undrawn $3 billion revolving credit facility and a positive cash balance leaves us with $3.5 billion of liquidity at December 31st, and in the strong financial position with one of the best balance sheets in the business.
With that, Iâll turn it over to Dave.
David Garofalo
Thank you, Lindsay, and thanks to you Chuck. Iâve spent the better part of last few months working with Chuck and I am grateful for the generosity with his time and energy in ensuring that this would be a smooth transition. Iâd also spent significant time with the management team and have traveled to many of our operations. Everywhere Iâve gone thus far, Iâve been impressed with the commitment and engagement of the people who make up this Company. I consider the privilege to be selected to build on Goldcorpâs success and I take seriously my responsibility to maintain the strategic direction set out by my predecessors and the Board of Directors.
However, we will reorient the organization to reflect the fact that weâve exited a period of large capital expenditures and mine construction, and entered into a state of optimizing a very strong, low cost and sustainable 3 million ounce per year business. We intend to compound the substantial returns we are now generating by reinvesting in robust pipelines of internal opportunities.
Goldcorpâs blueprint for delivering shareholder value is underpinned by commitment to two core principles: First, we will grow our business by focusing on net asset value per share growth as opposed to the accumulation of gold ounces at any cost; and second, weâll will compound the returns from our existing mines into organic growth and Brownfield exploration around existing infrastructure, which we believe provides the best returns at the lowest risk.
Consistent with the business philosophies of my previous companies Inmet, Agnico and HudBay, growth in NAV is accomplished through empowering my managers to run their operations as businesses. Each of them has been impressed with a significant amount of our shareholders capital and with that goes a responsibility to generate an adequate rate of return on that capital and to perpetuate their businesses by seeking opportunities to grow the entity of their respective operations. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways including exploration success, Brownfield expansions and cost efficiencies. That means that our lean executive team will focus on managing our portfolio of assets and disciplined allocation of scares capital for which each of our business units must compete.
Disciplined capital allocation is already very much a part of Goldcorpâs DNA, as it has much stronger record of any decrease [ph] over the last decade than many of our peers. But, as we enter the harvest phase, we have an opportunity to sweat our existing assets and grow our net asset value more quickly and efficiently through a series of relatively low capital intensity organic opportunities. We will also continue Goldcorpâs proven success and unlocking values through the divestment of noncore assets within the portfolio and redeploying that capital into opportunities that move the need for the Goldcorp.
Organic growth and Brownfield exploration allows to add high value gold reserves at a low cost by leveraging the infrastructure and geologic expertise at our existing mine base in some of the prolific and underexplored gold districts in the world.
Outside of our mine sites, we appreciate that there are few large scale gold deposits available in the world, but we intend to help cultivate the next generation of development opportunities by having a well diversified portfolio of small investments in multiple junior companies. Chuck has every right to be proud of the strong operating portfolio heâs left behind but I am equally excited about the full pipeline of organic opportunities we have inherited from the execution stage in Hoyle Deep to the conceptual stage at Project Corridor. While none of these projects other than Hoyle Deep are included in our production guidance, many of them have the potential to contribute meaningfully to NAV growth and our production profile over the next three to five years.
2016 production guidance is forecasted between 2.8 million and 3.1 million ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of between $850 and $925 per ounce and byproduct costs of between $500 and $575 per ounce.
With new mines essentially built, significant development risk has been removed from the portfolio, as sustaining capital spending is expected to decline to an annual average of $700 million to $800 million for 2016 to 2018 inclusive. In 2016, we have budgeted an additional $100 million to advance our organic project pipeline through various phases of study. We will maintain Goldcorpâs successful exploration program in 2016 thorough a highly focused investment of $135 million aimed at expanding key new gold discoveries and operating our measured and indicated gold reserves at 38 million ounces and inferred resource of 18 million ounce at our exiting mines and projects.
On a longer time horizon, Goldcorp has a sustainable production profile of approximately 3 million ounces as we continue to ramp at our new mines and the return of higher grade of PeÃ±asquito towards the end of the decade, offset declining production at short life mines such as Los Filos, Marlin and Alumbrera. However, production guidance does not include potential gold production from the suite of organic growth projects, nor does our all-in sustaining costs guidance of 850 to 925 per ounce include the potential economies of scale that are expected to come from the expansion of our existing mines contemplated in our project pipeline.
Even without these projects, our shareholders can expect to enjoy significant free cash flow at $1,200 per ounce gold and substantial leverage to gold as every $100 increase would add approximately $300 million to our free cash flow profile. This cash flow profile puts us in an excellent position to finance our growth internally and compound returns for our shareholders while maintaining our investment grade rating.
Achieving these goals can be made significantly easier by virtue of one of the best asset portfolios in the business in terms of long-lived, low cost assets located within low political risk jurisdictions. Having toured many of them, I wanted to take this opportunity to share my first impressions, both the good and some of the challenges.
Following a successful 2015 ramp up at Cerro Negro in Argentina, the focus in 2016 will be on infrastructure development and capital allocation towards realizing the vast, untapped potential at this mine. In addition to the immediate benefit from the devaluing local currency, weâre hopeful that with the improvement of the Argentinian economy, there will be opportunities to expand the operations and drive efficiencies in labor and procurement in the medium term. With the possible exception of ÃlÃ©onore, no other asset in our portfolio provides a higher level of potential reserve growth, a focused $16 million Bain exploration program is positioned to do just that in 2016.
Turning to ÃlÃ©onore, this mine meets all the criteria we look for in great gold assets. It resides in one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. It has resource growth potential as far down as we have drilled. It is located in one of the newest most underexplored gold districts anywhere and we have a first mover advantage which we enhanced with the construction of a large scale processing plant. With higher dilution to compensate for the folding now factored into our guidance and reserves, the continued improvement in mine performance represents an important upside to ÃlÃ©onoreâs ramp schedule. The production shaft is on track for commissioning by the end of 2016 and underground development is progressing well to open up the bottom two of six mine horizons. Both of these milestones will be key to achieving nameplate capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day by the first half of 2018.
In the meantime, a $5 million exploration program is focused on the 494 zone at depth where we have the potential to covert significant resource to reserve. Target generation along this prolific trend is also underway.
At PeÃ±asquito, performance will continue to be driven largely by grades, so the priority there will remain on productivity and cost reduction as well as the advancement of Pyrite Leach Project for PLP. This study continues to demonstrate strong potential to recover gold and silver bound with pyrite that is currently going to the tailings. An invested decision is expected by mid-year. At Camino Rojo, near PeÃ±asquito, work continues towards an expected late 2016 completion of studies investigating a standalone heap leach operation of the of oxide resource.
At Red Lake, the first step toward enhancing NAV at this historic camp is optimizing and rationalizing what is a fairly disparate collection of infrastructure and mining zones. With five surface hafts, one internal shaft and two mills in our property for what is essentially a 2,000 per tonne per day operation, there appear to be significant scope for operating cost reduction beyond moving to the more efficient long-hole open stoping mining method which we have already done.
The HG Young discovery continues to be an important element of Red Lakeâs revitalization. Located just 1 kilometer from our existing Campbell complex, HG Young has a maiden high grade resource of almost 650,000 ounces with strong assays continuing to be received early in the year. We will leverage recently rehabilitated infrastructure at HG Young through additional underground development designed to touch the ore body at multiple points.
A concept study on HG Young is underway with an expected completion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Assuming a positive business case is determined from the concept study, a prefeasibility study will commence in mid-2017. Our objective is to securitize [ph] HG Young such that it allows Red Lake to maintain its grade profile as existing high grade zone reserve is expected to be exhausted by the end of the decade.
With Cochenour reverting to an exploration stage project and production from the project removed from our future forecast, we will conduct the program of further detailed drilling, drifting and sampling to improve our understanding of the geology. I understand the disappointment with the progress on this project, so we need to take a step back and get a better fundamental understanding of this geology to what we still believe will contribute meaningfully to Red Lakeâs production in the longer term. In 2016, we have budgeted $45 million on the these two projects and other exploration targets in the Red Lake camp.
The Porcupine camp represents another historic prolific operation that will benefit from the renewed focus on optimization efforts. With the closure of the Dome underground and expected depletion of the low grade stockpile by the middle of 2016, we will also conduct trade-off studies on the optimum processing plants for our Porcupine complex.
Following the March 2015 acquisition of the Borden project near Porcupine, drilling has successfully converted 860,000 ounces of a 2 million ounce inferred resource into gold reserve during the year. Our prefeasibility study is underway to further optimize this project with a focus on the synergies at our significant industrial complex already in place and nearby Timmins. We expect to complete this work in the first quarter of 2017.
Turning to the Pueblo Viejo joint venture, with the resolution of the oxygen plant compressor motor failures well underway, Barrick has outlined optimization initiatives designed to extract further value from the asset. Chief among these is the maximization of Quisqueya power station to the potential sale of excess power back to the Dominican Republic power grid. The joint venture is also investigating the potential to convert the plant from hedging fuel oil to liquefied natural gas to reduce exposure to oil prices.
Finishing up the asset view with Musselwhite, the team is positioned well to follow up on its great 2015 performance. My first impression of the mine is that in many ways, this is a model mine for the rest of our organization. It has dramatically driven down its cost, improved safety performance and consistently delivered on production and cost targets. In addition, it has exploration potential, reserve growth and is studying a potentially very high rate of return expansion. A feasibility study and a new you underground materials handling system is expected to be completed by the middle of 2016. Our $9 million exploration program is focused on infill drilling of the six mineralized horizons, a step out drilling along the West Limb expanding reserves down plunged in the Lynx and PQ Deeps.
Our primary focus continues to be the generation of free cash flow along the conceivable spectrum of metal prices. Through smart asset optimization, prudent capital allocation and consistent focus on cost management and productivity enhancements, we are well positioned to extend a recent strong cash flow trend in 2016 and beyond. Goldcorpâs large portfolio of gold focused long-lived mines in the attractive jurisdictions in the Americas remains unmatched in the industry.
I look forward to working hard with our people to unlock even more potential from this collection through focused exploration, innovation, and the application of exciting new technologies.
With that operator, weâll be pleased to take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Phil Russo from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Phil Russo
Firstly on Cochenour here and the ounces that youâve lost here, is that -- how can you get those back? Is it gold price driven or is it tighter drilling over time or is it just piloterâs reinterpretation where they wonât be able to come back into the plan?
George Burns
Hi. Itâs George. No, the ounces arenât lost; we still have those resources. And our focus essentially is better understanding the complexity of the deposit and developing a mine plan that we can determine the timing and the amount of production that we can get of Cochenour the Cochenour. And once we have that, weâll be including that in our production guidance. But at this point, we need some more time to continue the drilling to get some development done and to get initial test stopes. So, we have a plan underway, as we speak. By mid-year, weâll be executing that plan to get some development done and expect to have results this year to guide us towards what we have in a budget for next year.
Phil Russo
And the capital spent to-date at Cochenour there, as you look at it today, do you see that youâll have to redo much of that capital that youâve spent or how do you look at it?
Chuck Jeannes
When you look at the deployed capital thus far, it was really getting us access to do the exploration and that access also obviously sets us up for production infrastructure. I mean the key development has been the tram at the bottom of the deposit or near the bottom of the deposit from Campbell that gave us the initial drilling near the bottom of the resource. And then, weâve interconnected that with an upgraded Cochenour shaft. And because of that we now have access sort to the heart of the deposit where weâre actively doing work as we speak. And thatâs going to be the focus this year on continued drilling, some development, and setting ourselves up for the first test stoping. So, we continue to make progress on that. And as I said, we donât have any production in the guidance but as we get this work completed by year end, weâll have a lot better indication of what Cochenour is.
Phil Russo
Maybe just shifting to ÃlÃ©onore, I notice the grade came down here. Could you maybe just give us an update on the folding and faulting issues? I think last September we talked about it being 10% of the deposit here. Whatâs the dilution factor youâve included now in the new reserves, and is the folding and faulting still sort of limited in the area there, are you seeing it occur more frequently?
Chuck Jeannes
Weâre still projecting about 10% of the deposits to have that intense folding and faulting that is included in our updated resource and reserves. Dilutions in the 25% to 30% range and again thatâs included in our numbers. So, itâs as we discussed in the fall during the site visit.
Phil Russo
And then maybe just on Borden Lake here, see youâve moved it into reserves. I assume thereâs an operating cost number or trucking cost number there. As you look at Borden Lake, is it still sort of evolving the way you envisioned it? And maybe, can you share what your trucking assumptions are or operating cost assumptions in that reserve estimate?
Chuck Jeannes
Yes. Borden is evolving as we expected. Weâre happy to be reporting the initial reserves this year. Weâve had a lot of upside; weâll be focused on with continued exploration. And our concept in terms of processing remains unchanged that the trucking the ore up and utilizing the infrastructure at the Porcupine unit. Our assumption right now is about 35 bucks a ton for haulage from the Borden project up to the mill. And again, our focus is on expanding that reserve.
Operator
Thank you. And your following question will be from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton
Interesting results, probably the most common phrases that weâve heard over the last 24 hours or so is that itâs a kitchen sink result and the guidance is sandbagging. How would you respond to that?
David Garofalo
Well, I think weâve built in appropriate conservatism where we got operating difficulties in the past. And two striking examples would be the folding at ÃlÃ©onore and as George said we built in additional dilution for that in our reserves, in our production guidance. And we hope that as we get more experience with that deposits that weâll realize some upside over time. And obviously removing Cochenour at this stage is really change of philosophy in terms of how we include production ounces in the guidance of the future until theyâre fully engineered, until we have an economic case to make, we wonât be incorporating production ounces into our guidance in the future. So, that is the change in philosophy, itâs I think a more prudent way to guide production on a go forward basis, and it provides us some upside going forward from whatâs a rock solid 3 million ounce business.
David Haughton
So, from this level here of the guidance of about 2.8 million to 3.1 million ounces that youâve got basically the next three years or so, youâve got confidence to at least exceed that number? Is that your view, or is this a much beta basis to think about with the potential, if things go right to go above?
David Garofalo
Well, this is a level that we think we can sustain in the short to medium term. 3 million ounces, again, itâs a rock solid foundation from which we can grow incrementally from our internal pipeline of projects.
David Haughton
One of the things, David, you didnât speak about was PeÃ±asquito. Obviously, a fantastic year last year, and most of had the expectation that it was coming off. Just for a little bit of clarity. I saw in your slide there that your expectation for throughput for 2016 was 117,000 tons a day, through the mill that is. What should we be expecting as far as the grade profile goes? Iâve had a look for the technical reports; there was one in 2011 thatâs obviously quite obsolete. It was based at a higher level; it didnât really show any grade in â16 and the grades were somewhat irrelevant given the different mining rate. And then the release in 2014 simply didnât have any production. Can you give us something that we can see now as somewhat more reliable as far as your expectation going forward on the grade profile for the next few years which is where you saw the lower levels?
George Burns
Hi, David, itâs George. So, I mean this last year was a fantastic year, as PeÃ±asquito was very high grade. This year, weâre expecting the grade to be around 0.7 gram per ton. And when you look over the three-year plan, weâre in a lower grade and then the grade will come back up, after the three-year plan that weâve given guidance on. So, kind of see those performing as expected. Itâs a rock solid asset for us and it had a fantastic year last year, but thatâs a cornerstone mine for us for the long-term.
David Haughton
And that 0.7 level, George, would you expect for that to be reasonably steady for the next three years and then a bit of an uptick, as you get into a different phases of the pit?
George Burns
Itâs going to drop off after this year for two years and then comes back after that.
David Haughton
Okay. Drop down to the 0.6 something range orâ¦?
George Burns
Around 0.5 gram.
David Haughton
Okay. For two years. And then back up to what -- the 0.7 sort of thing?
George Burns
Weâll guide that later but it is going rebound after the three years.
David Haughton
And should we be assuming any contribution from the heap leach or just quite nominal?
George Burns
Nominal.
David Haughton
Okay. And as far as the costs are performing, noticed that we didnât have any guidance on a mine level cost. Iâm just wondering should we be thinking about similar kind of cost structure at these assets as what weâve seen in 2015 or should we be thinking about some adjustments; how would you guide us there?
George Burns
Iâd stick with similar. We didnât guide mine by mine this year.

The following question will be from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jorge Beristain
I guess maybe my question is for Chuck, just maybe on an outbound basis you could take this on. I know itâs a little bit of a loaded question, but Iâm just wondering has the Board done a review of what the returns have been on the sort of $10 billion on M&A and CapEx that you guys have spent over the past five years? Iâm just trying to understand if you guys understand the returns on capital of the money thatâs been spent.
Chuck Jeannes
Yes. The Board has looked at already. And the Board looks at lot of information internal to our business and their deliberationâs of course confidential.
Jorge Beristain
Okay, because my question is I think rough numbers, we can attribute about $5 billion of that spending in M&A to Cerro Verde. And based on the AISE that you just updated at $1,200 gold youâre generating about $400 of EBIT there. So, roughly, itâs a 4% return project over the past few years. Thatâs total return, not compounded. And what Iâm wondering is if the Board is going to really clamp down on future spending, until you guys have a better handle on really defining much better the kind of returns you can earn on a go-forward basis. This is something we see playing out with a lot of miners now talking about openly 15%, 20% return on capital employed projects going forward. But maybe this question is more for David. Do you have that kind of mindset coming in? Obviously you have a clean slate on a go-forward basis, but could you just talk a little bit about how you see incremental returns on each marginal dollar being spent going forward?
David Garofalo
Thanks Jorge for the question. Absolutely, net asset value accretion is by far the most important metric running our business and driving our business decisions. That means having a very strong fundamental understanding of what our cost of capital is and then setting appropriate hurdle rates for the various opportunities weâre evaluating. And those hurdles are not one size fits all. It really depends on stage of the project, it depends where itâs location and just the general risk profile. And weâll look at each of these projects individually on that basis. So absolutely, weâre looking to accrete NAV over time. Thatâs really whatâs going to drive our business decision and not trying to achieve an ounce target.
Jorge Beristain
And what do you consider your hurdle rate now?
David Garofalo
Again itâs not a one size fits all. And I think thatâs proprietary quite frankly depending on the opportunity but really depends on the risk profile of the individual opportunity, whether itâs in our backyard, whether itâs an opportunity thatâs Greenfield, Brownfield, where itâs located. You have to build an appropriate risk premium depending on the stage of the project in this location.

The next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes
Thank you. David, when youâve had a chance to look through the portfolio now, are you happy with the organic project portfolio you have or do you see opportunities or reasons to add to it?
David Garofalo
No. I have to say, Greg, I was pleasantly surprised by how many projects we had internally. Having gone through a massive build out as Goldcorp has, my expectation was that if things were built out and already optimized but there is still opportunities Brownfield expansion opportunities, exploration opportunities internally and I think that will allow us to compound returns for the foreseeable future. I think we have a steady guide of project catalysts over the next couple of years, which I think is quite exciting for our shareholders.
Greg Barnes
So, you donât feel a need to go out there and acquire something?
David Garofalo
No. Our focus is very much internally on the opportunities we have. We think that will afford us plenty of opportunity to grow our production, grow our NAV more importantly over the next several years.
Greg Barnes
Just going back to Cochenour, youâve had several months now to review it again. George, what are the complexities there; what is it that surprised you; what do you need to figure it out?
George Burns
I mean Cochenour, we got access basically to do the definition drilling. And so that drilling thatâs been completed thus far, the mineralization is different from what was projected from the vertical drilling done by our predecessor. So, really, itâs a Red Lake high grade ore body that has negative effect. And so, itâs really focused infill drilling, has some test stopes in place. And once we have that to be able to develop a production profile thatâs reliable and we can all hang our hat on.
Greg Barnes
So, that sounds like youâre not finding the continuity then that you thought you were going to get.
George Burns
Itâs different than we expected.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
Q - John Tumazos
The four most recent projects of the Company were overcapitalized and overcapacity. But the money is in place and clearly youâre going to do your best exploring. Is the strategy going to be to run those things hard and keep the mills full and just let them be six to eight-year life projects so that the NPV is maximized?
David Garofalo
Well, NPV maximization and running your mills at full capacity arenât necessarily mutually inclusive. And Iâll give you an example, at Porcupine for example, we have a 12,000 tonne a concentrator at two lines 8,000 and 4,000 tonnes a day. And we are running out of sources of ore -- we have less sources of ore, we are not running out but we are at less source of ore with the Dome Underground shutting down and with the surface stockpile being exhausted by the middle of this year. And what we could do is run the Hollinger pit and Hoyle very hard to fill the 8,000 tonne a day line or we could run the 4,000 tonne a day the line, be more discerning on grade and stockpile material. And thatâs one of the trade-off settings weâre doing. And what would drive that decision ultimately is what generates the best net present value. And Iâm using that as an example but thatâs the philosophy we intend to apply across our business. Itâs really whatâs going to drive and an impressive value to maximum levels in our operations rather than try to fill infrastructure.
John Tumazos
If we take PeÃ±asquito, because itâs the biggest project, and the mill is 130,000 tonnes a day, the ore is a little less now. Are you still going to run at 130,000 tonnes a day and do the Northern Well Field and try to get it done and be finished and move on, as quick as you can? 
George Burns
Well, you are right, the PeÃ±asquito mill is capable of 130,000 a day, but the constrain is the mine right now. So that 117,000 thatâs in our plan for this year is based on the ore, the mine we deliver.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni
Good afternoon, gentlemen. First off, Chuck, I wanted to congratulate you on your retirement and wish you all the best. I think this industry has been better off with you as a proponent and youâve provided a safe harbor for a lot of gold investors through turbulent times. So, I wanted to thank you for that.
Chuck Jeannes
Thanks Anita.
Anita Soni
The hard question goes to Dave, I think. So, capital budget, as we look out towards replacement of reserves in 2019 and beyond, what should we be thinking about in terms of growth? I know you have not guided for it but should we be using $100 million that youâre budgeting for this year?
David Garofalo
No, I mean that $100 million is really a fairly discreet amount associated with this year to bring these projects through various phases of study. As we bring them to an investment decision, we will be providing more fulsome guidance on the capital expenditures for those projects, the rate of returns, the expected impact on production. So, really you have to look at each of these projects individually and then the goal across the spectrum of capital intensity. Generally theyâre relatively low capital intensity to what weâve just gone through but there is a broad spectrum of project scale here. And we will be able to provide more fulsome guidance to you as we bring them to an investment decision, an AFE for our Board.
Anita Soni
And then, in terms of M&A, just to address an updated outlook on your comments earlier from the year, you talked a lot about organic opportunities on this call. Could you address where the non-organic opportunities sit in your pecking order?
David Garofalo
I would say our focus is very inward right now, having spent a lot couple of months serving our opportunities both internally and externally. I would say the best opportunities are the ones that we have internally. Obviously weâll keep our heads in the game and watch whatâs going on in the market. But we think we have the best opportunities for growth for growing NAV within our existing portfolio and our existing pipeline.
Anita Soni
And then the last question I think is for George. On PeÃ±asquito, is that the key driver for why the costs are -- I guess, prior expectations are just with ramp ups at these newer assets, albeit at a slower pace but still, was expecting costs to go down in 2017 to 2018. So, is the grade declined at PeÃ±asquito is the primary driver of those costs remaining flat in the outer years?
George Burns
Yes, the grades driving the ounces down is the big driver on a cost per ounce basis. We also have -- sustaining capital is a bit high this year in particular.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Walker from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen Walker
Just a couple of questions, first on PeÃ±asquito. The NEP process sounds like itâs being put on the back burner for now. And my understanding is the penalties for copper and the lead and the zinc concentrates are significantly lower than had been expected. Do you think this is a short-term phenomenon or is there something changing in the ore body itself that allows you to generate concentrates that are not attracting a penalty over the next three or four years?
George Burns
This is a really good new story for us. The concentrate marketing has improved significantly. So, the requirement to invest capital to clean up the concentrate is no long there. So, the copper, the arsenic and the antimony thatâs in the concentrate is -- the market conditions at the smelters are positive now. So that investment no longer makes sense.
Stephen Walker
And the PLP process, my understanding it was going to be the bulk of the capital cost of the roughly $950 million that was originally estimated. Do you have a capital estimate at this time you are comfortable with for the PLP process?
David Garofalo
We will be publishing a feasibility study on that towards the middle of the year, so weâre going to hold off on that and then weâll provide a definitive guidance on that incremental capital, and the impact from its production profile.
Stephen Walker
And just Camino Rojo, you now talk about it as potential supplemental source of feed for PeÃ±asquito. Is the heap leach still being considered or are you now looking at a larger operation where you are focused on primary ore in addition to heap leach or what do I read into that wording, if anything?
George Burns
Weâre still focused on getting an oxide standalone heap leach project engineered and that work will be finished in around end of this year. In terms of the sulphide, itâs still sitting there at higher metal prices, and itâs something weâll continue to look at.
Stephen Walker
And just one last question on Red Lake, if I might, youâve made the transition from cut-and-fill to long-hole at the Red Lake Deep. Can you talk a little bit about, first of all, ground control? I know that there was some ground control issues several years ago, the seismic activity, rock burst and so forth. Whatâs the ground like down there; how are you managing that? And just out of curiosity, what is the split for that 2,000 tonnes a day between what youâre pulling from the Campbell remnants and then the Red Lake Deep? And again, how long can you be mining the Campbell remnants and pulling pillars before youâre focused 100% on the Red Lake Deep?
George Burns
To start with the high grade zone, seismicity is as itâs been in the past. Itâs something that we are pretty good at managing. And in fact, weâve improved our ability to mitigate that with tele-remote capabilities. Weâre able to muck and grow when there is seismicity because we donât have to put people in there. So, weâve got better mitigation today than we had two years ago. And Iâd characterize the seismicity is a challenge as itâs always been. In terms of Campbell, at Campbell we can stay for couple of years, itâs continuing to ramp down. Itâs a small part of our production profile in this three year plan. And really the focus at Red Lake is ramping up lower Red Lake area with both mining. And lot of that area have been done narrow vein mining. And so, weâve done the mechanization thatâs more bulk mining lower costs. So, when you look at our three year plan, itâs really to focus on more bulk mining, not only in the high grade zone but also in the lower Red Lake area and Campbell kind of fading away.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mike Parkin from Desjardins. Please go ahead.
Mike Parkin
A couple of questions around the reserves. Obviously weâve seen you go to $1,100 on the gold price. I was just wondering what the thought process there was. Do you consider spot at all because on the other metals youâre above spot, or how did you go about picking those prices?
David Garofalo
One of the moving targets, Mike, as you can imagine when we start the reserve calculations, as you know, itâs very labor intensive, block models are very manually done. And we had to set a price that was realistic in light of the market the time which in mid-December was in the mid $1,000 to $1,100 range. So, we thought a prudent long-term price would be about 1,100 that was a little bit above spot at the time. And we still think thatâs good prudent long-term pricing. It also drove a lot of low margin ounces out of our reserves and you saw our reserve grade go up. So that was the thinking that went into 1,100. Of course we have to review this on a regular basis, both for reserve calculation, but as we evaluate capital investment opportunities internally and externally. And so from time to time, we will reset the price.
Mike Parkin
Just for an example, not to single it out, but Los Filos where you probably lost a lot of low-grade tonnes there, is there any thought with -- in markets where we are today that you would actually process some of those lower-grade tonnes, even though theyâre not in reserves, and minimize depletion of reserves or would you aim more towards stockpiling it and the aim that if we are in better gold price days, down the road you could use it as an end of mine life processing pile?
George Burns
So, Los Filos open pit is not an important part of our production profile in our guidance but there is a lot of resource setting there. And to you point with higher metal prices, it becomes more interesting to bring that back into the plan. Weâll be focusing on cost reductions. Part of what drove that reserve drop at Filos was we had a very larger pushback and weâve had some slope stability challenges with the current pits and looking at this major pushback in the large wall that would have been there with increased geotechnical work we laid that slope angle back. So that also hurt us on the cost side and had an impact on the Filos reserve dropping up significantly. So, weâll continue to focus on costs, continue to assess geotechnical constraints and at higher metal prices at some point the Filos pit would comeback. Weâll just continue to look at that.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Brian Yu from Citi. Please go ahead.
Brian Yu
So, my question is on Cochenour; I know there have been plenty asked already. But, when I look at it, you guys have downgraded a couple of steps to advance exploration, even though it seems like a significant portion of the capital has already been spent on the infrastructure. Can you remind us how much capital is remaining in the prior 2016 budget for Cochenour? And as we think about it going forward, is it really just a matter of doing more drilling, making sure you understand the mineralization, and so, in terms of bring it back to the stages of your feasibility and back into construction, that will be fairly quick?
George Burns
The focus again is infill drilling, reinterpretation of the mineralization based on that drilling, and then putting in some cells, testing the continuity and then put an initial test open place. So that is our focus. Weâre working on a plan by midyear, be executing that in the second half of the year. And the results from that will set us up with the better understanding of what might be in the three-year plan a year from now. And in terms of the infrastructure, we have what we need. Weâve got dilation, weâve got access to the surface through the upgraded Cochenour shaft, weâve got the tram levels established. So really the incremental capital is selling additional ramp development and adding ventilation depending on the amount of production, we also need to get ore passes put in down to the tram level, if we proceed with large tonnages. The initial work will be done second half of this year, we will be hoisting it up due to Cochenour shaft as we better define the project. And so, yes, the bulk of the capital has been spent to set us up, not just for the exploration weâre doing but for material movement.
Brian Yu
Do you recall what the capital budget would have been in â16, had you continued to move forward with it?
Russell Ball
Brian, itâs Russ. My recollection was commercial production in the third quarter and somewhere around 70 million to get what exchange rate that was when we did the â15 budget but $70 million U.S. is my recollection through commercial production.
David Garofalo
Brian, to be clear, what weâre budgeting this year is about a third of our exploration is in the Red Lake camp of 45 million of the 135 million and so that incorporates work on Cochenour.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Quail
I suppose a lot of the questions have been asked; mine more sort of a high level. I suppose when you look at some of you peers globally, not just in North America, theyâve been selling assets or divesting assets to -- and shrinking the profitability and free cash flow per share. I mean, Dave, when you look at the portfolio you inherited now, is there anything there that you can see that might not make sense, is the next 12 months? Youâve given us a range for the next three years and itâs flat and thatâs fine with most people. But my second question is about costs. If you guys, given you are an emerging market producer pretty much, including Canada, hopefully the currency headwinds and the energy -- sorry currency tailwinds and the energy tailwinds could see that you guys should be able to beat your costs that you had last quarter over the next three years. I would just look to see if you guys could comment on those two things. So, one on the divestitures, and two on your costs.
David Garofalo
I mean, there probably a couple of elements of conservatism in our cost, just to answer your second question first, and one is we did use a long-term Canadian exchange rate of 120 and a Mexican peso to U.S. of 14.5. So if Canadian dollar, Mexican peso stays at these levels there is certainly some opportunity for cost efficiencies there. As I mentioned earlier on, we havenât baked in any of the Brownfield expansion in any of our projects. So, as a result, there may be some economies of scale, some cost efficiencies that will be a realized over time as we drive up to production rates at these projects and we invest additional capital or incremental capital into them.
And sorry, on the first questionâ¦
Andrew Quail
Divestitures, youâve seen your peers obviously outperform. And no one is really asking for step change growth; itâs just more -- itâs not just in the North America, itâs globally. The guys are actually taking out ounces but their share prices go higher. And now you guys are over these [indiscernible] comp. Itâs like do you have to own everything that you own right now?
David Garofalo
You know what, nobodyâs divested assets better than Chuck and his team has historically and Iâve often complimented to Chuck long before this job in my sites, about his ability to reallocate capital on a disciplined basis from assets that have probably seen better days or didnât move the needle. And I think weâll continue that cost and evaluation of our portfolio. And if a thing doesnât meet our return on capital criteria, doesnât have the prospect for NAV growth over time, thatâs probably the right time to sell it. And so we will continue to look at things through that lens within our existing portfolio.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni
Sorry. I couldnât escape without a question on dilution. So, in terms of Cochenour dilution, if we were looking at the inferred, what kind of dilution would you be considering when you are bringing it into the reserve category?
George Burns
Yes, I mean until we get the plans put together and then initial stope Iâd be speculating, itâs going to be a long-hole mining method. So, you can use general long-hole mining dilution rate to this one.
Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. Mr. Jeannes, you may proceed.
Chuck Jeannes
Okay. Thank you, operator. I Just wanted to say to everybody, itâs been very gratifying to watch as this Company has grown over last nine years. Itâs also been a pleasure to share our successes and even our challenges with so many of you on the line today. It can be a difficult business as we all know, especially on days like today. But when it works best, when our people go home safely after shift, when a kid can be the first in his family to attend college because of an economic opportunity that we provided, itâs a greatest and most gratifying business in the world. And Iâm very pleased to be a part of it. I love being a part of this sector. And Iâm sure I wonât be leaving it completely. So, to our shareholders, other investors and analysts, thank you all for your support and friendship. I have really enjoyed getting to know you. And I look forward to crossing paths again in the future. And as a committed Goldcorp shareholder, I look forward to joining you all on this line on the next quarter but on the other side of the conference call line. So, thanks very much and good bye.
Operator
Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you all for your participation.
