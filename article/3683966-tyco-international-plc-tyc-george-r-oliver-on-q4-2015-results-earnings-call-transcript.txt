Welcome to Tyco's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Your lines have been placed on listen only until the question-and-answer session.
And I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Antonella Franzen - Head-Investor Relations
Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Tyco's fourth quarter and full-year results for fiscal year 2015 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are Tyco's Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; our Chief Financial Officer, Arun Nayar; and Robert Olson, who will be succeeding Arun as CFO following the filing of our Form 10-K, which we expect to do later today.
I would like to remind you that during the course of today's call, we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask that you read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides which George and Arun will refer to can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we changed the name of our North America Installation & Services and the Rest of World Installation & Services segments to North America Integrated Solutions & Services and Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services to better reflect our focus on providing technology-enabled solutions that are tailored to our customers' needs. There was no change in the underlying segment structure and no impact to previously disclosed segment information.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency and divestitures. Additionally, references to operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Also, I would like to remind everyone that beginning in fiscal 2016, we will be including restructuring and repositioning within our reported earnings per share before special items. As we are now three years out from the separation, we have completed the bulk of the restructuring and repositioning actions related to that transaction. Our view of a normal run rate for these charges is approximately $75 million on an annual basis.
Given the current economic environment, our guidance for 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million, or $0.14 to $0.19 of restructuring and repositioning charges. These charges will be shown as a separate line item below segment operating income to allow greater visibility to the underlying segment results. We have recast the quarters of fiscal 2015 to include restructuring and repositioning charges as well as the related tax impact in the appendix to the slides.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results. Revenue in the quarter of $2.5 billion declined 7% year over year on a reported basis, driven by a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. The favorable impact of net acquisition and divestiture activity was offset by a 1% organic revenue decline.
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco ordinary shareholders was $0.19 and included net charges of $0.42 related to special items. These special items related primarily to restructuring and repositioning charges as well as a charge for the early retirement of debt. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.61 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.
Now, let me turn the call over to George.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Antonella, and good morning, everyone.
This was a solid quarter of operational execution. Our continued focus on productivity and self-help initiatives across all of the businesses and global functions drove our operating results this quarter. Overall, fiscal 2015 was a challenging year. Macro headwinds coupled with the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar have put significant pressure on our results this year.
Our team stepped up to the challenge and aggressively executed cost actions and accelerated our pipeline of restructuring initiatives to help mitigate the pressure and drive strong earnings growth both for the fourth quarter and for the year. I am very proud of how our teams came together, and thank them for their leadership.
Starting on slide four, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment and our expectations for fiscal 2016. Overall, the global industrial economy has come under increased pressure over the last few months. Although pockets of strength exist in certain verticals, many markets directly or indirectly exposed to commodity-linked resources continue to be sluggish.
Starting with North America, the U.S. market remains a relative bright spot, with continued growth in non-residential construction year over year. We continue to see increased activity over prior-year levels, with strength in the commercial, retail, and institutional verticals. As expected, Western Canada remains weak, as the market is very much tied to the petrochemical oil and gas industry.
Overall, our North America Integrated Solutions & Services business performed very well in the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 2%, and the operating margin continued to expand. When I reflect back on the last three years, this business has been through significant changes. Although the top line has remained relatively flat on an organic basis, the operating margin before special items improved by 480 basis points to an annual rate of 15.3%, and operating income increased 43% over this period. This far exceeded the expectations set three years ago to achieve an operating margin of 13% to 14%. Even more importantly, our work is not done. We are investing in the business while continuing to improve the efficiency of our operations.
Moving to Rest of World, let me start with Europe. In general, the environment remains sluggish. GDP estimates continue to be revised downward due to economic uncertainty. Overall, our European businesses have executed well despite softness on the top line. Our operating margins have been improving as the teams are executing productivity initiatives to reduce our cost structure and drive operational efficiencies. With that being said, we anticipate relatively flat revenue growth in Europe in 2016 on a year-over-year basis.
In Australia, the industrial and mining sector downturn continues to dampen overall industrial activity in the region. This macro environment has persisted throughout 2015, and we are planning for a similar environment in 2016. In the growth markets, we continue to see growth in the mid-single-digit range, and expect this to continue in fiscal 2016.
Despite the economic conditions in Latin America, our business, which represents approximately 5% of sales, had solid performance, with about 10% organic growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015.
Given the impact the oil and gas vertical has had on our results this year, I'd like to take a minute to update you on our performance during the quarter and for the full year. In aggregate, our oil and gas businesses were down about 20% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and down 15% on a full-year basis, both in line with our previous expectations. Despite representing only about 5% of sales, the mix impact associated with the decline in this vertical created a $0.06 EPS headwind in fiscal 2015.
As we continue to the next phase of our journey, we remain intently focused on disciplined growth and continuous operational improvement. Disciplined growth is focused on ensuring that we provide products and services that our customers value and are willing to pay a premium for, whether it's the products we sell through our distribution channels or the technology embedded in our integrated solutions and services that are delivered by our direct channel. We are a leader in many of the markets we serve, as a combination of our brands, technology and reliability make us a premium player in the fire and security industry.
Innovation is at the heart of everything we do. We live in a world where senses and devices are gathering increased volumes of data which creates opportunities for improved analytics that help our clients improve operations, keep customers safe, safeguard their facilities, and comply with codes and standards. We no longer consider our total addressable market to be limited to the fire and security industry when developing new products and services. We are now looking at the total customer problem and how our resources, devices and our factories in the field can help create solutions to solve these problems.
Every customer process, every customer building, every customer business needs data for continuous improvement. The right real-time data leads to the operational insights customers need to optimize performance. For example, the combination of our store performance solutions with our creative systems and FootFall acquisitions provides a full view of inventory, traffic, and other analytics to fundamentally change the retailer's operations. Retailers can plan better around store hours, figure out when to restock their stores, lead customers directly to inventory on the shelves, and upsell them more effectively when they choose to try on clothes. The combination of our investments, along with the changes made to the sales team to better align to our strategy, has resulted in a mid-single-digit increase in our retail business in fiscal 2015.
Although this is only a piece of our portfolio, it lays the path of what can be done across the enterprise. This requires making the right decisions around resource allocation, as well as making smart investments in R&D and sales and marketing. Over the past three years, we have been focused on streamlining operations. While we will continue doing so, we are shifting to driving commercial excellence across the portfolio.
We are making incremental investments in 2016 to drive productivity in our sales force. We have just initiated a global program to create a commercial ecosystem using salesforce.com to align all Tyco employees around the customer and drive a superior customer experience. The program is called E3, which stands for Everyone sells, Everyone serves, Everyone helps. E3 will allow 30,000 customer-facing team members to collaborate around a 360 degree view of our customers, and for our customers to have a more seamless experience with Tyco. E3 is being rolled out in phases over the next two years and will be the foundation for commercial excellence.
Shifting to continuous improvement, the combination of our productivity initiatives, along with the additional restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2015, position us to increase our expected gross savings to approximately $180 million to $210 million in 2016.These savings are expected to be somewhat offset by wage inflation costs of approximately $60 million.
Additionally, we expect to increase our incremental investments for R&D and sales and marketing initiatives to a range of $70 million to $90 million. As the incremental growth savings will fund these increased investments, we still expect to deliver a $50 million to $60 million benefit to the bottom line. We will continue to supplement these internal growth initiatives with strategic acquisitions.
During fiscal 2015, we committed about $575 million of capital for acquisitions, which we expect to yield approximately $300 million of revenue on an annualized basis. We continue to actively work a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities, with a few transactions in the near-term which could total $200 million and $500 million in purchase price.
In addition to acquisitions, we continued to review the portfolio. We recently made a decision to divest a business which manufacturers piping components within our Global Products segment. This business generated approximately $45 million in revenue in fiscal 2015. Additionally, share repurchase remains an important component of our capital allocation strategy. We currently have a $1-billion authorization in place. Our current plan is to offset dilution, at a minimum, and potentially repurchase additional shares if cash builds up on the balance sheet and there is no acquisition activity.
Now let me turn it over to Arun to go over the details of our performance.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. You can follow my comments on our financial performance starting with slide six. Beginning with our full year results, revenue of $9.9 billion grew 1% organically. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures added an additional point to revenue growth which more than offset â which was more than offset by a 6% headwind from changes in foreign currency for an overall revenue decline of 4%. In total, segment operating margin before special items expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. The margin expansion was led by North America Integrated Solutions & Services, which expanded margins by 200 basis points, helping to offset the margin pressure in Rest of World and Global Products.
Earnings per share before special items increased 12% in 2015, led by strong operations, including aggressive cost actions which together contributed $0.17 of incremental earnings year over year, despite the tougher than expected macro environment.
Now focusing on the quarter, please turn to slide 8. Revenue of $2.5 billion declined 7% year over year on a reported basis, including a 7% headwind from changes in foreign currency. In line with our expectation, organic revenue declined 1%. Acquisitions contributed two percentage points of revenue growth, which was partially offset by our 1% decline related to the impact of a divestiture. Excluding FX, Service was up 3%, Integrated Solutions declined 3%, and Global Products grew 5%. Before special items, segment operating income was $394 million and the segment operating margin improved 150 basis points to 15.7%. The year-over-year operating margin expansion was driven by improved execution and the benefits from cost actions, restructuring and productivity initiatives. Overall, earnings per share before special items increased 9% year over year.
Turning to orders on slide 9, as I've mentioned in previous quarterly calls, it is important to keep in mind that order growth particularly in our Integrated Solutions business is lumpy and can be impacted by the timing of large projects. Overall, orders increased 3% year over year, with 10% growth in Products, 2% growth in Service and a 1% decline in Integrated Solutions. Total backlog of $4.6 billion increased 3% on a year-over-year basis and was flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Now, let's get into the details of each of the segments, starting first with North America Integrated Solutions & Services on slide 10. Revenue in the quarter of $1 billion was flat on a reported basis. Organic revenue growth of 2% was fully offset by the negative impact of the weaker Canadian dollar. We saw nice growth in service revenue, which increased close to 3% organically in the quarter. Additionally, Integrated Solutions grew 1% organically.
Before special items, operating income in the quarter was $180 million and the operating margin was 17.8%. The operating margin improved 460 basis points year over year. The prior year included a $10 million legal charge which resulted in 100 basis point tailwind to the year-over-year operating margin expansion.
Additionally, the current year benefited from discrete items which favorably impacted the operating margin by approximately 120 basis points. Underlying margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by increased revenue, improved execution, and the benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives. As George mentioned, we have made significant changes in our North America Integrated Solutions & Services business and we are seeing the benefits of those changes in the margin expansion.
As I've discussed on last quarter's call, orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 benefited from several large orders, resulting in a difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As expected, overall orders decreased 4% year over year in North America Integrated Solutions & Services. Service orders increased 3% and Integrated Solutions orders decreased 11% off an 18% increase last year. Order activity this year was driven by the commercial, retail, and government verticals.
As we look to the first quarter, it's important to keep in mind that we have another tough compare in order activity, as last year's Q1 Integrated Solutions orders increased 13%, driven by several large projects. Total backlog of $2.5 billion increased 2% year over year and, in line with normal seasonality, declined 1% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to slide 11, Rest of World Integrated Solutions & Services revenue of $827 million decreased 18% year over year, driven by a 13% unfavorable impact from FX. Organic revenue declined 3%, driven by a 7% decline in Integrated Solutions, partly due to a tough compare of 7% growth in the prior year as well as pressure in the UK and the Asia-Pacific regions, mainly from the oil and gas vertical. Acquisitions contributed 2% to revenue growth, which was more than offset by the impact of a divestiture.
Before special items, operating income was $90 million. The segment operating margin declined 90 basis points year over year to 10.9%, as the benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives were more than offset by the volume deleverage and the mix of geographies contributing to operating income.
Turning to order activity in Rest of World, we saw a nice improvement in order intake. Year over year, total orders increased 6%, with 1% growth in Service and an 11% increase in Integrated Solutions, which included several large orders in Latin America and Asia. Backlog of $1.9 billion grew 4% on a year-over-year basis and 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Turning to Global Products on slide 12, revenue declined 2% on both a reported and organic basis to $666 million. A 7% benefit to revenue from acquisitions was fully offset by a 7% decrease in revenue from FX. The organic revenue decline resulted from a slowdown in the U.S. fire market as well as significant decrease in demand in the Middle East related to the oil and gas vertical, each of which negatively impacted our Life Safety business.
Before special items, operating income was $124 million and the operating margin declined 60 basis points to 18.6%. Productivity initiatives were more than offset by volume deleverage and mix, as well as an 80 basis point impact from non-cash purchase accounting. Product orders increased 10% year over year, primarily due to recent acquisitions.
Now let me touch on a few other items on slide 13. First, corporate expense before special items was $45 million for the quarter. This is about $10 million lower than we had expected and was offset by a $10 million increase in other expense. Corporate expense for the full year was $201 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.
Next, our effective tax rate before the impact of special items was 17.4% for the quarter and 16% for the year, driven by a one-time benefit recorded in the second quarter related to the realization of certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets. As we look forward to fiscal 2016, we expect the tax rate before special items to be in the range of 17% to 18%.
Moving to cash flow, we had a strong conversion quarter with adjusted free cash flow of $339 million, representing 130% conversion rate. We have made significant progress in the last six months converting our income to cash. However, the weaker than normal conversion in the first half of the year takes our full-year adjusted free cash flow of $761 million to a conversion rate of 80%. As we look ahead to 2016, we fully expect to be back to the 90% to 100% conversion rate for adjusted free cash flow.
Moving to restructuring and repositioning activities, we incurred charges of $120 million for the quarter and $289 million for the year, of which $176 million related to restructuring actions. These actions primarily related to severance and other employee-related charges, with an expected payback within two years. These and past restructuring and repositioning actions along with our strong productivity initiatives have offset the weaker macro environment and have been a strong contributor to our double-digit EPS growth this year.
As Antonella mentioned, beginning in 2016 our EPS before special items will include restructuring and repositioning charges. Our expectation for restructuring and repositioning charges for 2016 based on our current outlook is $75 million to $100 million, with approximately $20 million expected to be included in our first quarter results.
Before I turn it back over to George, let me provide you a quick update on our recent debt refinancing, which is detailed on slide 14. In September we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and raised $1.5 billion of debt. Half was issued with a 10-year term at an annual interest rate of 3.9% and the other half has a 30-year term at an annual rate of 5.125%. All the proceeds were used to redeem several tranches of higher interest rate debt, pay make-whole payments for the early redemption, and repay debt that matured in October 2015.
During the course of the year and including the recent debt refinancing, we increased our long-term debt by $700 million to $2.2 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. Despite our higher debt balance, we expect to reduce net interest expense in 2016 to approximately $80 million. Additionally, we expanded the capacity under our credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and extended the term five years out through 2020.
Now let me turn things back over to George.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Arun. Let's turn now to slide 15 for our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016.
Let me begin by noting that the uncertainty created by the macroeconomic environment, particularly in our international markets, has resulted in a more cautious outlook for 2016. Additionally, the headwind created by lower oil prices has kept pressure on customer CapEx budgets and OpEx spend, including continued deferral of discretionary maintenance.
Based on the timing of the decline in our results in 2015, which began at the tail-end of our fiscal second quarter, we expect our fiscal 2016 results to reflect low double-digit declines in our oil and gas vertical on a year-over-year basis. Although underlying activity may still be subdued throughout fiscal 2016, our year-over-year comparisons ease significantly in the back half.
With that in mind, let's get into the details of our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect total revenue to be in a range of $9.65 billion to $9.85 billion, with organic revenue growth being flat to up 2% year over year. We expect to start the year with an organic revenue decline given the compares with fiscal 2015, but we expect to see the growth rate pick up, particularly in the second half of the year. Included in our full-year revenue guidance is a $310 million or 3% headwind related to FX and the net benefit of recent acquisitions and divestitures of approximately $30 million.
The overall segment margin before special items for 2016 is expected to expand 50 basis points to 80 basis points year over year.
As Arun mentioned, our EPS before special items guidance for fiscal 2016 includes a range of $75 million to $100 million for restructuring and repositioning charges. Based on these items and the specific guidance Arun provided for corporate expense and below the line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.20, based on a weighted average share count of 427 million shares. This compares to fiscal 2015 EPS before special items of $1.74, which has been recast to include restructuring and repositioning charges of $289 million.
Historically, our EPS before special items has been stronger in the second half of the year through the seasonality of our businesses. We expect this to continue in 2016. However, given the oil and gas and FX comps we are facing in the first half, we expect our earnings to be a bit more skewed to the second half in fiscal 2016.
Now, let's shift to our guidance for the first quarter. Based on the factors just outlined, we expect that the first quarter will be our most difficult comparison of the year from both a reported and organic revenue standpoint as well as a segment margin perspective.
Turning to slide 16, our first quarter fiscal 2015 recast EPS before special items was $0.38. Let me walk you through our year-over-year earnings growth. First, the prior year included $75 million of restructuring and repositioning charges, which when tax-effected equates to $0.11 of EPS versus our expectation of $20 million of charges or $0.04 of EPS in the first quarter of 2016. Year over year, this results in a tailwind of $0.07.
Next, the first quarter of last year did not reflect any negative impact in our oil and gas vertical. We expect this will be a $0.02 headwind year over year.
Third, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen throughout fiscal 2015, resulting in an FX headwind of $0.03 year over year in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in volume and unfavorable mix is expected to be a $0.03 headwind year over year, which will be fully offset by the net savings in the quarter.
Overall, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items of approximately $0.40 in the first quarter of 2016.
Before the operator opens up the line for questions, I want to take a few minutes to thank Arun for his hard work and dedication over the last eight years at Tyco. Arun has led us through the separation and has been our Chief Financial Officer since 2012. Arun was integral in launching the new Tyco and taking us through many acquisitions, divestitures and capital market transactions, all while leading the transformation of our finance function.
Arun and I have worked closely together over the last three years, and I want to take this opportunity, with our shareholders and analysts, to say thank you. Thank you, Arun, for your commitment, candor and leadership, and I wish you all the best as you retire at the end of the year.
As many of you are aware, Arun is 65 and we have been planning a transition over the last year. While we will all miss Arun, I am happy to welcome Robert Olson, who'll be succeeding Arun as our Chief Financial Officer.
Previously, Robert was CFO of DISH Network, a provider of satellite video services and technology, where he served as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for five years. Robert also has vast experience in the commercial space, which he gained during his time as Chief Financial Officer of Trane Commercial Systems, the largest operating division of American Standard, from 2006 to 2008.
I am pleased to welcome such an accomplished financial executive to our senior leadership team. Robert's experience as a Chief Financial Officer, combined with his broad experience in service-oriented technology companies, will be especially valuable as we grow our Services and Solutions businesses.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks, good morning.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Nigel.
Antonella Franzen - Head-Investor Relations
Good morning, Nigel.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just wanted to dig into the 1Q guidance. Just going to the bridge, first of all, you normally give a range, and this time you've given us more of a point estimate. I'm just wondering. Does that reflect a degree of confidence in $0.40-plus? And then just digging into the $0.03 from volume, the $0.03 negative. It looks like that's based on a 3% decline. I just wondered if you could confirm that, please.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
When we look at the first quarter, Nigel, it's probably the most difficult compare that we've had as the new Tyco, when you look at not only the currency headwinds, it's going to be our most difficult quarter. We've got â we've got the product mix that's coming through both our Fire Protection Products as well as our Life Safety Products, and that, therefore, that's going to create a mix issue. And then our overall products we're projecting right now to be down kind of mid single digits, and that is where a lot of the pressure is coming. Now, that all being said, we've been able to drive the productivity and cost out actions, have been able to more than offset the FX headwind that we're getting, to be able to maintain relatively flat margin rates in spite of the purchase price accounting that we're seeing year on year.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So the products down mid-single digits in 1Q. Maybe you could broaden that out in terms of what you're expecting by segment. But before we get into that, just wondering, you mentioned weakness in U.S. fire products, within products, and you've consistently talked about fire as a leading indicator for the North American business. So I'm wondering does the weakness in U.S. fire indicate a broader weakening in the demand in North America.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Nigel, the U.S. fire service pressure that we saw is really the compare that we have within our Life Safety business. As you recall last year, we had the X3 launch, and then as that played out, we had a surge in output during the course of â it was actually during the course of 2014, and that continued in the early part of 2015. Now, that being said, during the course of the fourth quarter, we did see a little bit of weakness come through. That all being said, I would say that the orders that we're seeing today are very strong, and that's projecting to not only support the volume that we're committing in the first quarter but beyond within the rest of the year.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks, George. And before I go, I just want to say thanks to Arun and enjoy your retirement.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats, Arun.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning, Jeff. Thank you.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Yes. George or Arun, could we kind of talk a little bit about what's going on in service? I mean there's a hint of an inflection going on there, but I don't know if it's just some lumpiness. It would seem like maybe the delayed reaction of the project selectivity may have run its course, and some of that downward pressure on service, therefore, may have run its course. Can you just elaborate on what you'd see going on in the service portfolio and kind of the margin construct within that and how we should think about that going into 2016?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Let me start, Jeff, by saying that we've had a lot of focus in how we're building out our commercial capabilities with our sales force, with our footprint, and we continue to invest in expanding that. That has played a big role in our ability to be able to now start to see progress on the latter part of the year, and then as we project 2016. I would say, when you look at the overall growth in 2015, we achieved about â it was about a half a point of growth with the four quarter being up â was up about 1%, so we are starting to see momentum. As we look at not only the investments we're making, the increased install base, the new service that is we're launching, we expect to be positioned to deliver about 2% service growth in 2016.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
And is there anything to add about the embedded margins in the backlog or in the service portfolio as we think about 2016?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Jeff, we stay very disciplined with how we price our services for the value that we create, and a lot of the new services that we're developing create higher ROI for our customers that we serve, and so what's key for us is continuing to stay disciplined on our price. We're going to get net price increase in 2016. That, combined with the productivity that we're driving across our entire service network gives us confidence that, that segment will strongly support the margin expansion that we're forecasting for the year, which is roughly 50 to 80 basis points.
Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC
Great. And then just one more if I could, actually. Your commentary on U.S. non-res sounded pretty constructive. As I'm sure you're aware, there have some uneven data points the last several months and just here in the last couple of days, a couple of retailers hitting the wall and things like that. How do you feel about those markets as you look into 2016? Do you, in fact, thinks there's visibility and, I don't know if you have front log or kind of any early color on how orders are shaping up as you look into 2016?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
With the exception of the heavy industrial high hazard end markets, particularly in Western Canada, we're seeing broad-based continued expansion at a similar rate than we've seen during 2015. And I just got back from our sales meeting in North America, and I think we're seeing the activity across the board continuing. We're building a strong pipeline. We're executing with the increased investments we're making. We're executing well in that pipeline.
As Arun mentioned, we do have a tough compare, another tough compare with some large projects that were completed last year, first quarter. But based on what I'm seeing, the way that we're developing the pipeline, the way we're investing in our sales force and then being able to bring new solution to that sales force gives me confidence that we're going to see continued expansion here with the orders that we've been delivering and then, ultimately, with the revenue that comes through over the next year or two.

Our next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys, good morning.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning
Antonella Franzen - Head-Investor Relations
Good morning, Steve.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Steve.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Could you just let me know how the â let us know how the kind of that productivity sales and marketing and R&D kind of finished 2015? Where you came in on those numbers?
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
The $190 million to $210 million and $70 million to $90 million, to compare that to what you guys did in 2015?
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, if you look at the 2015 numbers, Steve, we came at around $80 million in terms of the savings that we got for the year.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And the sales and marketing, and R&D, which I think you said was going to be around $70 million to $90 million this year, what was that in 2015?
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, $70 million to $90 million is the total spend that we expect to have incrementally in 2016 over 2015. And in 2015, our total incremental spend was in the $40 million to $50 million range.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
So I guess I'm just â and I promise I'll come in within the range, but I guess how necessary are some of these investments? It seems like a pretty significant step-up. And I guess the question is, is that in response to a more competitive environment? Are you having to spend more to get what seems like a still relatively low organic growth rate, or is this like we're going to step on the neck of our competition and really accelerate this thing moving forward? I'm just wondering how you can toggle that over the course of the year. It would seem to me that with this year, you had weaker revenues, you were still able to deliver on the margin and you didn't spend anywhere year over year near as much as you're spending this year. So I guess does that question make sense? Maybe it doesn't.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So let me take that, Steve. So if you look at what we've done the first three years, we've been very disciplined around creating the operating company and streamlining all of our processes, which has enabled us to be able to deliver very strong fundamentals, which is what has been driving the returns. As we went through a difficult 2015, we also recognized that we needed to free up additional resources to then put to work on the growth side of the company. And so as we accelerated the restructuring and repositioning, we were planning on now taking those strong fundamentals that we've delivered in the first three years and now leveraging those to a greater degree on the top line.
Now let me give you an example. In retail, we've been working on retail and investing on the front end of our business while we've been accelerating the investments in technology and new solutions within our store performance solutions. And with that effort in 2015, we saw a nice mid-single-digit improvement in our retail orders, and that's playing through now. We've taken that same approach now across the enterprise. And with the incremental roughly $30 million â $35 million that we put to work in 2016, that gives us complete confidence that with the same discipline that we went about driving operational improvement, we're putting to work on the commercial side of our business and believe that with that, we'll be positioned very well to be able to create order growth, which will translate to accelerated revenue growth over the next couple of years.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, so just a quick follow-up on that. I don't think that this high level of spend was necessarily in the model that you provided, the forward three-year model that you provided last fall, I don't think. So is this stepped up level of investment, is this a step up in 2016 and then it goes back to normal in the next three years? And was this something, a decision you made middle of this year? It just seems like it's a pretty significant step-up. And again, is this something â I guess you're talking about is more of an offensive step-up than a defensive one?
Antonella Franzen - Head-Investor Relations
Correct, Steve. It's Antonella. And exactly to your point, when we initially laid out the three-year plan, our net savings over these next three years were expected to be more in the range of $30 million to $40 million a year. And as you know, we did step up our restructuring and repositioning, particularly at the tail end of fiscal 2015, to drive additional savings into 2016 that's going to fund these investments. It is at a higher rate.
One of the other things that I would mention that's driving that increased investment, as George talked about, our E3, which is the implementation of our salesforce.com platform across Tyco to have a global view of the customer. That is clearly something new that we haven't historically done in the past. So that's part of the increase as well as the increase that we started last year with our sales force that we see coming through in this part of the year as well. So it is a bit of an elevated increase. It is more proactive. It's not, per se, defensive at all. And we feel that we can very much fund that with the increased savings we have and still deliver the increased $50 million to $60 million of savings.
Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. We're still getting less earnings for more restructuring, and so I just feel like it's a relatively elevated level of spend, but we'll leave it at that. All right, thanks a lot.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Steve.

Our next question comes from Scott Davis, Barclays. Your line is open.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.

Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Scott.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And, Arun, it has been a pleasure, and good luck to you in the future.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I just didn't want to pile on Steve's question, but I somewhat agree with his conclusions in a way. But give us a sense of what you think normal restructuring is. It's hard I guess over time to think in terms of â there's got to be stuff you can do every year that you call restructuring. At some point, that just is real operating expenses. What do you think is normal if we get past 2016 and we can start to think about 2017, 2018, 2019?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Scott, in a normal environment when you look at our business models with the labor and content that we have, it takes about $75 million a year to get normal productivity, to be able to support the reinvestment, and continue to drive the margin expansion, and that would be on a normalized level. As we look at the current environment being somewhat more challenged, I believe going forward we're going to be positioned to continue the work that we've done from an operational standpoint that has been able to support the reinvestments. It's going to give us confidence that from a top line standpoint we're going to be in a positioned to accelerate.
We've made great progress within our commercial excellence initiatives. And the most recent change with the step-up of the reinvestment is taking the confidence that we achieved during 2015 in the retail vertical and accelerating that across the portfolio. And I can tell you, based on the E3 initiative, getting additional productivity longer term through our sales force, and then with the continued investment in expanding our footprint and our total capability, and then that supported with the new products and new services, especially some of the enterprise software that we're launching, gives me a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to accelerate order growth during 2016, and that will translate into increased revenue growth over the next couple years.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Just conceptually, George, we've had a number of years now of getting Tyco pointed in the right direction and of really getting â there's been a number of different initiatives. Would you be disappointed if, let's say, global GDP â let's just make up a number and say 2.5% next year. Would you be disappointed if you hit 1% core growth as the midpoint of your range? I guess another way to say it, is this guidance â it's based on, obviously, realities and economic headwinds, but at the same time, it's not tremendously cyclical. So I would imagine, given the amount that you've invested in such, that, I mean, is there hope at least that you that think that you can have an above global GDP growth year or above peer group growth year?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would absolutely be disappointed if we came in lower than the GDP. As I said, Scott, the first quarter is going to be our most difficult compare for the company. And when you project what happens after we get through the first quarter, which where we have the â we're going to have the worst compare in oil and gas. We're going to be down 25% in the first quarter of 2016, and we're projecting that vertical to impact the overall company by about â it's going to be about a 10% decline from an oil and gas perspective for the total year.
Now, that being said, when you look at the trends in the other businesses and how it's going to play out during the course of the year, we will be positioned to deliver on that. Even with minus 1% to minus 3% organic growth in the first quarter, we'll be positioned to deliver on that 0% to 2% with the idea that if things are better, then it should be better. But we're being somewhat cautious given what the current environment is.
Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Makes sense. Okay, thank you. I appreciate the color.

Our next question comes from Deane Dray, RBC Capital. Your line is open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And also, best of luck to Arun and welcome to Robert.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning, Deane. Thank you.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, just to start off, give us a sense of how the quarter played out, if you could, organically by month, and then any color on how the first quarter has started off organically.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Deane, as we look at our set of businesses, certainly our Product businesses are more weighted to the latter part of the quarter. And what I would say there is we did have a couple of soft spots, mainly additional softness in the heavy industrial space, similar to what we've seen in oil and gas, as well as, as I said earlier, in our Fire Services with a little bit of a slowdown in the orders that we saw within that segment.
Now, when you look at our I&S businesses, we see continued activity across all of our end markets that we serve in North America. It's mainly driven by the commercial end market as well as some key institutional end markets like higher ed; government seems to be coming back; retail is strong. So in our Fire business, healthcare. So, we're seeing pretty good activity.
And from a service standpoint, we actually had very strong service growth in North America in the fourth quarter. Now, some of that was a recovery. But overall, very strong performance. And then if you go to Rest of World, in line with what we expected with oil and gas and some of the heavy industrial verticals, we've seen now that impact, and that was pretty much in line with what we expected.
So, my assessment would be that the overall environment is similar. It's playing out as we had expected. When I look at order activity so far in the first quarter, it's in line with what we had in the fourth quarter. Certainly, we have a couple of compare issues year-on-year. But I'm confident with the investment that we're making and how we're expanding our capabilities, our footprint and we're enhancing the ability of our front end to be able to get closer to the customer and ultimately execute on the growth, that we're going to see continued positive trends here during the course of 2016.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. And then, it struck me as you were describing the hows and whys regarding the name change in the segments on commenting that you want to be positioned beyond Fire and Security. And that you mentioned retail, we know the presence there. You also have some interesting technologies in hospitals. But what could you share with us on where else you may take your technologies, what other verticals and what might move the needle over the near or medium term?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, so, Deane, when you look at our technology spend, not only are we continuing to invest in our sensors and devices and products and making sure we have leadership product positions, which we have today and we continue to grow, but now also developing software. It will enable us to be able to take, for instance, Tyco on with all of our connected hardware, to be able to maintain the health of systems and being able to maintain systems that are installed. And then on top of that, being able to utilize the data that's extracted from those systems to be able to put to work in new services that enhance the operations of our customers, no matter what vertical that we support.
And so we're today working on â there are a dozen growth projects similar to startups that we're investing in that are going to be new, new business. And these are platforms that are enabled by technology that fundamentally create a much higher ROI for the customers that we serve, leveraging the same infrastructure that we serve them with in Fire and Security.
And so across-the-board, as these ecosystems develop in the connected world, being able to now utilize our software platforms to extract the data, apply analytics and then ultimately create new services that get built on top of the traditional services that we've provided.

Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Brian Gibbons - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. This is Brian Gibbons in for Julian this morning. I was wondering if you could give some color on you margin expansion assumptions for 2016 across the segments. Will it be another tough of year for Rest of the World, or is there some room for turnaround there?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, so the segment that has driven the margin expansion in 2015 certainly was North America. We exceeded our expectations, delivering about 200 basis points. Now that being said, as you project going forward, we're going to get continued productivity but we're putting more of that to work to support the growth.
And so in total for the company, we'll achieve roughly 50 basis points to 80 basis points. That is ultimately going to be offsetting about 10 basis points of purchase price accounting. And then when you look at the segmentation, North America would be roughly, we're estimating somewhere around 20 to 40 basis points. And in Rest of World it's about the same, about 20 basis points to 40 basis points. And then within our Product businesses, we get into more of the growth phase in the latter part of the year, and we deliver â it's roughly about 110 basis points, 160 basis points, and that's including offsetting 30 basis points of purchase price accounting.
Brian Gibbons - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Great, very helpful. And then on your free cash conversion, what do you are the most important levers there to increase cash conversion in 2016?
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Brian, it's across-the-board. And as we look at the free cash conversion getting up to the 90% to 100% for 2016, it's really improving each of the DSOs, the DPOs and the DIOs. So, we're working across all of the fronts there, working capital metrics to get to that number.

Our next question comes from Steve Winoker, Bernstein. Your line is open.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning, all. Arun, I'll echo my congrats and good luck going forward.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Steve.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
So, George, let me just make sure I understand the guidance in 2016 on oil and gas progression. I understand that, really, the major headwind started in third quarter and fourth quarter. But are you simply saying that, look, the guidance is assuming no kind of underlying improvement in oil and gas for the year; we're just saying we're taking advantage of the benefit of easier comps in the second half?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, the way that I look at it, the way it's going to hit us here is we have our worst comp here in the first quarter, right, with oil and gas being down about 25%. And then as that plays out, we see that stabilizing a bit, especially as it relates to our service business. We are seeing continued pressure on CapEx, but that will impact us longer term as far as the new projects that are being booked or lack of new projects. And then â so as we project the overall volume, it's going to stabilize, but still net it's going to be down 10% for the total year.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. And is there any pricing pressure in any of that that you're seeing?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Anytime one of these end markets downturn like they have, there's certainly pricing pressure. And what we do is stay very disciplined, not only in our Product businesses but in the Service business, making sure that we're getting price for the value that we contribute. And so, net of it all, we get price during the course of the year. So we work within that, that environment, to make sure that we're staying price positive, but certainly that does come into effect as it relates to the volume.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think one thing we have seen here is where automatic renewals of our service contracts, et cetera, they're coming off of competitive bids each time now as the renewals come out.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right.
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So we're maintaining our pricing discipline, but clearly there's more competition out there.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay. And you're holding share count flat in your guidance. Is there upside opportunity to that? Are you saying, look, we're spending, really planning on moving all the excess to M&A?
Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Steve, that's the â what we have said is that we still do have a pipeline of M&A activities, that is the best use of capital and that's our projection going forward. But at the same time, we will not sit on cash and if cash accumulates we will accelerate the buybacks.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
Okay, all right. And I guess one last thing. The restructuring, if I sort of look at the year-on-year EPS growth, which is clearly higher than most other peers that I'm looking at, above 20%, but for most of that is really restructuring expense reduction year-on-year. What are the chances, George, that you think that there's â that you could even go higher than that $75 million to $100 million range, or you feel like that's pretty much locked in?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Steve, at this stage, we've taken a cautious outlook on the year. We have obviously, in the second half of 2015, we had accelerated a lot of our cost out restructuring to position for 2016, not only to support the reinvestment but continue to deliver strong EPS growth. And so given our view of the world today, we feel good about the guidance we've provided. Certainly, depending on how the markets play out will affect how we look at restructuring as well as our reinvestment in growth, and we'll balance the two as the year plays out.
Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC

Arun Nayar - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Shannon.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC
On the restructuring, I mean, how do we now think about kind of the three-year targets that you guys laid out? I mean, it was originally off of a normalized base in 2015 of, I think, $2.25 normalized for $75 million of restructuring. It ended up being a lot higher than that. Is the 12% to 15% CAGR still intact? And if it is, is it now up $1.74 or how do we think about that?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
The change from our Investor Day last November in laying out the three-year plan, certainly the economic environment has changed pretty significantly. Now, assuming that type of environment, the $75 million that we spend every year to drive labor productivity, mainly the labor productivity to support the reinvestment and margin expansion, it had to increase given the look that we have today relative to the global macroeconomic environment.
And so, what I would say is that while in a growing global economy we should be positioned to be able to maintain and deliver on those type of goals in a normal environment, with $75 million of restructuring. With the changes that we've seen, then it's prudent to make sure that we are managing the fundamentals in a changed environment so that we can make the investments and be positioned to capitalize on the growth that will occur going forward.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just can you clarify a little bit this ramp for the year for Global Products? A lot of margin improvement there, but it sounds like the first quarter margins are going to be under pressure. So, where do we start with margins there and then what drives the ramps for the year?
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
When you look at last year, we had a strong start of last year. We were plus 10% in the first quarter on a volume basis, and then year-on-year we're saying we're going to be down mid-single digits. And so when you look at the mix â and a lot of this is driving the mix in our Fire Protection Products business which is supporting oil and gas as well as our Life Safety business, so that as you look at it, as it plays out during the year, our total margin rate in the first quarter will be down about 120 basis points in Products, but then as you look out as we play through the year we get back to an average of about 19% to 19.5%. And a lot of that is when you look at the investments we're making with the normalizing the volume that we'll achieve in the second, third and fourth quarter, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to deliver on those margin rates.
Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. That helps.
Antonella Franzen - Head-Investor Relations
I'd like to pass the call back over to George for some closing comments.
George R. Oliver - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So in summary, our fiscal 2015 year results demonstrate that question know how to execute in a tough economic environment. We're going to remain focused on making the right investments, whether that be in R&D or sales and marketing, and driving our ongoing restructuring and productivity initiatives and deploying our capital to create shareholder value.
