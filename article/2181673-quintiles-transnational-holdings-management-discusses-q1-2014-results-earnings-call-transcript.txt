On behalf of Quintiles, hello and welcome to today's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Brian, and I will be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan
Thank you, Brian. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles' First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Karl. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Let's begin on Slide 3 with a few highlights. As we approach the first anniversary next week of our reentry into the public markets, I'm proud of our accomplishments over the last year. After a strong 2013 performance, I'm pleased to report that we're off to a great start in 2014. We delivered strong financial results in the first quarter and continue to grow our backlog, positioning us nicely for the longer term.
For the second sequential quarter, we delivered over $1 billion of services revenues, representing 8.4% constant-currency growth. With the new -- with the strong new business bookings from the recent quarters, our Integrated Healthcare Services segment returned to growth and contributed 7.9% service revenue growth at constant currency exchange rates.
We expanded our adjusted income from operations margin by 140 basis points. We also grew our adjusted net income by 58% and our adjusted EPS by 39%, nice growth rates across the board. We're continuing to see strong demand for our services and solutions across both of our segments and across large pharma, mid-sized pharma and biotech and emerging pharma. We eclipsed the $10 billion mark in backlog for the first time as a company.
We recorded over $1.27 billion of net new business during the quarter, which represents a consolidated book to bill of 1.27x services revenues. In Product Development, we booked $1.01 billion new business, representing a book to bill of 1.3x in the quarter. In this segment, we continue to see strong strength in the Phase II to Phase IV pipeline and more opportunities in the Phase I early clinical development area.
Our Integrated Healthcare Services segment booked $269 million of net new business, representing a book to bill of 1.15, which is above our historical annual average and above the normally lower first quarter ratios. We have now had 3 consecutive quarters of strong bookings in this segment and are off to a promising start in 2014, all of which contributes meaningfully to the increase in our revenue growth outlook for the year. We also continue to see significant demand for observational real-world and late-phase research services.
Last week, we issued a joint press release with Biogen Idec formally announcing our clinical development partnership. This is the partnership that we disclosed on a no-name basis on our third quarter earnings call in 2013. Partnerships like this utilize our broad range of product development services capabilities from planning and design through clinical execution through observational research. Our scale and firewall practices allow us to provide these full-service relationships with a number of customers. Frankly, the goal is simple: to increase the customers' probability of success. Partnering improves results, and there's no reason for costly redundant infrastructures.
As noted in our third quarter earnings call, we only record wins from these type of strategic relationships when supported by written confirmation of the specific trial, and therefore, typically, these types of relationships will result in additional net new business in future quarters rather than a onetime increase.
Now before I hand it over to Kevin, let me briefly address the recent publicity regarding potential M&A transactions within the pharmaceutical industry and the potential impact to Quintiles. As we've discussed previously, from time to time, there'll be transactions among the pharmaceutical firms. Diversity is our strength, as we've continued to maintain a highly diversified customer portfolio with over 500 biopharmaceutical customers, the broadest therapeutic coverage and no customer representing 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Many of these combinations are looking to preserve quality pipelines and lower costs. And that's what we're about: development and commercial productivity. We believe the increasing trend toward outsourcing will continue to provide long-term growth opportunities for Quintiles, and we're best positioned to capitalize on these trends.
Now let me hand over to Kevin, who will provide some greater detail on the financial results.
Kevin K. Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. Let's begin with the consolidated results. For the quarter ended March 31, 2014, our consolidated service revenues grew 8.4% compared to the prior year, both at constant currency and actual foreign exchange rates. We finished the quarter with over $1 billion of service revenues compared to $927.4 million in the comparable prior-year quarter.
The global diversification of our service revenues remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year, with a slight uptick in the North America and Latin America region up to 41%; Europe, Middle East, and Africa at 39%; and the Asia-Pacific region moved down slightly to 20% of the total consolidated revenues.
For the first quarter, adjusted SG&A of $219.2 million was 21.8% of service revenues compared to $198 million or 21.4% of service revenues in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs from the Novella business combination, an increase in share-based compensation and an increase in marketing-related expenses. Compared with the prior year first quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 20.2% to $142.3 million, a margin of 14.2%. Margins increased 140 basis points, comprised of 30 basis points from operations and productivity improvements and 110 basis points from the positive foreign exchange impacts.
We had 2 non-operating items contribute $0.04 per share to adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter. First, other income, net, was $4.8 million during the quarter, composed primarily of a $5 million gain from the sale of marketable securities. Second, our investment in the NovaQuest Pharma Opportunities Fund is accounted for under the equity method, and therefore, we record our portion of the funds earnings or losses in each respective period. In the first quarter of 2014, we recorded a $4.7 million unrealized gain compared to a $2.8 million loss in the first quarter of 2013.
We recognized $1 million of net restructuring charges during the first quarter in connection with the previously announced and approved restructuring plans. We expect to incur additional costs under these plans through their completion in 2014. The GAAP effective income tax rate was 30.5% during the quarter compared to 39.2% for the same period last year. The current quarter effective income tax rate was positively impacted by our change in income tax accounting resulting from a change in assertion in 2013 to permanently reinvest our earnings in most foreign jurisdictions.
Adjusted net income grew 57.8% to $90.9 million in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Contributing to the adjusted net income growth were the increased service revenues, improved operating margins, reduced interest expense due to both lower interest rates and debt levels, the gain from the sale of marketable securities, the equity in earnings from NovaQuest, and the reduction in the effective income tax rate.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 38.8% to $0.68 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.49 per share in the same period in the prior year. Our cash balance was $741 million as of the end of the quarter, of which $290 million was in the U.S.
Cash used in operations was $28.4 million in the current year quarter compared to $21.5 million used for the same period in 2013. The increase in cash used during the quarter was due to an increase of 5 DSO days compared to 2013 year end, higher payments for income taxes and higher payments for incentive compensation. The current year 5-day increase in DSOs compared to a 3-day increase in the first quarter of 2013. Year-end DSO days are typically lower. These uses of cash were partially offset by the increase in net income and the lower interest payments of $9 million compared to the same period in 2013.
Capital expenditures were $17.7 million in the first 3 months of this year compared to $31.5 million during the same period in 2013. The lower capital expenditures were timing related and we believe will increase to normal levels as a percentage of revenues through the year.
Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at March 31, 2014, was $1.3 billion compared to $1.27 billion at the end of 2013. We did not repurchase any shares of common stock under the authorized repurchase program during the first quarter. $59.5 million remains available under the equity repurchase program.
Now let's turn to Slide 5 and take a look at our 2 reporting segments. Product Development segment accounted for 77% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 23% for the quarter, a 1% greater percentage from Product Development compared with the same period in 2013.
Product Development's revenue grew 9.1% to $770.8 million in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. At constant currency exchange rates, Product Development service revenues grew 8.6%. Novella, which we acquired during the third quarter of 2013, contributed $32.7 million to revenues in the quarter. First quarter service revenue growth resulted from an increase in North America core clinical services, growth in clinical trial support services, volume increases in our global lab business and contribution from Novella, which was partially offset by the impact of the wind-down of a large clinical project that we delivered throughout 2013.
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $160.6 million, representing 21.1% growth at actual rates. Product Development income from operations margin was 20.8% in the quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to the same period last year, with 130 basis points from foreign exchange benefits, core operations and increased productivity partially offset by an increase at SG&A, principally in connection with the Novella acquisition, contributed 70 basis points of improvement.
IHS service revenues increased by 6% or $13.4 million to $234.5 million in the first quarter. At constant foreign exchange rates, service revenues increased 7.9% compared to the same period last year. Service revenues for the quarter in IHS segment were positively impacted by an increase in North America from bookings in 2013, as well as a continuation of very strong growth in our observational real-world and late-phase research unit, offset by a $4.2 million foreign exchange headwind.
IHS income from operations for the quarter was $9 million, an increase of 43.2% at actual foreign exchange rates and 56.3% at constant currency compared to the same period in 2013. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 4.1% at constant currency rates and 3.8% at actual foreign exchange rates.
In summary, our 2014 first quarter results continued the consistent performance in Product Development, with good service revenue growth offset by the impact from the completion of our largest clinical project, increased margins from our continued focus on operational productivity and over $1 billion of net new business. We believe the strong new business from the second half of 2013 in our IHS segment is being realized and the strong new business wins continued in the first quarter, contributing to the segment's return to growth.
Now turning to Slide 6 and our 2014 guidance update. Carrying forward the strength from the first quarter and with the outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We are now targeting service revenues between $4.13 billion and $4.19 billion, representing constant currency growth of 8.4% to 10%. We believe the majority of the revenue increase over our previous guidance should be from the IHS segment given the stronger bookings coming through the first quarter and the near-term business expectations in this segment -- new business expectations in this segment.
We are raising our diluted adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $2.45 and $2.58 per share, representing growth of 16.7% to 22.9%, with diluted GAAP earnings per share between $2.38 and $2.52 per share. We continue to believe that our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 30%.
It is important to note that these estimates assume the end of March 2014 foreign currency exchange rates and do not reflect the impact of any potential repurchases pursuant to our equity repurchase program.
And I'll now turn the call back over to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike
Thanks, Kevin. The strength of our bookings over the past 6 quarters is being realized, as you can see from the updated guidance. Our guidance is based on organic growth, however, we continue to look at accretive capability-enhancing acquisitions, which form an important part of our overall growth strategy.
Turning to Slide 7. As we've indicated, IHS is back on the growth side of the ledger, and Product Development continues to execute consistently on all fronts: net new business, revenue growth, operational delivery and margin expansion. In both segments, we continue to see strong demand for our services across large, mid-sized and small biopharma. We're also optimistic on the continued strength of biotech and NME approvals, with 8 being approved in the first quarter of 2014.
We continue to focus on quality and patients enrolled in our clinical studies and are very pleased to be recognized as a leader in many ways, including having won a number of awards during the quarter, for example, Best CRO in Asia for the third consecutive year from the BioPharma Asia Industry Awards; recognized as the industry leader in Phase II/Phase III clinical research for the second year in a row by ISR, which is the Industry Standard Research organization; several Great Place to Work Awards, such as in Italy, Germany, Poland and Canada. These are all very powerful examples of how we're differentiated in the marketplace and the strength of our global network of 29,000-plus employees.
I'd also like to briefly comment on the power of our global business operating model. This quarter's margin improvement highlighted this model. We have a business model that allows a great amount of business to be delivered through lower-cost countries. We are the leaders in risk-based monitoring, which we call data-driven trial execution, where we monitor in lower-cost locations to reduce the cost while improving the quality of the trial. We're also migrating more of our activities to lower-cost hubs around the world as our business grows.
We continue to focus on executing our strategic agenda, which I initially framed for you during our second quarter 2013 call, and is perhaps more important in the current environment and in this year. Our strategic agenda includes the following: first, investing in offerings and assets that leverage our scale and very importantly, create value for our customers. We are focused on that customer value. Second, leading with world-class customer relationship management. Not only do we have people at our larger accounts and our mid-sized accounts on a dedicated basis, but we're in the executive suites of our customers. Third, driving quality, productivity and proactive delivery management. Our goal is to exceed the quality expectations of our customers and increase the productivity of the industry. And of course, to do all these things, we're investing in our people for leadership development and high-performance workforce. I truly believe these strategic pillars, which what I drive every day, benefit our customers, which creates value for our shareholders and employees.
Before we finish, let me say a few more words regarding the pharmaceutical industry environment. In any time of uncertainty, one thing is for sure: you want to go into that situation with the best team and the best business model. While our industry suffered a disruption 6 years ago, we powered through with revenue and EBITDA growth in each year from 2008 to 2012. We grew from $2.7 billion to $3.7 billion in services revenue during the same period and are the largest and most diverse by a good measure.
We have the industry's largest backlog at over $10 billion and consistent book-to-bill ratios since 2008. We're aligned with our customers' goals of value creation and productivity. We shouldn't forget that the science has never been better, and there are huge unmet medical needs that will fuel innovation in this industry. I'm confident in our ability to succeed even in the sometimes changing landscape of this industry. We believe we will stay the leader with our great team and business model.
In closing, I'd like to recognize and thank the entire Quintiles team for their dedication to improving health care. We're pleased with our first quarter achievements and financial results and believe we're well positioned to execute against our strategic priorities this year and beyond.
Now let me turn back to Karl for some question and answer.
Karl Deonanan
Thanks, Tom. We are ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Question, yes, so the net wins in both segments really trended well in the quarter and were certainly better than what we were looking for. Any sense you can give us within both segments on what drove the new business growth? I guess, specifically, IHS, obviously, nice turnaround, maybe anything incremental there worth calling out? And then on Product Development, if you could maybe just help us think about the split between new wins relative to strategic deals versus wins outside of your strategic base?
Thomas H. Pike
Sure. Let me touch on Product Development first. We have seen our pipeline continue to be strong, and it is roughly a little bit above the average of last year. And you may recall, Bob, from the prior calls that our pipeline has been at record levels over the last 4 or 5 quarters in general. So Product Development continued strong. Interestingly, there was less about strategic deals in this quarter than there was just great customer relationships and then the normal flow of RFPs. And so it wasn't about -- it was interesting because we announced the Biogen, however, that was prior. And this was really about great customer relationships. With regard to IHS, I think what you can see is some continued return to this interest in variability associated with the sales force as we get into the product launches. And this is creating an attractive situation for us in terms of proposals, not only for core sales force but for a diversity of market-access work and other types of work. And then the other real pillar of that segment, as Kevin mentioned in his remarks, is the real world, late phase, is we're having a terrific year both in terms of new business and revenue growth. We were the leaders in that segment. We've just announced a new version of our good research and comparative effectiveness principles, and that segment, clearly, is benefited by the real world, late phase. Does that help, Bob?
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
No, that's very helpful.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So Tom, you kind of like addressed, I think, the area that investors, analysts focused on along what we're hearing on pharma consolidation. So thank you for the comments. Can you maybe provide us a little bit more detail on kind of like Quintiles' exposure to the companies that are in play? And I think the context on -- the historical context on the impact to Quintiles from kind of a Class I [ph] pharma consolidation was very helpful. But can you also elaborate on what might be different in the industry today than it was in the past? I think back then, there was also the issue of biotech funding that was coming under pressure. So just tell us like how you think about industry dynamics today versus back then.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I think that's a great question, and maybe I'll touch on 2 things in there, Ricky. One, you're right. Biotech funding does continue to seem to be a strength, and while we didn't comment on it specifically, the numbers that we have are that, in this quarter, there was another real record over the last number of quarters in terms of biotech funding. And so that continues to be an underlying strength. You might recall, about 51% of our net new business last year was outside of the top pharmaceutical firms. So it provides a little bit different underpinning than we had when people were running away from investments. The other thing that I can't emphasize enough is our diversity. With 10 customers at over $100 million of revenues, and then as we looked at it just in advance of the call, we looked at our net new business, interestingly, the new business top customers don't overlap entirely with the top 10 customers. You see somewhat of a continuous flow, and that, I think, provides the strength of diversity. And Ricky, the one thing that I'd add, I'm not sure if casual listeners understand, but the question is probably more about net new business than it is about canceling trials because pharma companies incur some consequences for terminating ongoing studies for nonscientific reasons. Now they can jeopardize investigator relationships, key opinion leader relationships. They can actually breach ethical norms to conclude studies once they've started. And then many times, the assets have some kind of value, so you don't want to stop midstream when they could be sold or in some way brought into the portfolio. So I think a lot of investors probably don't understand our industry at a level to know that when you look at that $10 billion backlog and you're in a large Phase III trial, there are a lot of considerations before any cancellations take place, well beyond the commercial. So does that help?
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.
Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
So you had specifically made the comment in these times of volatility, among large pharma, that you've got to get in there and kind of show your face and obviously try to be a shoulder to lean on. As we think about the companies that are kind of in the public realm in terms of in play, obviously, big pharma tends to move in a herd-like fashion. So let's say a deal does go down, there's probably going to be another one. You do have the most diversified revenue stream in Phase III, and I'm just wondering, does that give you kind of a springboard in terms of being able to get in there and potentially become one of the core partners for some of these combined pharma assets post kind of the dust settling?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I have to say, Greg, I think it does. And Kevin and I just talked about this the other day, that the obligation that I have and our senior management has is when there are 2 companies considering these types of things, we often understand that development portfolio extremely well. And our obligation is to help our customers create value. What may not be not known about us is we have skills in terms of portfolios and evaluating the quality of the portfolio and our consulting organization and clinical design organization. And we also have the execution skills and the commercialization skills that really no one else in the industry has. So since we'll know the portfolios, we can be extremely helpful in terms of everything from rationalization to productivity enhancement to transitioning as people are thinking about new locations or shutdowns of these types of things. The thing that strikes me about the industry is that we are transitioning where I just don't see why we need 6 sets of railroad tracks into the same locations around the world. I don't know why we have to be next to customer 1, customer 2, customer 3 in Argentina and why we can't just have 1 or 2 sets of railroad tracks in there and let us do the heavy lifting for them in the 100 countries around the world where we need to work. So I think the top executives get it, and the obligation for us in this company, in particular, is to help them create more value.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Tom, could you perhaps elaborate a little bit more on how your business is segmented out between large pharma, mid and small? Maybe if you could contrast what you're seeing in current revenues versus perhaps what you're seeing in new business? And would that suggest any kind of shifting mix over the next few quarters?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, we don't break it out in too much detail, to be honest with you. We've given a few statistics out like the 1, I think, I mentioned to Ricky a few minutes ago about 51% of the new business being outside of large pharma. We have worked with all top 20 biopharma in the last 11 years, have the same 8 customers over $100 million of revenue for the past 6 years. So what's interesting is you do -- every year, you do see a little bit of flow from, in particular, new mid-sized biopharma that's very successful, rising up through the ranks. And then I -- we have definitely seen an increase in our pipeline associated with the funding for biotech. There's no question about it that when they get their funding, much of it is coming toward clinical development as they try to prove their compounds out. So for this period of time, while we're getting that funding, we're seeing more. And what we've decided to do is we've really concentrated our effort on trying to bring the -- an offering where you can get the best of Quintiles, being the global scale capabilities, the consulting capabilities, the ability to design your clinical trial, the regulatory support, to get the best of Quintiles even if you're a small customer. And our management team is -- essentially, we designed the members of the management team to help the executives in small biopharma with their situations to just try to make sure that they get adequate coverage. So essentially, what's happened is we've continued to broaden our diversity as the market has changed here. So again, we don't give out details of that, but I hope that gives you a sense of some of our strategic initiatives to try to take advantage of the current environment.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Want to hone in on margins. Nice progress there, on -- in particular on Product Development. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that was a function of mix versus price? Or are there other factors impacting the margins there?
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. Tycho, the primary driver of that margin improvement continues to be our efforts around productivity improvement, resource management and positioning of where we're doing the work. I think you heard Tom talk about our ability to offer from low-cost countries, do risk-based monitoring and a number of other things. So as we look at Product Development, in particular, we're really focused on how do we continue to drive productivity from that sense. I would say, if you look at it from a price perspective, it'd be relatively little contribution. We've talked often about the competitive nature of the segment or the sector, but very much driven by what our operations folks are doing in positioning the business and how we deliver.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
A bit of a longer-term question here. It looked -- Product Development constant-currency organic growth last year was 6%. If I'd look at your guidance this year, it looks like it's going to be 6%, and that's a little bit below kind of the longer-term targets that you've set for yourself. Do you still think that -- kind of that high-single-digit territory is what we should be thinking about in the longer term for the Product Development segment on a constant-currency organic basis?
Kevin K. Gordon
Tim, it's a good question. I think with the -- it's important to point out though, as you look at this year's growth rate, we talked about the strength of the backlog and what we put into backlog. But we also referred to, on our year-end call, about a trial that's winding down or has now wound down that was going to have about a 390-basis-point impact on this year's revenues. So as you start thinking about that 6% that you're quoting and you start adding that back on, you'll see the, I think, the Product Development growth rate continues to be in that -- or will in that upper single and potentially even beyond with the strength of the bookings that we just not only recorded through the last several quarters, but even here with over $1 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
So I wanted to maybe just go back to the M&A discussion just for a minute. In terms of understanding the sort of impact on a more near-term basis, if you look back historically, is it normally like a 1- to 2-quarter effect on kind of new bookings if there is any sort of disruption at all and then we kind of renormalize and then theoretically, in a case of it's acquired, that is a greater outsourcer than target, maybe even we end up net-net better off in terms of new business and market or you can act as a agent to help them execute on synergies? I'm just trying get the -- more the timing aspect of it versus kind of the risk.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, and I'll start with the second part of your question there, Ross. When we look at these, we do look at them in an interesting way that most of these become opportunities in some way. And most of this results -- because there's a changed management, the opportunity to really examine whether they should be outsourcing more those is a key management issue. And so I think you may have heard on some of the other calls, too, that, in general, we expect more outsourcing after this kind of disruption than before because you get management looking at their cost structures and looking at how they deliver and wondering why they look at redundant infrastructures and wonder why they're, frankly, in -- when you can focus on the science and focus on the commercialization, why are you in this part of the business to the degree you are. And so I'll tell you, it's very difficult the near term versus long term. I think you're right. If there is something, it'll be around new business potentially freezing a little bit in some of these. But you even look at the rumors beyond Pfizer, AZ, and you -- people are talking about AbbVie. They're talking about Amgen. They're talking -- you just look at the rumors, and it's just very difficult to have a clear view of whether this is a few months or a couple of quarters. The thing that I would go back to is that we did power through the 2008-2012 with consistent book to bills, and we think if you look at the backlog, as you implied, the backlog is not -- it's not at risk in the way that people might think at face value with the consolidation. And so it's just very important to help our investors, all of us, to help our investors understand what the real implications are to these things. It could be growth, could be a little flatness in new business, probably limited effects on revenue, at least for somebody as diversified as we are.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Rafael Tejada - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
It's actually Rafael in for Derick. So my question is very similar to Ross' and one of the questions we get from investors is just the way in which the business performed just prior to the difficulty, the down cycle in let's say, 2008 to 2011 and that -- it's very clear to us that Quintiles was able to power through that down cycle. But how does that compare to the prior few years in terms of the performance that the company had there, especially just given some of the changes in the continuing operations? So any color you can give us in terms of sales growth and margin expansion during -- margin changes during that period would be really helpful.
Thomas H. Pike
Maybe let me start on the one -- the growth piece. It's an interesting backdrop to think that there are 4,400 medications in clinical trials right now, various compounds, different types in clinical trials. So we're at record levels. If you talk to the leaders of the pharmaceutical companies, I know a lot of you guys do, like I do, the science has just never been better in terms of discovery and targeting. So the expectations are actually better about the quality of the clinical trials. They'll either stop sooner or they'll be more likely to be successful. So the backdrop that we have is one where it's an attractive environment for innovative drug development in general, and in general, our customers are being valued for those pipelines. So you've got that macro environment, and then you've got companies that are trying -- really good executives, I think, running our pharmaceutical companies now who are trying to maximize value within that. And part of maximizing that value is having as effective development costs as possible. So I think you have to look at it not only on the micro of the mergers and acquisitions but take it to the macro of what's happening in the industry. Now margins, it's really in the backlog, and so in general, could there be some changes? Yes, but in general, this stuff is in the backlog. It's sold. It's contracted. And so I think, generally, what's going to happen here is, once again, the larger the companies get, the larger the CROs need to be to service them. I don't know, Kevin, if you have anything to add regarding specifics.
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes, and I think your specific question was how did we fare during that period of time, where perhaps there was some disruption. And then just to give you a sense of that, to answer to your question maybe specifically as to how did Quintiles perform, from 2008 through 2012, we grew our overall revenues over 7% on a compound annual basis. We grew our EBITDA on a compound basis of nearly 14% during that 5-year window from 2008 to 2012. And our net new business grew pretty significantly, over 6%, and we had book to bills that were averaging over 1.2x. So I think it goes back to what Tom even said in his remarks as to how we're positioned as a company, the diversity of our customer base, our ability to provide the service offering on a global basis that I think allowed us to power through that time as well. So from a dynamic standpoint, I think our margins held up well, and actually, in the latter part of that, you saw our margins start -- continue to improve, which we're seeing today. So as you think about it and how we're positioned and the financial metrics of the company and the size, as Tom just alluded to, I think we feel, as Tom said in his remarks, pretty good about our ability with some of the speculative things that may be occurring out there.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bailin with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Jeffrey Bailin - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Maybe to shift gears for a moment, Tom. On the recent formal Biogen announcement and the Merck Serono announcement last year, could you maybe talk about the appetite for some of these more involved strategic partnerships that you're seeing amongst both your current customer base and maybe amongst other large players? And then maybe, Kevin, just on the margin profile, as you saw on some of the higher-value services and more involved, if that's a little different than the typical type of relationship?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I -- we do still see interest, Jeff. And it's regular conversations with customers and with our teams and trying to help, especially mid-sized pharma. What mid-sized pharma can do -- it's funny because mid-sized pharma has tens of billions of dollars in market cap these days, so the world is evolving. But they get the capabilities to go across many more therapeutic areas and frankly, have much more global coverage than they might have otherwise if we help them with the model. And we do have the firewall set up to be able to deal with multiple of these situations simultaneously. We have enough executives and enough people here to be able to dedicate, and we have a very strong compliance organization that reinforces the privacy where required. And so we are in more discussions about it. I do think the largest guys will have the tendency to develop their own strategies, and we're in discussions with some of them about development models, too. But they're more likely to have a formed strategy, and our general goal with the largest customers is to be competitive where things are competitive and to get extra value where we add more value. And our general goal is to not just be an agency business or a service provider in that sense, but to be a value-added partner in terms of what we do so that we are working together. So with one large customer this quarter, we're doing something that's going to significantly increase their productivity with them. And we can't -- we generally don't announce customer relationships, but we're working to significantly increase their productivity. And that's what we're all about. I don't know, Kevin, if you want to comment on the margins.
Kevin K. Gordon
I think you covered it. As you look at some of these structures that you just referred to, I think we've indicated this on previous calls, is generally, you're working well with the customer terms of how you price the opportunity with a customer, but it's about the value and the efficiency that you bring that provides, perhaps, maybe a bit lower price but can drive margins in a similar way because of the efficiencies that you gain across the model, and whether that's a programmatic-type approach of following a molecule all the way across the development cycle or other costs that might exist. So ultimately, we look for very similar margin opportunities but creating more value for our customer.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I wanted to go outside, kind of completely outside of the core business here. I think around the time of the IPO, there was some discussion around using the significant stores of data that you are collecting through your clinical trial activity to provide data products or analytical services, things like that, to nontraditional clients. And I wondered if that was still a focus and what progress you've made on that front.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes. It's a great question. It's funny, on these calls, Dave, we do have a tendency to focus on the larger revenue and profit pools because that's just the nature of the beast. But we really pride ourselves on trying to continue to bring innovation. And so we are continuing on that journey in a number of ways. We are pretty renowned for our technology in this industry, you may know, and we do partner with people like Medi and Oracle. But fill in a lot of gaps with that technology that are really around how do you analyze the data, how do you run the trial better, how do you remote monitor those trials, how do you run a portfolio of trials and how do you do the design in a -- what the systems folks would call a jab session, sort of a joint design session, a clinical trial. So we have some pieces of technology that nobody else has that we're very proud of. And to be honest, I'm trying to -- I'm working with our Chief Technology Officer, Richard Thomas, to figure out how to create the most value for the company out of furthering that technology and then actually helping install it in customers, as well as within our own use for our own services. And then the other area, with 600 biostatisticians in this company and books showing up on my desk -- the most recent 1 is from 1 of our wonderful statisticians, Michael O'Kelly, it's about finding missing -- how do you deal with missing data in trials -- showing up on my desk regularly. The question is how do we bring that analytical expertise into issues like data transparency or into providers. We continue to meet with providers and technology companies who are in the IT area for providers to try to figure out how we can bring that analytical expertise. So this remains an area of interest for me. I think I'd like to say -- and we always sit in the room with our General Counsel on these things. So this is a somewhat forward-looking statement. I'd like to say that over the next few years, you'll see us in -- broader than biopharmaceutical in a material way, because we've brought these deep analytical skills and understanding of technology out into some other realms of healthcare. And so it is something that we focus on for innovation. We don't talk about it because it's not material from a financial standpoint, but clearly, I think with the skills that we have here with the 950 docs, the 900 PhDs, the 600 biostatisticians, I think we have a capability to do more than we're doing today.

The next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.
Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Yes. So just wanted to kind of follow up there on the information technology theme. This is kind of interesting with you all. So when you win these -- when I think about clinical trials and the use of information technology, when you're winning these strategic relationships and I guess, you're involved at a very high level in decision-making, are you sort of selecting technologies? Well, I know you partner with some other vendors, but are you really driving decisions around the use of technology?
Thomas H. Pike
I think we're influencing more than -- we're not it's always up to the customer to make the ultimate decision, and I think Medi and Oracle and others can be very good partners for these guys. But we are influencing at times, and we're -- we do believe that one of the greatest elements of productivity for the industry is having more data that we manage trials with so that you can understand what's happening in your trial on an earlier basis, so that you can have the logistics, be better managed associated with the trials, so you can make sure you're focused on investigators where there are challenges, whether they'd be patient recruiting or that investigator themselves maybe tardy on certain things. So it just lets you focus in a way that if you looked at other industries, you would have seen automation to the degree we're doing today probably 10 or 15 years ago. We're now at a point where we can use technology automation and data to really modernize what's going on. And I think Quintiles has to be a leader in this. We have a first-mover advantage. We really started looking at this at about 2005, and now it's really coming to fruition. That is part of the strategic partnerships. Very common for our technology and how it integrates with these other guys to be part of that deal. How does it use? How do we manage with it? Where is it going? How can we change our practices using the technology? So that is very much a discussion point, I would say the big deal last Friday, and this discussion point probably was 1/4. How does technology play in? Probably 1/4 of a several-hour meeting.
