Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the IHS Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Boyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Eric Boyer
Good morning and thank you for joining us for the IHS second quarter earnings conference call. We issued our second quarter earnings release earlier this morning. If you do not have a copy of this release, it is available on our website at ihs.com.
Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items. Our earnings release includes both, our GAAP-based income statement and statement of cash flows and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules are included in our release and can also be found on our website.
The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS is prohibited.
Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from the expectations can be found in IHS' filings with the SEC and on the IHS website.
After our prepared remarks, Jerre Stead, IHSâ Chairman and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.
With that it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead. Jerre?
Jerre Stead
Thank you, Eric. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we share our second quarter results. Itâs a pleasure to be speaking with you once again and to be leading IHS. I'm excited to be back in the CEO role, interacting with our colleagues, our customers, and our shareholders on a daily basis.
Itâs been a quick three weeks since I took this role, but I would like to share with you my initial impression of where we stand, our opportunities for improvement, and the near-term initiatives on what the company will be focused. We will also talk about the evolution of our capital allocation strategy, including M&A, share buyback, and our employee stock based compensation expense. Then Todd will cover in detail our results for the quarter, provide more context around our stock buyback, and will update guidance for the RootMetrics acquisition.
For Q2, revenue performance was largely in line with our expectations. We delivered solid adjusted EBITDA, margin, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Few highlights in the period include revenues of $591 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2014 and up 1% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3%, representing an expansion of 90 basis points year-over-year and benefited from operating model efficiencies and ongoing realization of synergies. And we continued to deliver strong free cash flow.
In terms of our core industries and horizontal workflows , resources which includes our energy and chemicals team, continues to experience moderating subscription growth due to industry dynamics. Our overall organic growth was also impacted by our non-subscription business. For industrials, which includes our automotive, technology, maritime, and trade and aerospace and defense teams will continue to see strong growth, as reflected in the organic growth of 8% for the quarter. Our horizontal productâs organic revenue growth continues to be impacted by weaker non-subscription revenue.
Now moving to acquisition, since our last call, we closed the acquisition of RootMetrics for approximately $200 million. Purchase multiples were within our typical range. RootMetrics provides highly detailed network analytics on a subscription basis to mobile operators and infrastructure providers in the U.S. and UK and is a great addition to our technology businesses. Todd will provide our updated guidance to reflect this acquisition.
Now, I would like to spend a few minutes sharing with you some initial impressions after my first few weeks back. To begin, most of you will remember that as CEO I was intimately involved in the architecture of our long-term strategy to bring together information, research, and analytics and deliver integrated solutions to customers in separate but interconnected industries. That strategy is the right strategy for IHS and we've made progress.
Additionally, over the last two years, we've put a focus on both the continued evolution of our sales organization and the development of commercial platforms. We will review our progress to-date and make changes as necessary to improve the commercialization of our platforms. There are things that we can do better; we must operate with greater focus and urgency to achieve our potential.
While further work needs to be done in the coming months, we will simplify and tighten operational execution. One example is tighter accountability and organizational alignment between our sales, product management, and marketing teams vertical. This will help us increase speed, clarity, and accountability of decision making. I'm also reviewing our entire non-subscription business as this performance must improve.
There are several things we will stop doing, and perhaps [ph] some of the products or solutions that we will divest all together. For now, we have a lot of work to do over the summer to identify those initiatives that we will accelerate in order to help us execute better. I look forward to sharing the details with you at our investor day in October.
I wanted to spend a few moments talking about the evolution of our capital allocation strategy. This subject is regularly reviewed and discussed by our board, and as a topic on which many of you have provided your thoughts and observations. We've integrated approximately 70 acquisitions since the time of our IPO at the end of 2005, these acquisitions have been important to building capabilities and scale across our core industries.
Acquisitions are and will continue to be an important part of how we provide more comprehensive solutions to customers and drive overall growth. However, the leverage and utility of smaller deals provides less of a payoff and larger acquisitions become much more productive and give us more operating leverage. Going forward, we will concentrate our efforts on larger acquisitions, as we believe this to be the best use of capital at this stage of the companyâs growth and will help to better focus our organization.
In addition, the evolution of our capital allocation strategy warrants a return of capital to our shareholders through a more regular share buyback program. Therefore, we will execute a $500 million share buyback, which is authorized through 2017. This is incremental to the $100 million authorization, we've completed this year. We believe the shift in our capital allocation strategy is the best balance between continuing to scale our business through acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders.
In addition to improving shareholder return from planned stock buybacks, weâre also planning to reduce dilution from shares granted in our stock based compensation program. Weâve made good progress in reducing our stock based compensation expense over the last year and half. We remain committed to continuing this effort and will work to reduce our 2017 annual share purchase [ph] by approximately half of our current year level. The first step will be a reduction in 2016 grants to less than million shares.
I also want to set expectations over the near to medium term given the downturn in the energy end market, we will work to drive subscription organic growth in the mid-single digits and continue to drive margin expansion of at least 100 basis points and cash conversion in the mid-60s. The combination of our unparalleled information assets, intellectual capital, and global infrastructure will enable our company to continue to grow and return greater value to our shareholders for many, many years to come.
With that Iâll turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Thank you, Jerre. Letâs start by reviewing the financial results for the second quarter. Revenue was $591 million, an increase of 4%. Adjusted EBITDA was $185 million, an increase of 7% and represented margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS was $1.50, an increase of 2%. Relative to revenue, we continue to see trends similar to those discussed on the Q1 call.
Our total revenue growth of 4% included 1% organic growth, acquisitions of 6% and an FX drag of 2%. In the quarter, subscriptions represented 78% of revenue and grew organically 5%. Our non-subscription organic revenue declined 12% in Q2 due primarily to energy headwinds.
Looking at regional performance, Americaâs overall revenue growth was 7%, organic growth was 1%, acquisitions added 7% and there was 1% drag from FX. Americaâs organic subscription revenue growth was steady at 6% due primarily to strong industrials performance. EMEAâs overall revenue growth was minus 2%, organic growth was 1%, acquisitions added 2% and there was a 5% drag from FX.
EMEAâs organic subscription revenue growth was 3%.APACâs overall revenue growth was 1%, organic growth was minus 2%, acquisitions added 6% and there was a 2% drag from FX. APACâs organic subscription revenue growth was 4%.
Looking at industry performance, we continue to see strength in our industrials product offerings growth offset by lower resources revenue from market pressure in our energy product offerings. Resources organic revenue growth was minus 4% with organic subscription growth of 2%. Organic non-subs growth was minus 23% and was negatively impacted by lower energy software, consulting and services revenue.
Industrials organic revenue growth was 8%, organic subscription growth was 10% and non-subs growth was 2% and our horizontals organic revenue growth was minus 1% with organic subs growth at 3% and non-subscription growth of minus 14%. Despite pressure in our energy end markets, we continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our resources subscription business.
On a constant currency year-to-date basis, our resources organic subscription base which represents the annualized value of subscription contracts has declined approximately $10 million or about 1% on a subscription base of approximately $750 million. We expect our resources subscriptions to be flat for the remainder of the year. The primary area of subscription based pressure in the quarter came from our smaller accounts.
Turning now to profits and margins, we continue to deliver solid profit and margin expansion. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA totaled $185 million, up 7% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.3% and represented 90 basis points margin expansion in the quarter and our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.2% represented a 110 basis points margin expansion. This performance reflects business model efficiency and focus cost management in this lower growth environment.
In addition, we continue to balance investment in areas such as our automotive offerings, energy asset valuation offerings and selected sales investments to drive future growth in the business. And we continue to see opportunities for future operational efficiencies and margin expansion. Regarding segment profitability, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $143 million. EMEA's $40 million adjusted EBITDA was flat from the year ago quarter and APAC's adjusted EBITDA was $15 million versus $14 million from the year ago quarter.
Turning to adjusted EPS, Q1 increased to $1.50 per diluted share, a $0.03 or 2% improvement over the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was impacted by higher depreciation and interest expense. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 22% and our adjusted tax rate was 29%. Q2 free cash flow was $160 million and represented a conversion rate of 63%.
Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $455 million and represented a conversion rate of 64%. Trailing 12-month returned to a more normal level versus the prior year, which was higher due to improved collections. As previously discussed, we are expecting free cash flow conversion in the mid-60s for the full year.
Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter-end debt balance was $2.129 billion which represented a gross leverage ratio of approximately 2.9 times and we closed the quarter with $226 million of cash. As Jerre discussed, we have completed the $100 million share repurchase authorized earlier in the year, the board has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program through 2017.
The company is committed to using buybacks to return capital to shareholders, this buyback will not compromise our ability to drive growth, pursue strategic M&A or maintain a strong balance sheet. We expect to fund the buyback with our free cash flow and will operate the business at the high end of our stated target leverage range of two to three times.
For our capital policy, weâre willing to lever up to the high threeâs for a specific scaled acquisition and would pause the buyback activity as we delever back to our target leverage range. We believe this policy provides sufficient capital structure flexibility to execute both our return on capital and our growth strategy.
As Jerre also said, we have made progress managing down our stock based compensation expense. Our year-to-date stock based compensation was $68 million which was $12 million less than the prior year. We are now expecting full-year stock based compensation to be approximately $140 million versus 2014 stock based compensation expense of $167 million.
In terms of shares granted, we are expecting 2015 grants of 1.4 million shares and are committing to reduce our annual share grants in 2017 by approximately half of our current year level with the 2016 target of less than million shares. Due to the accounting treatment of stock based compensation expense, which would cost the expense of the underlying share grants to be recognized over the vesting period, we expect annual declines in expense over the coming years in the high single digits.
Weâre revising our guidance to reflect the RootMetrics acquisition; our revised guidance is on an all-in basis and assumes no further acquisitions, currency movements, pension mark-to-market adjustments or unanticipated events. At the mid points, we are increasing our revenue range by $30 million and our adjusted EBITDA range by $8 million.
For 2015, we expect revenue in a range $2.3 billion to $2.34 billion which includes 5% to 6% organic subscription growth and negative non-subscription growth. We expect full year all-in organic growth of 2%. We also expect adjusted EBITDA in a range of $725 million to $740 million and adjusted EPS of $5.80 to $6.
Other than stock based compensation, which I previously discussed, we have slightly adjusted the other components of our guidance which could be found in our press release. In summary, we are encouraged by the resiliency of our energy subscription business which we expect will deliver flat sales growth in an environment where energy stand has been significantly reduced.
We also expect continued strong growth in our industrials product offerings which coupled with the strength of our business model will allow us to continue to deliver margin expansion and solid cash flow in 2015. We believe the capital allocation strategic shift we announced today is the right balance between continuing to use acquisitions to grow the business and returning capital to shareholders.
With that let me turn the call back over to Jerre.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Todd. Iâm pleased to be back leading IHS on the day to day basis and have hit the ground running. Weâre on solid footing and our future is bright. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy in building organic growth and expanding margins with a renewed sense of urgency and focus.
Our energy business has temporary headwinds; however we have great confidence in the long-term growth prospects. Our non-energy business continues to perform well with the diversity of markets helping our overall results. Finally, we intend to drive continued shareholder value through the combination of solid organic growth, margin expansion, key acquisitions and capital returns. Todd and I are now ready to answer your questions. So let us start the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
William A. Warmington
Good morning everyone and welcome back Jerre.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Bill.
William A. Warmington
So congratulations on the capital allocation change. I wanted to ask, given the shift in the capital allocation policy, how quickly do you guys expect to actually deploy that $500 million? And how should we think about our share count guidance of 70 million shares for 2015 and whether that impacts that?
Jerre Stead
So, I will start and I will have Todd pick up on the share count, itâs good questions Bill, thanks. The Board met in a special meeting actually two days after I came back as CEO, and we agreed on a couple of important subjects, one was the $500 million share buyback. That is as we said this morning approved through 2017, and at that point we expect to deliver over â at that period if you think about it, we have got two quarters to go in 2015 four in 2016, 2017.
So itâs 10 quarters, that will depend on two things as to how quickly we exercise the $500 million, one as we said this morning weâre focused going forward on larger acquisitions and depending -- we always will operate with patience and persistence, and depending on how those play out, that may as Todd said cause a pause in the buyback. If it will take longer, we will continue to move forward with the buyback, Todd pick up.
Todd Hyatt
Yes I mean as we said we will fund the buyback with free cash flow, and we will operate at the top end of the two to three times leverage ratio. So, if there arenât actionable acquisitions that are scaled that we talked about, and we will execute the buyback with the available free cash flow, I think that was a practical matter. As we look at this year, weâve completed the $100 million plus some additional shares on the tax withholding related to stock based comp.
So back half of the year is probably not a significant change to the share count that you will see in the 10-Q, but potential to accelerate the buyback in the first half of next year where we generate the majority of our cash flow in the first half of the year. So, I think thatâs really the right way to think about it is to tie it to the free cash flow and to the leverage ratio of the company.
Eric Boyer
Thanks Bill. Next question?
Operator
Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. You may begin.
Andrew W. Jeffrey
Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jerre, it sounds like youâve â you havenât been there in your seat very long, yet it sounds like youâre starting to review perhaps some aspects of the business that you think need to be improved upon.
Iâm wondering if you could elaborate, you mentioned non-subscription revenue for example in some of those businesses whether or not theyâre appropriate longer term as well as I guess more operational efficiencies, more effective integration of operations, et cetera. Are these the long running thoughts and management transition is just crystallizing them or can you just describe maybe in a little bit more detail exactly what you are thinking about?
Jerre Stead
Yes itâs a great question, so let us start with non-subscription issue that we have, I mean if I go back and I look at 2010 which is the last time we hit 1% organic growth, and I hope today is the last time ever that we hit 1% organic growth. Itâs actually quite a different mix. Our total sub base growth in this period, this quarter versus back then was quite a bit higher in total. The difference is a huge deterioration in our non-sub business, and weâre actively looking at every piece of that as I said on my script, there is things that we can do better and we will do better quickly from making sure that weâve got a real clear focus in each of our business units on where we are at on non-sub.
I have been listening to lot of people, your questions are really good ones or it is how long have been we looking at that, if I go back two years ago, we said we are going to get our mix to 80% subscription base, 20% non-sub, weâve done it because weâve failed on the non-sub, not because weâve done strategic things, so we will look at it from two standpoints, short-term operational, and Iâm pretty optimistic that our short term things that we can and will do to improve that, and then secondly as I said we will look across the board at what fits that particular non-sub business, here is the way to think about it.
If it complements what our customers need and complements growing subscription base business, we will do a better job of setting priorities, allocating resources to get the kind of growth back in place that we deserve, if it doesnât we will make conscious decisions of what we should divest.
Our meeting in October on Investor Day, and I hope everybody can be there is the perfect time for us to come back and give you a very clear view of what weâre going to do with that. We will also of course having just completed the Q3 call at the end of September; I think September 29 will be that call, we will give you a pretty good view of where weâre at on short term progress.
So one that needs to be treated, one that has been treated, and one that we will take care of going forward. Second part of your question, Iâm a huge believer in less is best and I am also because I am not very smart always trying to think through how we can do things quickly with two or three priorities, that is where weâre going as fast as we can, we had a very good operations meeting yesterday. I think we set some very clear priorities for the second half of this year and I look forward to sharing those in the months ahead.
The good news from my view is weâve got great people, weâve got great products, wonderful business, we worked, we are fighting the headwinds short term of the energy issue, but as Todd said, itâs a great business, Iâm very proud of the industrialâs 8% organic growth, there is more that we can do there, so total top focus is on what is failing, what is failing right now is full performance in non-sub base and weâll work hard on that.
Eric Boyer
Thanks for the question. Next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may begin.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Hey thank you very much. A couple things I want to just squeeze in here, number one is there any change in all to the organic subscription growth that youâre expecting versus last quarter in other words high end versus low end and then if you could just comment on the status of the Vantage launch that was due officially launched next week?
Jerre Stead
Good questions I mean Todd pick up on both of those all though we had a very active exchange yesterday in the operations meeting on Vantage and Todd pick up on those and I will wrap up on that, as we said in the guidance, weâre still tracking subscription growth range to 5% to 6% for the year. In terms of Vantage, we remain very optimistic about Vantage, we plan to go commercial this quarter, weâre pleased with the feedback and success that we have seen in the market and the receptivity in the market but I think the other reality Shlomo is itâs a tough environment to displace an incumbent.
And so weâve been working our way into accounts alongside the incumbent and so as a result we think that there is opportunity to further penetrate these accounts as we move forward but we will have very little incremental revenue built in to the current guidance relative to Vantage and I think the good news is the new product within the new market for our company and something that the markets receptivity few in terms of the second vendor but I think the challenge in the energy will make the penetration of that market something that will build over the next year plus.
A â Eric Boyer
Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital. You may begin.
Gary Bisbee
Guys good morning and congratulations on the capital allocation and stock comp commentary, I think this is the right thing to do, the question Jerre for you can you give us just updated sort of a progress update maybe on each of the sales realignment and strategic platform strategies, I know that you clearly were an early architect of the strategy and I think maybe some places you have done well, some places not as much as you like but could you just give us amount of success where you are today, thanks.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Gary great question, I would say Iâve spent half my time since I have gotten back on that opportunity, it was interesting yesterday I commented that Todd after the operations meeting, as I listen to all of the people, who are great people working hard itâs clear that weâve got too many cooks in the kitchen.
There is not clear simple lines of accountability or simple way to think about it is I want to be able to go to one person and get the answer everything of we need to do and will do on a global basis on the products in each of those industrial areas, lot of work going on there as I said about half my time in the last three weeks have been spent on that much more to come, our goal is do what we committed to I would say three years ago which is get a world class operation, where we have everybody as I mentioned Gary in my script today everybody operating together in those large business markets that are interdependent on each other and that includes marketing, sales, product management et cetera.
The same time we will work hard to put in place global resources example customer care centers example inside sales, example customer so that we can leverage our scale because that is the opportunity weâve got, it take the things that we do very well on a global basis and complement what we will do very well in the future with the single organization and those large scale businesses.
So feels good as part of that though as I mentioned Todd did, we are also very focused today on larger acquisitions, weâve done like I said 70 over the years since we took the company public almost 10 years ago, we have an opportunity now to be very focused, we will be looking at two to three to four large acquisitions in our portfolio examination.
Iâve been real clear and Todd has with the rest of our organization that the small acquisitions might be interesting but donât spend your time on it, because weâre not going to do it. Weâre are going to do what makes the more sense for share owners and with the scale weâve got today and the ability to use our resources very effectively and if you look back historically, our large acquisitions are the ones that weâve implemented by far the best and integrated them. So thatâs the other piece of what we do as we stand up those global businesses. Thanks, Gary.
Operator
Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may begin.
Manav S. Patnaik
Thank you very much. Good morning everybody and welcome back, Jerre. So firstly thank you for the commentary on the buyback and also for resetting near term expectation. I have two questions. One, on the buyback, did you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program and just to clarify like the $500 million, does that include the regular spend that you guys have been doing to offset option dilution. And then the second part is just, Jerre, around longer term sort of planning, are there plans to appoint another COO and groom or how long do you intent on sort of leading the company again?
Jerre Stead
Let me take that part. Thanks much for the questions, and Iâll have Todd pick up the first part. So we will try to be crystal clear on that. Let me finish the second one first, thatâs okay. Thatâs an easier one, than yours so Iâm giving you more time. Iâm here for a while, while means, Iâm not going to go any place until Iâm a 100% sure that the next organization CEO of this great company is one thatâs got three to four years of fun sailing.
Weâve got lot of things to do, weâve made great progress over the years, we want to build on that. The first thing I send out, like send weekly quotes to all of our colleagues around the world as reminders. First one I sent out was celebrate the past, focus on the future. And thatâs we will do. Weâve got great tempo, the leadership team, then Iâm now supporting is just a great group of people as this in the next two levels in the organization.
It beholds every company certainly with the ours, I think the boardâs biggest job for any organization is to make sure we have very good succession plans in place, starting with the CEO and his or her staff of support and then secondly the strategic plan focus. So we got a lot of work to do and Iâm delighted to be back. Iâve had two years to rest, so my energy level will bring everybody along with me, quick sense of urgency, lot to get done, and weâre just going to focus on making this an ever better operation. Todd, pick up.
Todd Hyatt
Yes, Manav. We certainly, as Jerre said, we talk to the board about capital allocation policy and had the discussion that you referenced in you referenced in your question. We think for us the right place to be right now is at the two to three times operated at the high end of that, that provides the right level of flexibility that we need from a rating agency prospective, from a capital flexibility prospective for larger dealership they arise certainly to the extent that we see leverage start to drop, we will have the ability to move more quickly on the buyback. But for now weâll operate within the two to three times at the high end and use the free cash for the buy. And the other part of your question, yes, it does include the $500 million does include the tax withholding on the stock based comp.
Eric Boyer
Thanks, Manav. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may begin.
Jeffrey P. Meuler
Yes, thank you. Could you provide yourself an update in terms of what you are hearing from the operations folks in the energy vertical over the last three, four months since you last updated us? I know youâve moved beyond the big renewal period but any flavor for how renewal activity is going new sales, up sales, et cetera in the energy vertical.
Jerre Stead
Yes. Great question. Iâll have Todd pick up on that. Because he did give you that three, four months ago. Iâll just start it by saying in the ops review yesterday, I thought very good about where we are positioned on the renewal basis in energy, as you know itâs an interesting time of life in that period. Iâve also spent quite a bit of time looking at whatâs different, the last time the energy world went sub and there is quite a bit of difference this time including our ability to offer a product offerings did not havenât placed last time. So Todd, pick up, though, on what we said three months ago.
Todd Hyatt
Yes Iâll so just a prior to some context for the industry. If you look at the sub, when I talked about this could a bit a very resilient business and certainly the discussions that we would had with our sales organization we have a terrific energy sales organization, but the challenges have been really in the last quarter more at the lower end of the market I reference this in my comments. The larger our renewals are getting down, there is not significant price uplift on those but they are getting down, certainly slightly up versus prior year, talked about on year-to-date basis, but subscription base which is the basically the annualized value of the all of the sales and we about to have $750 million energy sub base year-to-date thatâs down $10 million.
We expect that, that would basically be flat for the year so, we are looking at the flat sales growth level in what is a very challenging environment and where we would seems significant budget cost across the board, I think the larger environment there is moderation now as companies have completed their budget process. There is - there a building structure to support what is lower price environment, but even in terms of the energy price we do see, forecast internally of the price environment of $55 to $70. So, some level of moderation and I think some expectation that will start to see a level of exploration activity for next year.
When we look at the non-subs environment itâs stable, but it is stable at lower level then last year. In non-subs itâs really been impacted more significantly by budgetary pressures. That the most significant impact that we have in non-subs is in our software our exploration software and that has been a very, very challenged product set for this year. And we do see bills that are out there as we look at the second half of the year, but we have see that is return to some level of growth in 2016 and then consulting we have a backlog with good visibility pipeline, with the sales level but stable but itâs stable at the lower level and so we expect that to carry on through the year.
The other thing Iâll add, if you look at non-subs sequentially versus year-over-year, non-subs sequentially did have a pretty big pickup. So we had very strong events and we had a very solid CERAWeek I think weâre slightly up on revenue in CERAWeek and we had 5% up on CERAWeek revenue and really encouraging in terms of the dialogue that Dan organ and his organization had with many of the leaders in the energy industry. So we continued feel good about our market position in energy.
Jerre Stead
Great comments, Todd critical question for us. The other thing I felt good about yesterday in Todd right, we have a world class sales organization in total but certainly in energy. The renewals are actually saw some price realization meaning price increased with some of the larger renewals and in total there is pressurize you would expect, but in total worth of renewals, the renewals are at least flat not deflated in many cases some price realization so that feels good going forward, thanks for the question. Next question?

Our next question is from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Andre Benjamin
Thanks, good morning. As one of the follow up on the strategic review on the non-sub business want to know in particular are there any that you piece that but you think a most likely to be shut down and sold. Is there any color on how much youâre willing to strength that grow and if the weakness in energy is believe to be cyclical, can you help us understand, why making portfolio changes at the bottom of the cycles the right thing to do or is it that some of these changes in more â do you know?
Jerre Stead
Yes, Iâll have to prompt upon the last part of your question on when the right time as from the cyclicality stand point. We are in the process as I said of looking at every piece, part of that is our need to be more focused internally and we will work that hard, we will look at and I looking at each of the pieces from a ongoing strategic standpoint, the critical lens is are those businesses very important in complementary for our customers that will lead over time to increase total organic growth in our sub base. So weâre in that process, certainly as I said by the time we are to have October Investor Day, we will have very clear traction on that. And till then we will work through it and make announcements as it makes sense going forward that.
Todd pickup on the low end of the cyclicality.
Todd Hyatt
Well we like our energy business, Andre so we are talking about portfolio valuation and evaluating the non-subs, weâre certainly not talking about core elements of the energy business. On the past, weâve talked about a box storage business that lives in energy, so really very non-strategic but in terms of energy, automotive our large scale sectors those are businesses we like a lot, they generate significant profit for the company. Those are businesses that we will look to continue to grow and I think when we look at energy, when we look at the performance today but we look at it historically, energy has been really a foundational part of our portfolio and has for the most part led the companyâs growth over the last decade.
And we would expect that to be the case in the future, so weâre not talking about making adjustments to the core elements of our portfolio. We are talking about or looking at some of the non-strategic non-sub areas that are outside of those core elements of automotive and energy.
Jerre Stead
Thanks Todd and I would just add one piece on that as I think about it. Last time we went through this 2009, 2010 when we went into it, our energy business we were then reporting two things, engineering and energy, our energy business was about 60% of the total revenue one of the strategies we talked about back then was to grow other parts of our business strategically and I am very pleased we have done that as Todd said I think a little under 40% of our total revenue now comes out of energy despite good growth with energy as Todd said where it has grown in the last four years.
So we are in a better position than we have been before to offset the cyclicality that I am sure it is going to continue for many years to come in energy world. So that feels good. Thanks next question.

Our next question is from Joe Foresi with Janney. You may begin.
Robert Simmons
Hi thanks. This is Robert Simmons on for Joe. So on those order acquisitions, wondering if you could give color on your thought process in terms of what you are looking for in target, how do you define slow ones â ones that are and anything else like that?
Jerre Stead
Great thing, great question thanks. I am going to let Todd pick up on that, lot of time talking about and I think we have got a very clear step forward, Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Well couple of core things we would look at, one certainly industry and scaling critical parts of our portfolio I referenced energy, automotive earlier we have made some level of investment in technology and we like the telecom space with RootMetrics which was not a super large but $200 million deal. But I think industries that we can continue to scale business model very important, foundational that we have strong subscription business and then also a business that that we have ability to drive other revenue streams on.
So core foundational subscription business that we can drive additional analytic capabilities and offerings. So if you think of Vantage as an example for energy, Vantage to me is an analytic offerings that gets build on the core foundational subscription business.
Obviously we would look for acquisitions that can be accretive in a immediate period of time and we think that given the capital structure, our flexibility we have that we would have the finance in a manner that would allow us to drive accretion. And then of course I think all of those things tie back to generating cash that allow us to continue to grow the business, but those are from the finance lens, so I mean Jerre, I donât knowâ¦
Jerre Stead
No. Perfect again, I think a very few of you and what weâre doing as I said patience and persistence were larger ones. I would just add two things, we've really worked hard to make sure those are cultural effect and weâll continue to work on that, when we make the acquisitions. The other thing Iâd say that if you think about scale, itâs got to fit our business model as Todd said, but weâll set, not weâll, have set targets of looking at from my accretive standpoint, I ask Todd and his team to look at everyone of those acquisitions based on all share deal first. Why? Because money is cheap today and I want to make sure itâs accretive long-term.
It doesnât mean that we reduce our shares to make the acquisition, what it means is that we are accretive if we did which will make it more accretive to use all cash and leverage our balance sheet because I donât want us to get fooled like Iâm watching some other companies today with cheap money buying something thatâs accretive because the money is cheap, that wouldnât be long term. Thanks, great question.

Our next question comes from Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Anjaneya K. Singh
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Iâm wondering if you can help us understand the momentum in the industrials category a bit more, how do you expect the trend with tougher comps in the back half of this year and can you give us an update on the verticals that are driving that acceleration sequentially. If you can also touch on your international business, itâs seeing margin expansion despite the decelerating organic subs growth, I would appreciate that. Thanks.
Jerre Stead
Yep, no great. Todd?
Todd Hyatt
So when we look at the industrials, automotive has been very strong and we expect that to continue, Iâve been asked the question about the tough comps year-over-year, I mean, remember even when we report something exquisitely in the prior year and moves into organic is looking at the same comps. So those tough comps that you talk about in the second half, those have really been here all year. I mean weâre comparing Q1 to the Q1 performance from the prior year.
So not really concerned about tough comps, I mean, I see the business continuing to perform very well, but automotive has been very strong, maritime has been a very solid performer and certainly with a global trade acquisition last year, we expect that to be a very solid grower, and A&D was hurting us if we go back a couple of years ago, it was negative A&D is no longer a drag and I give Blake and his team a lot of credit, but I think weâve built a very stable business there, that has ability to actually grow a bit. And then technology, the subscription part of technology has been a incredible performer as well. So good balance throughout the horizontals portfolio but certainly, auto was the largest piece of that portfolio and it is definitely leading the growth, and we would expect that to continue.
Eric Boyer
Thank you. Next question.

Our next question is from Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.
John D. Crowther
Yes. You've got John Crowther on for Peter. Quickly, a follow-up to that last question on the strength in automotive. Maybe you can talk a little bit about RL Polk and Carfax in terms of the ability to take that internationally, and the growth and expansion you're seeing there. And then as a follow-up, Jerre, I think you said that you're looking for 100 basis points of margin expansion, at least 100 basis points, year over year. I'm just wondering, it looks like the guidance for this year assumes 50 basis points. Maybe you could just remind us again what's going on near term versus those longer-term expectations. Thanks.
Jerre Stead
Well, good question. Iâll have Todd pick up the first part in just a second. Our goal has been and will continue to be at least a 100 basis points improvement year-over-year, thatâs what Iâm seeing but the productivity efforts we got underway and will accelerate, in times where we donât get the higher organic growth weâd like to, the beauty of this business model is that, we can leverage and will to get the margin improvement going forward. Todd, pickup on the 50 basis points because I think we include that up for it now.
Todd Hyatt
Iâm sorry the 50 basis points
John D. Crowther
You said it looks like inside of our guidance, itâs 50 basis points.
Todd Hyatt
Can you ask the question again just so I make sure Iâm clear on what the point is?
John D. Crowther
What you have said was I had said minimum of 100 basis points is whatâs really talked about. You said if you look at the guidance is assumption was 50 basis points.
Todd Hyatt
I think if you take midpoint of guidance probably I did something closer to 80 points. So, if I look at the midpoints of the guidance, but I think itâs right at midpoint around 80 ultimately the mix between the revenue and the profit we will certainly deliver I think within the range and I think somewhere between 80 and 100 is going to be the number for this year and Jerre and what I would expect.
John D. Crowther
And with you and me doing a best to help, but it will be closer to the 100 and just the 80
Todd Hyatt
We talk about previously about 100 points of margin expansion being pulled driven from the model and I think there is opportunity with operating efficiencies that we have to continue to drive that 100 and actually even accelerate that margin into the future.
John D. Crowther
And Todd the first part of this question [indiscernible] is the international market.
Todd Hyatt
Yes that was the part that I was focus.
John D. Crowther
Iâm sorry.
Todd Hyatt
So the question was around Polk in automotive international so we have a pretty solid international automotive business. The production part of that business has been very strong internationally for some period of time. I think your point, is a good point that about to Polk and the Carfax assets very US-centric businesses. We have made good progress with polka as far as combining some of the Polk market data in various international geographic with IHS production information to create some new product offerings.
We do see our continued opportunity to grow Polk on an international basis and certainly would expect that will be a future source of growth. That the Carfax business that the time we acquired that we talked about a small business in continental Europe single digit revenue that really still as the primarily the case and there are some markets that we can expand in but frankly when I look at Carfax and I look at the broader automotive portfolio I think that the international expansion is not at the top of the growth levers that we have. We have significant growth levers that exist domestically and will continue to execute on those levers in the near future.
As far as international margin, international margin tends to be pretty closely tighter to revenue performance and revenue growth tends to fall through at a pretty high level of conversion internationally. This year weâve done a very good job of managing cost and ensuring that we have deliver to an acceptable level of margin and what has been a lower growth environment. So part of which you see is just better cost management.

Our next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Toni M. Kaplan
Thanks. Welcome back Jerre.
Jerre Stead
Thank you, Toni.
Toni M. Kaplan
Thank you. Just want to confirm I heard you correctly earlier Todd. I think you have mention total organic growth of 2% embedded in the guidance down from I think those 2% to 3% last quarter. It is showing also confirm are you still assuming $75 decline for FX embedded in the guidance and finally just resources I think deteriorated this quarter little bit so I just wanted to kneel down, why you think that it gets better in the second half of the year. Thanks.
Todd Hyatt
Yes, I did say 2% as far as all organic thatâs our best view of the business for the remainder of the year. As far as what was the second part of the question?
Jerre Stead
FX.
Toni M. Kaplan
FX, weâve said 75. FX was improved marginally so but I would call it in as $65 million, $75 million range. Resources, basically what we found the quarter resources subscription was down the sub base in resources giving the renewal of the timing of renewals, we had a pretty direct correlation to the revenue number, we would expect that number, it was mid-twos in Q2, we would expect that number to move down sequentially and basically get to the point of what has happened with the sub base for the year and then weâll build out of that next year.
Eric Boyer
Thanks, Toni. Next question.

Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO. You may begin.
Henry S. Chien
Hi, good morning. Itâs Henry Chien for Jeff. I just wanted to follow up on the question on, your M&A strategy. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit as you look through portfolio what industry do you think are particularly attracted for similar larger acquisitions you may be looking at. Thanks.
Jerre Stead
Yes. Thanks. Todd, pick up and follow back on what we said, I mean clearly as we build scale in the global markets that weâve focused on, that will continue to be the pick up on it.
Todd Hyatt
Yes. We like our scaled positions that we have in both energy and automotive and we would see opportunity to further scale both of those, RootMetrics was a $200 million acquisition technology is a pretty small part of the portfolio, that there may be opportunities in that part of the portfolio, I think from my perspective though coming back automotive energy further scaling business was that already have a level of scale had very deep and strong customer relationships where market leaders and both of those and their attractive assets in both of those areas I see those as probably be the best opportunity to further scale.
Jerre Stead
Well said. Thank you. Next question.
Operator
Our next question is from Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
Ato Garrett
Thank you very much for taking my question. Again relating to the M&A strategy, just thinking about now, you are going to have to focus on these larger scale acquisitions and subsequently integrating these acquisitions, how does that dovetail with your, what the plans of getting with the rollout of their new product platforms and then previously stated target of getting like the grand majority of 80% and 90% of the revenues on those platforms by the end of the year. Do you think thatâs going to push them back, as you take on new asset?
Jerre Stead
Note the question, Todd.
Todd Hyatt
I think it actually hits really well with that strategy. Larger deals tend to come with a level of operation maturity process and in some ways can be, there can actually be an easier path can integrate certain elements. So I think we look at Polk and IHS Automotive weâd done a very good job, integrating those businesses. So to date weâve referenced in the energy inside world that we brought on believe nine different product platforms on to IHS connect.
And so, if we acquire an energy asset that needs to come on to that platform that obviously would be single platform. So when I think about it from a systems perspective, itâs probably less about size, it becomes more about number of products and differences in the underlying products that technology from a system perspective is less about, number of transactions and more about number of systems. So I think it actually facilitates that strategy.
Jerre Stead
Well, and thatâs one of the lenses we are looking through. Thank you. Next question.

Our next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. You may begin.
Shlomo H. Rosenbaum
Hi, thank you for squeezing me in for one last one. Jerre, just to be clear, usually when there is a CEO transition, there could be a hiatus in M&A in terms of the continuity and making sure that you are looking at things appropriately before you go and buy anything. Given your kind of stepping back into that roll, do you expect a similar type of hiatus or do you feel like you are closing up to the business that if something big came up, you are fully ready to move forward on that in the near term.
Jerre Stead
A great question. Good one to wrap up on this morning. Iâve stayed quite close with the large acquisitions that we have looked at and continue to look at. As I mentioned earlier at the beginning, thatâs with larger acquisitions itâs always patience and persistence. These are not new things that come up on our screen, these are opportunities that weâve looked at for years and thatâs really where we are at today. So some of those potential larger acquisitions that weâre talking about I actually started the discussion what people with those four, five years ago. So, I am quite keen, I see no hiatus on anything that was doing today of anything weâll do our best to moving and quicker and simpler going forward.
Again, if you look back historically since we left public about every two years we have made at that time significantly larger acquisition Jane's happened to be the first global inside SMT Polk and I could go on and on, on. So do you think about thatâs for on 8 years and this year ten, those are those kind of acquisitions as Todd thatâs his great job of explaining that once weâre looking at those are the kind we are looking at and will go forward very focused on it. We hope to play out but stay patient with us and persistent because at the right time we'll deliver the kind of returns for our share owners based on those acquisitions.
Thank you all very much look-forward to talking with you soon. Todd, do you want to wrap up?
