Greetings. And welcome to the QEP Resources Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. William Kent, Director of Investor Relations for QEP Resources. Please go ahead, sir.
William Kent - Director-Investor Relations
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources fourth quarter 2015 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you've not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our earnings release which contains tables with our financial results along with the slide presentation with maps and other supporting material.
In today's conference call, we use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings, and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly give you some color about our financial results and guidance for 2016, and then turn the call over to Chuck.
As you know, 2015 was a dramatically different year from 2014. QEP and the rest of the industry dealt with volatile and significantly lower commodity prices, capital markets that were (1:54) and an unclear view of the future. In response, we focused on controlling what we could control. We reduced our capital spending, retightened our belts, and we preserved our liquidity.
Turning to our results. For the full year 2015, we generated $1,029 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $1,438 million from continuing operations in 2014. Our fourth quarter EBITDA was $254 million which compared to $273 million in the third quarter of the year and $366 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Factors driving our fourth quarter production included production which is 84 Bcfe or 2.7 Bcfe lower than the 86.7 Bcfe we reported in the third quarter of the year. Oil volumes were 5.1 million barrels, down slightly from the third quarter levels, and NGL volumes were 1.3 million barrels, which is the same as in the third quarter. Natural gas volumes were 46 Bcf, down 2 Bcf from the third quarter, and crude oil comprise 36% of our total production in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was the same percentage as in the third quarter of the year in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Our guidance for oil volumes for 2016 is 18.5 million barrels to 20.5 million barrels, the midpoint of which is down negligibly from the 19.6 million barrels produced in 2015. Our guidance for NGL volumes for 2016 is 4 million barrels to 5 million barrels, the midpoint of which is down slightly from 2015, and assumes that we'll be in ethane rejection all year. Our guidance for natural gas volumes for 2016 is 165 Bcf to 175 Bcf, a decline of approximately 6% at the midpoint of the range from 181 Bcf produced in 2015, reflecting reduced drilling activity in Pinedale and the Uinta Basin and continued decline in Haynesville. Chuck will give you more color about drivers of our production guidance for 2016 in a few moments.
QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price, which includes the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $5.47 per Mcfe which was $0.03 lower than we realized in the third quarter and $1.65 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the fourth quarter 2014. The equivalent price reflects field-level natural gas prices that were $2.29 or $0.40 per Mcfe lower. Field-level NGL prices that were $14.41 a barrel or $1.56 a barrel higher and field-level crude oil prices that were $38.16 a barrel or $2.85 a barrel lower than their respective levels in the third quarter of the year.
Field-level crude oil revenues account for 61% of total field-level revenues, which was 2% higher than the third quarter of the year, and the same as in the fourth quarter of 2014. QEP Energy's derivative portfolio added $143 million of proceeds or $1.70 per Mcfe in the quarter, up $23 million from the third quarter and up $70 million from the fourth quarter of 2014.
QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $140 million in the quarter, up from $137 million in the third quarter of the year and down from $143 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.75 per Mcfe, which is up $0.10 per Mcfe from the third quarter and transportation expense was $0.92 per Mcfe which is flat to the third quarter.
Our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses for full year 2016 is $1.60 to $1.70 per Mcfe. G&A expenses were $40.4 million in the quarter, down $1.6 million from the third quarter. For the year, G&A was $181 million, down $23 million from 2014. In 2015, we incurred restructuring costs of about $8 million, which includes the costs to close our Tulsa office. We also incurred about $11 million of non-cash expense associated with freezing our pension plan.
Cash G&A expense was about $134 million, down 23% compared to $176 million in 2014. Our guidance for G&A expense for full year 2016 is $150 million to $160 million, of which approximately $35 million is non-cash expense. For 2015, we reported $149 million net loss. Contributing to the net loss was $56 million of impairments of proven and unproven properties and goodwill, driven by lower forward commodity prices. We also recorded $184 million of unrealized loss on derivatives, reflecting the significantly lower value of our commodity derivatives portfolio at yearend 2015 compared to 2014. In addition, DD&A expense was $114 million lower in 2015 than in 2014.
On January 1, 2016, we terminated the contracts for commodity resale and marketing transactions between QEP Energy and QEP Marketing. They signed a relevant third party agreement for QEP Energy. This change will simplify our business processes and financial statements, and they have no impact on operating income, adjusted EBITDA or net income. If you have questions, we can discuss further in Q&A.
Capital expenditures on a accrual basis for E&P, drilling and completion activities were just north of $1 billion. In addition, we reported just under $100 million for acquisitions. Excluding the acquisitions, we are forecasting the midpoint of 2016 capital spending to be $475 million, which is a reduction of over 50% from the level of capital expenditures in 2015.
Yearend proved reserves were 3.6 Tcfe, down only 8% from the yearend 2014. Negative revisions were 1.1 Tcfe of which 757 Bcfe were price related and 320 Bcfe were driven by our expected reduced level of capital spending over the next five years. However, extensions and discoveries added 1.1 Tcfe, replacing 340% of production. 58% of the proved reserves were developed and 58% of the equivalent proved reserves were natural gas. Average PV-10 of the proved reserve was $2.5 billion and the pre-tax income PV-10 of the reserves was $3.1 billion.
With regard to our balance sheet, at the end of the year, total assets were $8.4 billion and shareholder equity was about $3.9 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.2 billion, all of which were our Senior Notes. At the end of the year, we had $376 million of cash, and no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which we amended in November of last year. If you have questions about our revolving credit facility, we can discuss further in Q&A.
I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Since Richard's already discussed our 2015 financial results, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of our key accomplishments for 2015, share with you our ongoing response to the current commodity price environment, and then review each of our core areas to share some recent operational highlights and give our 2016 operating plans. And then, we'll move on to Q&A.
Operationally, 2015 was a solid year for QEP despite the commodity price headwinds confronting our industry and our company. We were quick to respond to the decline in commodity prices, rapidly reducing our operated rig count and pushing hard on service providers and suppliers for price concessions while remaining focused on operational efficiency and capital discipline. The result was a 41% reduction in 2015 capital expenditures compared to 2014, excluding acquisitions.
We also took significant steps to reduce overall G&A expense, as Richard mentioned, throughout the year, which will benefit us for years to come. We realigned our business by centralizing all of our asset management teams here in our Denver corporate headquarters in the second half of last year. We also meaningfully reduced the use of outside contractors, and we reaffirmed our corporate culture of accountability with a laser focus on safety, cost control and superior operational execution.
While we dramatically cut our capital investment program in 2015, our assets continued to perform quite strongly. Our Williston Basin assets continued to exceed our internal forecasts and the projections we made when we made the acquisition back in 2012, and our Permian Basin assets began to hit their operational stride. The quality of these assets combined with outstanding operational execution helped drive a 14% year-over-year increase in crude oil production to 19.6 million barrels and contributed to record year-end estimated proved crude oil reserves of 193 million barrels.
Financial discipline has been a cornerstone of QEP's corporate strategy since our inception, and 2015 was no different. We continued to focus our efforts on maintaining our strong liquidity position and financial flexibility throughout the year. We exited 2015 with over $375 million in cash, an undrawn revolver, and a top-tier asset portfolio. As we enter 2016, we will continue to focus our efforts on controlling costs and operational efficiency, and on maintaining our financial flexibility, so that we will not only survive the current downturn but be ready to take advantage of opportunities when commodity prices improve.
We don't believe that it is wise to consume our liquidity to drive production growth at the current commodity price despite our solid financial footing. And we remain focused on living within our means. While commodity price volatility and uncertainty around capturing additional savings from well cost reductions and, by the way, we think there are more savings to come, makes it a difficult and an inexact science. We will try to manage our capital program to stay as close as possible to cash flow.
As you've seen from our 2016 guidance that we published yesterday, we are making drastic cuts to our 2016 drilling and completion activity in response to current commodity prices as we don't think it makes sense to aggressively consume the highest-return assets in our portfolio.
Today, we have six QEP-operated rigs working across our acreage, and we will be at three operated rigs early in the second quarter. Commensurate with this reduction in activity, we are reining in capital spending by over 50% from 2015 levels to between $450 million and $500 million to match forecasted cash flow based on current forward prices.
2016 oil production is forecasted to be relatively flat compared with 2015, and our natural gas production should trend down slightly year-over-year as we're allocating less capital to our gas projects. Finally, although a small step, we have decided to indefinitely suspend our cash dividend, which amounts to about $14 million per year, to further preserve cash and provide us with additional financial flexibility.
Now let me provide you some color on our recent operational results by area, and our details for our 2016 capital program. As I do so, you can refer to the slide presentation that accompanied our release yesterday afternoon. In Williston Basin, net production averaged approximately 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the fourth quarter, which was down slightly from the third quarter because of offset completion activity that resulted in shut-ins and curtailments of some nearby producing wells. We completed and turned to sales 10 gross operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 78%, all on South Antelope. We also participated in 16 gross non-operated Bakken/Three Forks wells that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter.
We continue to be quite pleased with the performance of the initial group of high-density infill pilot wells we completed and turned to sales about nine months ago on our South Antelope acreage. These wells evaluated both 400-foot and 600-foot high-density infill well spacing, and they also tested the second bench of the Three Forks formation. During the quarter, we turned to sales five additional high-density wells spaced at 600 feet in the same area.
The cumulative production performance of these wells continues to track closely to the performance of our enhanced completion design which you will recall was roughly a 50-stage 1,000 pounds of proppant per foot completion design. And more importantly, the cumulative production from these wells continues to outperform the original parent wells that were spaced at four wells per reservoir per 1,280-acre unit.
On average, the infill pilot wells have delivered 240-day cumulative production of about 205,000 barrels of oil equivalent. You can see the details of the current performance of this family of wells on slide 9. During the quarter, we continued to conduct tests on the second bench of the Three Forks wells at South Antelope. And we turned four additional wells to sales with average 24-hour IP's of 2,665 barrels of oil equivalent a day. You can see the aggregate performance of all of our Three Forks second bench wells on slide 10.
We also turned to sales our first third bench test of the Three Forks formation at South Antelope in the fourth quarter, and that well had an IP of a little over 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The well continues to show very promising early-time performance. And it seems to be closely tracking the production performance of first and second bench Three Forks wells and of our Middle Bakken wells. You really can't differentiate the performance of the third bench. You can see the early-time performance of this well on slide 10.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the completion techniques that we're utilizing and that many other operators are utilizing across the Basin, we continue to pump about 1,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot over roughly 50 stages in all of our wells, and we're convinced that the enhanced completions are critical to maximizing the recovery of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks petroleum system.
We continue to make progress driving down well cost in the Williston. Current AFE gross drilled and completed well cost for the South Antelope acreage average about $6 million with cost associated with facilities and artificial lift adding approximately $800,000 per well on average.
As I highlighted on our last several calls, and as you can see over the past two quarters or the production data, as we infill South Antelope, we're going to have more offset well shut-ins which are going to introduce more quarter-to-quarter production variability. We expect our operated rig count on South Antelope to drop from the three rigs that we had at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 to one rig early in the second quarter of 2016.
Turning to the Permian Basin. Net production during the third quarter averaged 13,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that's about 84% liquids. That production is up 5% from last quarter and 42% from the fourth quarter of last year.
The Spraberry continues to outperform our initial expectations. We completed and turned to sales five gross-operated horizontal wells in the fourth quarter, one well targeting the Spraberry Shale and the other four targeted the Middle Spraberry. And as we reported in the release, four of those five wells reached peak production during the quarter and all four delivered quite strong results.
We continue to make progress driving down well cost in the Permian Basin. The current AFE gross average drilled and completed well cost for Spraberry wells is $5.7 million with additional cost for facilities and artificial lift adding about $700,000 per well.
We had two operated rigs working in the Permian Basin at the end of the fourth quarter and we expect to have one rig in the Permian by the end of the first quarter of this year. You can refer to slides 12 through 15 for additional details on our Permian properties.
Turning briefly to Pinedale, net production averaged 304 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day during the fourth quarter. And that's about 14% liquids. We added 24 new completions in the quarter, and as a result, we reached an all-time record for QEP operated natural gas production from our Pinedale asset.
As with all our operating areas, we continue to make progress driving down well cost at Pinedale. The current gross AFE costs for a drilled and completed well, at Pinedale, our average is about $2.9 million, with costs associated with facilities and plunger lift adding another $200,000 per well on average.
We had three operated rigs at Pinedale at the end of the fourth quarter. And we are at one rig today at Pinedale. And we'll continue to run one rig for the remainder of this year. You can see the details of our Pinedale asset on slide 16.
In the Uinta Basin, net production averaged 71 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, comprised of about 21% liquids during the fourth quarter. About 43 million cubic feet per day of that production was from our Lower Mesaverde play. During the quarter, we continued to focus on drilling and completion optimization, and it's yielding encouraging results in the Lower Mesaverde.
Our most recent horizontal well exhibited strong peak production early in the fourth quarter while drilling and completion days and well costs continued to decrease. Production performance from the previous pad of eight directional vertical wells that we drilled to the Lower Mesaverde, which we completed at the end of the second quarter 2015, continues to be quite solid. These wells have achieved over 3.5 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent aggregate cumulative gross production after 224 days online, and that's with the just refrigeration-processing.
We had one operated rig in the Uinta at the end of the fourth quarter drilling on an eight well directional vertical pad targeting the Lower Mesaverde. We don't expect to have any operated rigs running in Uinta Basin for the remainder of this year. You can see details of our Uinta Basin asset on slide 17.
Our fourth quarter results demonstrate our ability to continue to optimize production performance and increase operating efficiency while allocating capital to our highest return assets in our portfolio. As we look toward 2016, we're clearly operating in a challenging environment, not only for us, but for the entire oil and gas industry, and we responded by dramatically rating in our 2016 capital program to match cash flow as we continue to look for opportunities to squeeze even more costs out of our business.
We will also work very hard to position ourselves firmly in the survivor camp, but also we've not lost focus on our core goal of improving the quality and depth of our future development inventory through continued innovation, superior execution, a relentless emphasis on cost and efficiency, and on identifying and driving development of organic opportunities within our asset portfolio.
With that, Kevin, we can now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Brian Corales from Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil
Good morning, guys, and congratulations on those Bakken wells. They look awesome. On those density tests, can you â I mean, is there a conclusion that you've made? Obviously, the wells look very good. Is going forward are you all going to be drilling all three benches at 400-foot or 600-foot? Are you still testing? And when do you think you could get there if you're not there yet?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, Brian, we're still testing at least for the deeper benches. Obviously, we have one very encouraging third bench test. We need to test the third bench over our broader acreage position and really focused on South Antelope. We don't think the third bench is economic over on the Fort Berthold acreage, but obviously, we haven't tested it there. But I'm less optimistic over there.
So we need to get more spatial sampling of the third bench, and then what the team is leaning toward now is a staggered development of the second and third bench or wine rack pattern, and whether it's a 600-feet or 400-feet still an open question. Obviously, one of the things that we've talked about on previous calls is that the core data and the log data don't match the production performance of these deeper bench wells. So we're still trying to collect additional data just to inform us on how much oil there is in the system, and frankly where it's coming from.
We don't think that we have all the data that we need to make an informed decision yet. But obviously, we're very excited by, not only the third bench test, which granted a short duration with the ongoing good performance of the second bench wells that we now have 10 wells of that had been online for various periods of time we continue to show good performance. So 600-feet spacing ultimately is probably the right answer, although it might be tighter in some of the benches depending on what we learn with the additional data we're collecting.
Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil
And the 400-feet, does that even consider the third bench or the second bench?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It considers the second bench on a staggered basis. It does not consider the third bench. So we'll see how that number evolves over time.
Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil
And one more quick one. Why are rig in the Pinedale versus Uinta? Is it all rate of return? Is it you've been in the Pinedale forever? Is there a reason there?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The returns are about the same. We continue to drive down the costs at Pinedale. The Pinedale core, where we're drilling now on the northern part of the field, it's an area called Steward Point, is some of the best rock and some of the best well performance in the entire Pinedale Anticline field, including the acreage to the south that's not operated or, in which we don't own an interest.
The new frac design that we've talked about on previous calls with the 100 mesh sand has continued to show outperformance over our historic completion design. So we like the results we're getting there, and we think that the returns there are competitive with that, frankly of the oil plays at current prices and of our other gas plays.
Brian Michael Corales - Scotia Howard Weil
All right, guys. Thank you.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brian.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Tameron from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, Chuck, good morning. I'd echo nice quarter and congrats on getting ahead of this last year and pulling back before others did, which leads to my next question which is on the flipside. When you look at the organization today, I assume there's been some attrition and some people laying down that right size it to a smaller program. How do you think about the flipside? If and when prices return how quickly can you add people like what today's infrastructure and people, what does that look like as far as rig count? Could you just talk more about coming out of this on the other side?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, David. It's a great question because obviously when we look at today's price environment, we don't think it's sustainable. The open question is how long does it stay down before it starts to recover. One of our areas of focus has been on trying to preserve human capital because obviously, in the go go days, we fought to recruit and retain talented people, and we're trying to do as much as we can to keep the core team together.
Obviously, one of the frustrating things is we have many very talented and experienced contractors that work for us that come and go with the commodity price, and with the ups and downs of rig counts. And obviously, Jim and his team have â one of their core focuses is on keeping track of those folks and making sure that they are ready to come back. And we have great relationships with those contractors and we're optimistic we can get them back when things improve.
One of the things as we look at G&A, I think we've done a fantastic job of driving down cash G&A costs. And it's been â we've had some attrition. We've cut some staff in order to right size the organization for the current environment, but we've also focused our people on â we constantly look at the screen like I'm sure everybody on this call does and look at commodity prices, look at the stock price, and we try to encourage our employees to focus on the things that we can control, and a lot of that is variable costs, travel costs, consumption of various supplies, et cetera, in the field. And as we've really gotten people focused on that, they've come through in a remarkable way and helping us drive down our cash, non-employee G&A costs dramatically.
We're also â we're looking at ways that we can do more with less in the field, and we've asked our field operators to stretch. But one of the things that I would remind you is commodity prices are down, but the number of wells that we produce doesn't change, and there's still a large number of our employees involved with operating our wells and optimizing production.
And they're focused on maximizing production, maximizing recovery from the wells that we've already drilled and completed is absolutely critical in a low price environment. So we're asking those folks to do more, to squeeze more out of their existing operation. And we can't lose sight of the fact that the producing well count hasn't changed. We all tend to focus on rig count, and that's only part of the story.
So we're doing everything we can to maintain the organization and be ready to respond. We think that â look, we've operated as many as, Jim, 30 rigs in the peak.
Jim E. Torgerson - Executive Vice President, QEP Energy, QEP Resources, Inc.
Over 30 rigs.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Over 30 rigs in the peak. We have an organization which flexes up and down and has done it before. And I think we're in a position to do it again.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Good or thorough answer. I guess, we'll call it good answer as well.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Long answer.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just one follow-up. Just getting back to the Bakken. It seems like yourselves â like you talked about having some well impact from offset wells being shut in. I've seen some other language similar from other Bakken players, and I'm trying to reconcile that. You talked about rig count versus well count and maybe that's what it gets to. But I'm trying to reconcile how you go from 200 rigs to 60 rigs and then somehow still manage to have offset type impact, is that just everybody's drilling more in a tighter area, can you just talk about the dynamic up there.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think one of the beauties of our â and it's been a strategic focus of ours from the beginning, has been to core up acreage and have a nice contiguous block of acreage that we can maximize operational efficiencies on, i.e., not move around as much. So we put a rig on a pad, drill a bunch of wells, move the rig out, bring in a frac crew and complete all of those wells.
That's the most cost effective way to drill and complete in resource plays. You're not jumping around over a scattered acreage position. It also allows for efficiencies in well connects, midstream operations, et cetera. That's the positive side. The negative side is that when you have a concentrated acreage position, you have trouble "getting away from yourself" and so you end up with offset frac interference being a significant issue both in planning and in forecasting production volumes.
So I think our team has gotten pretty good at planning for these offset frac interference activities, but also in forecasting for it. We tried to give you strong indications that you should expect more volatility. So that's us and I mean you just look at our map of our Bakken assets, and you can see they're concentrated. And what I would say is that for other operators, everybody has moved into the core. And one of the â by moving into the core, not only are they interfering with themselves, but they're interfering with other operators who offset them as well. We've seen some of that where other operators have come around the periphery of our South Antelope acreage and completed wells. So you don't see it in our operated rig count or in our operated activity, you'd have to understand who's next door and what they're doing to understand.
And then probably the most important point that I should've brought out at the beginning, in our particular instance, we're infilling a four-well per reservoir per spacing unit original pattern. So by definition, we're going to hit â we're going to impact the production performance from all those original parent wells when we come back in and infill. In some instances, we have to shut the producing wells in while we're drilling because of the proximity to the rig and to the frac spread. So it's not just a completion activity, it's during the whole time that we're drilling the wells, just because of the nature of pad drilling.
So, for us, it's concentrated acreage which is a good thing, but it introduces volatility. And for the industry, as the industry is sort of crowded into the cores of these plays, not only are they interfering with themselves but they're potentially interfering with offset operators.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. No. That's helpful as well. So, appreciate it. Thanks.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, David.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tim Rezvan from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy A. Rezvan - Sterne Agee CRT
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, and I appreciate the color on the Bakken development. I think my questions there have been answered. So I guess â a question, you have a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet. I know there's a maturity coming. A lot of your longer-dated debt is trading at a steep discount. Just curious, I guess, Richard, how you all are thinking about maybe kind of accretively delevering.
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey, Tim, thanks. I mean in terms of where we're using our cash or how we're using our cash, we're looking at everything from open market repurchases of bonds to our capital program to acquisitions. And so I think nothing's off the table, but your observation of an accretive way to delever is, it's certainly out there, and we're looking at it.
Timothy A. Rezvan - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay, okay. And then I guess on the 2016 kind of oil guidance you gave I understand there's some complexities in the Bakken with the timing of bringing pads on, but how should we think about kind of the cadence of oil over the year. I mean we're two thirds of the way through the first quarter. So you have to have line of sight on that. Is it kind of a linear growth, or do you expect kind of a more back-end loaded as you work through (34:28). Any color on that would be helpful.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think for purposes of your modeling I would assume it's flattish. And we're going to be as I've already belabored and I'll belabor it again we're introducing more volatility as we sort of shut in, in some instances some pretty big wells for offset fracs. We've had instances where we've had to shut in wells that are making 15,000 barrels a day plus, and they've been offline for a couple of weeks or more while we frac and offset cluster of wells. So that's going to continue. And so I think just for your purposes for modeling oil production, you have to think about it sort of flattish across the year.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Silverstein from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Yeah. I guess, I'll transition to South, and just talk a bit about the Permian. I know the Bakken has certainly been the focus, but just wanted to see how the one rig program will look down there this year. Is it still kind of a delineation year or are you moving towards more wells per unit? How does that kind of stand for this year?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Josh. The focus is on development in the Spraberry. So, our capital is going to be allocated to drilling pad wells at six-day wells per spacing unit, per reservoir in the Spraberry. That's the best stuff that we have from an economic perspective. We may jump out and drill one delineation well from time-to-time, but the real focus is on just grinding out development wells and focusing on continuing to optimize the completion design at some of the most recent well results that we reported in the release. We continue to tweak the completion design and optimize not only proppant loading, but the type of fluids, in fact, fluids that we're using as well.
Josh I. Silverstein - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, just on portfolio management. I know this has been something of a fluid discussion for you guys. So, I guess, first just on the â just how you guys kind of view the three gas assets within the portfolio. Clearly, they've been deemphasized given the Permian and the Bakken development. And it looks like you guys added a lot of gas protection in 2017 on the hedge front thinking â I guess, maybe, the read is that maybe you think there's a bit more risk on gas volumes there. So is that something you guys maybe looking to divest? And then conversely, it seemed like you're starting to gain some working interest in South Antelope and how that program will continue in 2016?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So on the gas assets, we look at them as a viable option for future capital investment, and from a return perspective, the advantage that the more liquids rich plays particularly the Uinta and Pinedale had compared to the Haynesville has significantly deteriorated as a result of the decline in NGL prices and the fact that there's no ethane margin and propane and butane prices have come in quite dramatically as well.
So the return advantage of those assets has dropped dramatically. On the flipside, the Haynesville well performance of some of the more recent wells in which we have very small working interest that have been drilled by outside operators, the long lateral 7,500-foot laterals and big frac jobs that have been pumped on those wells have substantially improved the Haynesville well performance and well economic as costs have come down too.
So that becomes a viable investment opportunity for us, even in the suppressed gas price environment, we find ourselves. The returns on those wells are competitive with Pinedale and Uinta now and they're also competitive with the oil projects in our inventory at current prices. So, right now, we like having the gas option. We haven't "exercised" that option yet from an investment opportunity set.
As far as divestitures, look, if somebody came in and gave us an offer that we thought was attractive based on the value of holding the asset in our portfolio, we would consider divesting of one or more of those assets. But in this environment where everybody is sort of being forced to sell stuff, I'm not sure it's the right time. We do, however, have some other non-core assets that we're continuing to market. It's relatively small stuff, but it will help put additional cash on the balance sheet, so that we can continue to be opportunistic.
And just segueing to the second part of your question, we did pick up some interest in the Williston Basin last year. It was, basically, non-op interest in wells that the QEP operates mostly in South Antelope, some on the Fort Berthold reservation. And we're continuing to look at opportunities to do that, either buying out our partners or looking at bolting on adjacent acreage. So that process with our A&D team and asset managers continues.

Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Hey, Chuck, what's your plans about potentially looking at â you definitely have an above-average financial position as you pointed out your thoughts about looking at additional assets outside your plays that you have today?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Neal, given the current environment, obviously, our first foremost focus is on trying to bolt on to our existing asset base, and as I said, we've seen opportunities to do that. We've acted on some. We acted on a couple of opportunities to buy out partners in the Permian as well. It was partners that owned interest in acreage and wells in which we are already drilling and producing. So we continue to focus first there. Stepping out right now in this environment into a totally new basin, I won't say never but I would say it's not our focus.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Got it. And then just lastly, you mentioned about potential cost coming down. You talked about personnel and some other things, just your thoughts about oil service costs, some others, when you look the remainder of this year, how much improvement more do you see on that side? Thank you.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, Torgerson is sitting right next to me. If I said 50%, he'd probably reach over and smack me. And he's bigger than I am. So I won't say 50%. No. Look, I think that we have â there are opportunities to continue to squeeze out some cost. Is it 10%, 15%? It's going to vary by area, right.
So the areas where we've been operating for a very long time, and where we have a very strong focus on each individual component or well cost, and we've been continue to drive out unnecessary costs and really work collaborative â I will say collaboratively with our service providers to try to find additional cost savings. Those areas are going to be tough â I think about places like Pinedale, are going to be tough to squeeze out a huge amount of additional savings.
In other areas, like the Permian where, I would say, we're still in a, I don't know, fourth or fifth inning of evolution of our efficiency and cost savings, there's probably more opportunity. But we're thinking about 10% to 15% across the portfolio of additional savings, and that would be to a completed well. So that would include some additional efficiency gains as well as cost savings from concessions, from suppliers of services and materials.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. Please proceed with your question.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Good morning, guys, and I appreciate the time.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, David.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
As I was thinking about your business, two different questions, one on the operation side, then one more maybe for Richard around the bond repurchase comments. But the Permian Basin business, call it, 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day and operating margins of peers, does it generate about $25-ish million of cash flow in the fourth quarter, is that about it?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The Permian?
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Do you have any detail?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's probably less than that, David. I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, but less than $20 million, little less than $20 million, I would say.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Okay. So, as you think about that business, is it core business relative to how the Permian companies trade and you say you didn't want to do asset sales but just seems like the pure plays get up to 20 times multiples on that relative as things grow on an annual basis that could be an even more valuable asset. Is that something that's worth more to someone else than it is to QEP?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's a great question and not something we haven't discussed internally. It is an area that we think we have opportunity to drive future growth and future cash flow from, David. So the wrestling of the recognition of the future value of the asset, from multiple target horizons and the ability to drive cash flow in the future environment versus the obvious, and you stated I think quite well, arbitrage of that the market value of the asset versus the cash generative ability today. And it's a great question, it's a one that we, as I said, talked about internally quite a bit.
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hey, David. It's Richard. In your cash flow question, it's between $20 million and $25 million a quarter for the second half of last year.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Perfect.
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And then the second question, Richard, was on the bond repurchase.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Yeah, just kind of thinking about the drilling in to the return on the bonds and you guys really â it sounds like you're thinking about things the same way of how do you create the most value and about the bond repurchase comment it was pretty accurate of just use of cash into that. Do you have any restricted payment basket or anything that limits, like what would be the governors on buying in the bonds that seem to be trading at pretty big discount?
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. David, I'll make a couple of comments. One, Jim and I arm wrestle over how much cash he wants to use to drill his wells and how much cash I'd want to use to buy back bonds because the rate of returns are about the same, it's $0.60 to $0.70 on the dollar for the longer-dated notes. So that's â clearly we look at what the rate of return is on all our investments, whether it's bond repurchases or putting holes on the ground.
In terms of restrictions, there are no restrictions in the indentures or the credit agreement about the things we buy back or even dividends for that matter. So we don't really have a restriction obviously. You got creeping tender rules you have to be mindful of if you're making up with market purchases, but in terms of the return criteria we have, we're looking at all that deployment and cash in the same way.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brad Carpenter from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.
Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Hey. Good morning, guys. Chuck, or maybe this one is for Richard, can you provide some additional details behind the decision to terminate the contracts between QEP Marketing and QEP Energy? Was it merely an effort to streamline or simplify financials, or is there any other economic or other reasons behind that?
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
No. It was all â sorry. It's Richard. It was all trying to streamline the processes. And we inherited â when we were a subsidiary of Questar Corporation, we inherited a lot of structural things that made sense when we were part of a utility holding company that when we became freestanding E&P company didn't make sense. And so that collapse is just trying to streamline the business processes and make things easier for us and for our counterparties. So there's nothing else besides that.
Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. Great. And then as Neal and a few others have pointed out, you guys are in a relative position of strength compared to your peers. But if we're in a low $30 world throughout 2016, how do you think about activity levels in 2017? Are there specific toggles that you'll be focused on, whether it be avoiding any internal leverage dealing, or will you simply seek to match cash flow with your spend?
Charles B. Stanley - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I wish I had a crystal ball because as I said in my prepared remarks, it's an inexact science trying to match capital investment programs with forecasted cash flow. It's easy to forecast the CapEx. It's impossible, given the volatility, to accurately forecast cash flow, although we've hedged out, especially on the gas side, a lot of the volatility.
And we've got a decent hedge book for 2016 on the oil side. We've continued to layer on some hedges in 2017 to protect against the downside. But obviously if we see a protracted $30 environment, we'll relook at our capital investment programs, potentially deferring some of our completion activity into the end of the year and into 2017 to try to push some of the cash flow into 2017.
I look around at some of the folks who would rather be drilling wells and completing them and producing them, and they seem to be spending an inordinate amount of time running and rerunning models, and it's very frustrating, but it is part of what we have to do to work our way through this. I think that the mantra is, using Richard's canteen analogy, be very frugal in drinking from our canteen which is our balance sheet, maximizing the flexibility we have to keep all options open as we work through the year and as we watch the commodity price tape.
Brad Carpenter - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And congrats on a good quarter.

Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Michael Rowe from TPH. Please proceed with your question.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the financial covenants in your credit agreement. I certainly understand that there's an undrawn facility, and you probably don't need to draw it this year given your cash on hand. But given the debt to EBITDA covenants, as well as the proved reserves to funded debt covenants, can you just talk about kind of how you plan on managing through those this year?
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Michael, it's Richard. So, in the revolving credit facility, we have now three financial covenants that are in play. We've got a 60% debt to cap, and that's really not going to be a meaningful covenant for us for the foreseeable future. We were at 35% at year-end. We have a leverage cap that was reset for 2016 and 2017 at 4.25 times trailing 12 months EBITDA. And at the end of the year, we would be able to draw the full $1.8 billion of availability under the revolver.
And so, as you work through, as the EBITDA from 2015 rolls up and replace with 2016, we get to a point at the end of the year where we have some diminished availability in the revolver just by that 4.25-times cap. But still we think with the cash we have on hand and what that cushion looks like, we've got plenty of liquidity, call it, $0.25 billion to $0.5 billion by year-end 2016.
With regards to the third covenant that was triggered with the Moody's three notch downgrade, but the S&P affirmation, we have PV-9 cover test now that is again was amended to 1.25 times cover test.
We get to add the value of our derivatives, and all these are net debt test. And we're still working through that. We've got 75 days to deliver a reserve report that calculates what the PV-9 is. But our guess is we'll have close to $1 billion and $1.5 billion somewhere in that range of availability once that test â we begin to report compliant with that test.
So, for 2016, we don't really foresee any issues with regard to liquidity and being hamstrung by the covenants in the revolver to the extent that we make an acquisition, we get to pro forma that EBITDA into the trailing 12 months calculation, and the same thing if we have a meaningful divestiture, and we have to subtract that EBITDA. So, yeah, short answer is we feel pretty good about the amount of liquidity we have available under the covenants and revolver.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
That's very helpful. Thanks. And just last question would be just on bolt-ons and how you all would consider funding those. You talked spending nearly $100 million in 2015, mostly in the Williston. To the extent you saw some more opportunities, just small working interest purchases here and there to consolidate your position, could you just talk about how you would kind of fund those short term and potentially long term as well? Thanks.
Richard J. Doleshek - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And Michael, that's the continued discussion about the balance sheet and what we're going to use that cash for, and the tension between open market repurchase of bonds, capital spending and acquisitions because we do think that there will be lots of opportunities this year for us to continue to add to our core areas. So with things like the $100 million of acquisitions last year, we just funded that out cash on the balance. And whether it's, as Chuck alluded to, to continue non-core asset sales that will kind of trickle out through the year, using the cash on the balance sheet, that's kind of what we're trying to balance those three uses of cash.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
