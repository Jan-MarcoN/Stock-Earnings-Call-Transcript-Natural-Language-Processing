That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at sandisk.com/ir. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance will also be posted on our website. This guidance is exclusive of any one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after January 21, 2015.
In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other future events. Please refer to todayâs press release and our SEC filings, including the most recent 10-Q, for more information on the risk factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of today.
Before I turn the call over to Sanjay, Iâd like to inform you that our first quarter earnings conference call is being planned for April 15. We are also planning to host our 2015 Investor Day meeting on May 13 in Milpitas California. Please mark your calendars.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. 2014 was a record year for revenue and non-GAAP earnings and our business generated strong cash flows. We are pleased to have returned more than 100% of our 2014 free cash flow to our investors through our capital return program. We successfully drove our portfolio make shift towards high value solutions during the year with total SSD revenue contributing 29% of 2014 revenue up from 19% of 2013 revenue.
Moving to the details of the business we are disappointed with our fourth quarter execution. As we indicated in the October conference call, our inventory levels were extremely lean exiting the third quarter and were anticipated to become even leaner throughout the fourth quarter. We over estimated our ability to service our customers demand variability with our low levels of inventory creating supply short falls in certain products.
Additionally, within the fourth quarter unplanned maintenance activities in our Yokkaichi fab operations as well as lower yield on certain memory dye [ph] led to unexpected reduction in production output. The combination of lean inventory and reduced memory output made our ability to meet our customer demand even more challenging during the seasonally strong period.
These factors impacted our business most notably in our retail and iNAND product lines. Within retail, the late timing of supply availability resulted in large sales opportunities. Within iNAND demand for our previous generation product fell more rapidly than forecasted by our customers, while we had limited ability to service demands for our newer products due to supply constraints. We are taking corrective measures to mitigate the recurrence of these events in the future to ensure that we can consistently meet our customersâ expectations. It is clear that one of our top operational priorities for 2015 is to rebuild our inventory levels which we expect to be restored to normal levels by midyear.
In embedded, in the second half of 2014 we estimate that the smartphone market consumed more embedded flash based on X3 NAND technology than ever before, and we are leading the industry and advancing the usage of X3 in embedded products with our seventh generation X3 technologies. Over the course of this year with our strong roadmap we expect to win designs for our embedded X3 Solutions at multiple OEM customers with strong production ramp in the second half of 2015.
Beyond the smartphone and tablet markets, we are pleased with the traction we are seeing for our embedded and removable solution with customers in the connected home, automotive and content delivery markets. 
Turning to enterprise SSDs, revenue grew on both the sequential and the year-over-year basis during the fourth quarter, this full year revenue nearly doubling on a year-over-year basis. The fourth quarter enterprise SSD revenue was driven by continuing strength in the fas SSDs and the significant increase in revenue from sales of CloudSpeed enterprise SATA products to hyperscale customers. We have largely completed our overall Fusion-io integration and we are excited about the opportunities ahead with the broadest portfolio of enterprise SSD products in the industry.
We made solid progress in moving the Fusion-io go-to-market strategy to an OEM centric model and enhancing sales force productivity. We continue to expect that our enterprise solutions revenue will achieve $1 billion in 2015. Our client SSDs completed a very strong year in 2014 with 36% year-over-year growth with strong penetration in both OEM and retail markets. Retail existence of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSD continues to be solid. With our OEM customers we expanded our presence further with our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs.
Corporate adoption of our client SSDs continues to accelerate, driven by an increasing attach rate of SSD in notebooks. I am pleased to note that qualification for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs is nearing completion with multiple OEM customers. One headwind for our client SSDs however is that a major customer had decided to move away from our client SSD solution starting in Q1. Taking this into consideration, we estimate our 2015 total SSD sales enterprise and client solutions combined as a percentage of revenue to remain similar to the 29% revenue mix in 2014.
We expect that mix to be driven by significantly higher sales in enterprise, partially offset by a decline in client SSD sales. Driven by market growth and continued share gain and corporate PC platforms, we anticipate that our client SSD revenue will grow again starting in 2016.
In retail we do not see any material changes to the demand in the market place although there could be pockets of demand weakness in certain regions like EMEA due to macroeconomic factors. We expect our retail channel eventually have the number one flash NAND in the world to continue to be a solid contributor to our overall business and profitability in 2015.
In manufacturing, the output from our wafers fabs was below our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year for the reasons I described earlier with the full years bit supply growth in 2014 increasing by 20% from 2013 at the low end of our original 20% to 30% growth range estimate.
The primary driver of the low bit growth was the high mix of 19-nanometer wafers in order to service our OEM customers. The ramp of our 15-nanometer technology is proceeding well, with cost crossover that 1Y technology achieved late in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect a strong production ramp of 15-nanometer throughout 2015 with the mix reaching 50% of our sales in the second half of the year.
We are now utilizing 15-nanometer X3 technology in retail products and in the first quarter of 2015 we will begin sampling the new technology in embedded applications. Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress and we remain on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015 with volume production targeted in 2016. We remain confident that our 3D NAND Memory products in production in 2016 will be competitive that those offered by others in the market at that time.
From a NAND industry standpoint, our estimate for 2015 supply bit growth is in the range of 35% to 40% and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply demand environment. As we have previously mentioned, we will be implementing a 5% expansion to our wafer capacity in the first half of 2015 and this will increase our captive wafer capacity to approximately 3 million wafers in the second half of the year. We expect that our wafer capacity expansion along with an increasing mix of 15-nanometer technology and an increasing mix of X3 will bring our captive supply bit growth for 2015 to the high end of the industry bit growth range.
To conclude, we have focussed on improving our supply and product availability and we will continue managing the business for profitable growth and strong cash flows. In 2105, while our revenue will be challenged in the first half of the year, we expect to return to solid growth in the second half of the year, driven by continuing share gains in enterprise storage and accelerating momentum in embedded solutions. We look forward to bringing greater value to a broader customer base with exciting new products and further extending our position as a pre eminent supplier of innovative storage solutions. We remain excited about the future profits of the company and plan to continue our strong capital return program.
With that I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook.
Judy Bruner
Thank you, Sanjay. For the full year 2014, we grew our revenue by 7% and our non-GAAP EPS by 5% including the dilutive impact of the Fusion-io acquisition. While these total results were quite strong, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter performance and our first half of 2015 will be focussed on recovering from the current headwinds in our supply and in our client SSD business. We expect that in the second half of 2015 we will return to year-over-year topline growth and delivering non-GAAP operating profit within our target financial model of 25% to 30% of revenue.
Iâll take you through some details of our Q4 results and then discuss 2015 expectations in more detail. Our Q4 revenue was approximately flat, both sequentially and year-over-year and was comprised of 69% commercial and 31% retail compared to the year ago quarter which was 62% commercial and 38% retail.
Our retail revenue was down 2% sequentially and down 18% year-over-year. Typically the fourth quarter has been the strongest quarter of the year for our retail revenue. While we expect that some year-over-year decline in Q4 retail revenue due to the contraction of the imaging market, we believe the market did grow sequentially while our revenue was constrained by our limited supply and low channel inventory levels.
In addition, there were some pockets of pricing weakness in EMEA and APAC. On a regional basis we generated sequential retail revenue growth in North America where we were better able to meet the timing requirements of customer demand and this was offset by a decline in revenue in Europe and APAC where our supply constraints were more pronounced. 
Our commercial revenue was flat sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Within our commercial revenue on a sequential basis our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly while our client SSD revenue was down modestly primarily due to seasonality and anticipated supply constraints. Our combined SSD revenue increased to 31% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter up from 27% in Q3. Our embedded revenue grew sequentially by 10% with the decline in revenue from iNAND solution and strong growth in custom embedded revenue.
As Sanjay described our iNAND revenue was below our original expectations due to a faster than anticipated decline in demand for our older generation products combined with supply constraints for our newer iNAND products. Finally, within our commercial revenue sales of wafers and compliance were down sequentially as we prioritize supply for value added solutions and our license and royalty revenue grew slightly on a sequential basis.
Turning to a few metrics for the fourth quarter, on a sequential basis our gigabytes sold increased 4% and ASP per gigabyte declined by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, our fourth quarter gigabyte sold increased to 32% and ASP per gigabyte declined 24%.
For the full year 2014 our revenue bit growth was 36% in comparison to the 20% supply bit growth that Sanjay described. This difference in bit growth left our inventory levels too lean and we are working to rebuild our inventory levels in the first half of 2015.
Turning to gross margin, for 2014 our blended ASP per gigabyte declined by 22% and our all in cost per gigabyte also declined by 22%. Our full year non-GAAP gross margin was 48% in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51% and up 70 basis points from 2013. In the fourth quarter our non-GAAP gross margin decreased sequentially from 49% to 45% below our previous forecast of 47% to 49%. There were three primary factors that contributed to the sequential decline in gross margin and the miss from our forecast.
First was the lower mix of retail revenue which carries a higher than average gross margin. The lower retail mix was driven primarily by supply constraints. Second, as Sanjay previously discussed, we experienced faster than expected demand reduction for certain end-of-life products which made available trailing edge technology node X2 NAND.
In an attempt to meet customer demand timing requirements we used this older node X2 NAND in products that would normally use more current node X3 NAND memory. This inefficient memory usage as well as the lower fab output put upward pressure on our memory cost. Third, we took inventory reserves related to a faster than expected decline in demand for certain end-of-life OEM products as well as for our ULLtraDIMM product which has become the subject of a core injunction stemming from litigation to which we are not a party. The yen rate in our fourth quarter cost of sale was 102.5 compared to 101 in Q3 which resulted in a small positive impact to gross margin.
Including all these factors our fourth quarter cost per gigabyte increased sequentially by 3% compared to the 4% decrease in ASP per gigabyte. Our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses decreased sequentially by $12 million driven by a reduction in restructuring expenses related primarily to Fusion-io integration activities.
Our non-GAAP operating margin was 24% in Q4 and 28% for the full year inclusive of Fusion-io related restructuring charges. Other income and expense was a net expense in Q4 due to charges related to the spin-out of the ioControl business now known as NexGen.
Our non-GAAP tax rate declined in the fourth quarter due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For the full year our non-GAAP tax rate was 30.9% and the GAAP tax rate was 32.3%. Our diluted share count came down on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis driven by strong share repurchases. In Q4 we spent approximately $500 million on the repurchase of over 5.5 million shares.
Q4 cash flow from operations was $488 million bringing full year cash flow from operations to $1.7 billion. Our fourth quarter free cash flow was $476 million including the net return of $55 million of cash from the flash venture. For 2014, our free cash flow was 1.5 billion and our capital return program totalled 103% of free cash flow. During the year, we paid 235 million in dividends and repurchased 14.3 million shares resulting in a net reduction in shares outstanding of 9.5 million shares.
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q4 was $209 million, and non-fab capital investments were $67 million, bringing 2014 gross capital investments to approximately $1.15 billion.
Our 2014 capital investments were funded primarily by flash venture working capital and secondarily by flash venture operating leases. Our cash outlay for capital investments in 2014 was $207 million or 18% of the gross investment.
Our inventory ended the year at $698 million, the lowest level in both dollars and weeks of supply since late 2011 when our products mix was very different and our revenue was much lower. The longest cycle time for SSDs coupled with the increased breadth of our product portfolio has led to a need for higher inventory weeks of supply where as we currently have the lowest weeks of supply since Q3 of 2011.
Turning to our expectations for 2015 we will be rebuilding our inventory buffers in order to meet the needs of our customers and accommodate normal variability in product demand. In order to restore our inventory health, we believe 2015 revenue bit growth can be no more than 30% inclusive of non captive inventory in comparison to our expected captive supply bit growth at the high end of the anticipated industry growth of 35% to 40%.
As Sanjay described, we expect our client SSD revenue to decline due to a large customer moving away from our solution. The key product areas where we expect revenue growth in 2015 are enterprise and embedded solutions. In total we expect our revenue to experience a year-on-year decline in both the first and second quarters and return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2015.
Our first quarter revenue forecast is $1,400 million to $1,450 million. And our 2015 revenue forecast is $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. In terms of gross margin, the first quarter will continue to be impacted by using an inefficient memory mix as well as some extra non captive memory. We will also start to incur some start up cost in cost of sales related to our Malaysia assembly and test factory which will begin production in the middle of the year.
These factors plus the sequentially lower revenue level will put pressure on gross margins. Offsetting these factors will be a more favourable yen rate of approximately 108 in our Q1 cost of sales based primarily on Q4 purchase rates and previous hedges. In total, we expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be similar to that of the fourth quarter or approximately 45%.
We expect gross margins to improve across the second through the fourth quarter based on improving inventory levels, product transitions to 1Y and 1Z, a higher usage of X3 memory, increasing enterprise revenue mix and a more favourable yen rate assuming the yen to dollar exchange rate stays at current level.
We expect that the gross margin improvement will be more concentrated in the second half of the year. We forecast our full year 2015 non-GAAP gross margin to be 47% to 48% in the middle of our target financial model of 45% to 51% with Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP gross margin in the upper half of our model.
We expect non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter to be between $365 million and $375 million and for the full year we expect our non-GAAP expenses to be approximately $1.5 billion. This is somewhat higher than our target financial model of 20% to 21% of revenue as we continue to make key investments.
In terms of non-GAAP operating margin we expect to be solidly in our 25% to 30% target financial model in the second half of the year. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income and expense is approximately $15 million of income for the year and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain about the same at 31%.
Our 2015 capital investment is estimated at approximately $1.4 billion including a 5% capacity add and the addition of a 3D NAND pilot line. We expect cash usage to be between $300 million and $400 million for these capital investments with the remainder funded by flash venture of working capital and leases. We will manage our business with a focus on achieving our target financial model for free cash flow of 15% of revenue. And we will continue a strong share repurchase program which should lead to diluted shares coming down again in 2015.
In summary, we expect to strengthen the business across 2015 with inventory rebuilding in the first half of 2015 and strong roadmaps and customer relationships in place, we look forward to a strong second half of the year.
We expect full year 2015 revenue to be similar to slightly higher than in 2014 driven by growth and enterprise and embedded solutions revenue. We expect to deliver healthy profit margins and be solidly within our target financial model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the second half of the year. We intend to spend at least 100% of our 2015 free cash flow on our capital return program this year.
We will now take your questions.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Tanisha, can you poll floor for questions please, and if I can ask the callers to ask one and a brief follow-up.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Q - Joe Moore
Great. Thank you. I wondered if you could start with the lost SSD win that you would had. Can you just kind of walk us through, is it was there reason that you lost that and then whatâs the profit impact from that? My sense was that SSD from a gross margin basis wasnât that much different than the rest of the business. But can you just talk specifically to that impact?
Sanjay Mehrotra
I will start with this and then Judy will comment on the gross margin aspect. So, we of course cannot comment on the business decisions by our customer. But what I will tell you is that SanDisk roadmap of our SSD solutions is very strong, very solid and actually SanDisk continues to gain substantial momentum across the broad range of client [ph] PC platforms.
When you look at corporate PC demand, you know, weâre getting strong design win. Of course this particular loss of business â customer with respect to them moving away from our SSD solution, we had a large share, so this impacts our revenue in 2015 timeframe. But we are continuing to have strong momentum with corporate PC platform sales.
Judy Bruner
And Joe, in terms of gross margin impact you know weâve said before that client SSD business tends to have a gross margin thatâs less than the corporate average. And so, by client SSD business shrinking, you could say that that has some positive impact on the blended gross margin. However, at the same time I expect that embedded mix in our business is going to increase and that also tends to have a less than corporate average gross margin.
So I view the change in mix between client SSD and embedded to be roughly a wash in terms of mix effect on the year. The key mix effect as we move across 2015 is going to be the increasing mix of enterprise which will have a positive effect on gross margins.
Joe Moore
Okay.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Joe, did you have follow-up?
Operator
Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Sanjay, I guess Iâm just trying to better understand sort of inherently your mix strategy, because all throughout 2014 you made strides in mixing up the business as you talked about and yet if I look at fourth quarter earnings year-over-year, they are down about 20%. So Iâm just trying to get a sense of what is the mix strategy and are you still holding to your target of enterprise SSD being over a $1 billion for the fiscal year 2015?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Absolutely, we are holding on to our strategy. I believe our strategy is very sound and working well for us. Continuing to focus on increasing the mix of high value solutions and as part of that as I mentioned in my remarks, enterprise SSD solution they will certainly achieve a $1 billion for us in 2015 for our revenue and weâll continue to grow in that space in the future as well.
We have previously articulated our goal to be a number one market share leader, market shareholder in enterprise SSDs in the future and we are absolutely well on our way in that regard.
John Pitzer
Perfect.
Judy Bruner
Yes. I might justâ¦
John Pitzer
Yes, Iâm sorry.
Judy Bruner
I might just add that in terms of the mix effect of our business. Absolutely the enterprise mix is increasing and that has positive impact on margins. But if you think about it on a year-over-year basis the retail mix has come down some and that has some offsetting effect as we have mentioned several times. But as we move through 2015 we really believe that our gross margin is going to accelerate across the year and we believe as I said that weâll be in the upper half of our target financial model in the second half of 2015.
John Pitzer
And then as a follow-on on Joeâs question, the client SSD OEM customer that you lost, I know you wonât mention them by name, but is that the same customer that you maintain 19 nanometer capacity for â and if it is doesnât that kind of go to whether or not you guys will be more aggressive driving mix towards whatâs optimal for your company more so than whatâs optimal for your customers?
Sanjay Mehrotra
In terms of 19-nanometer capacity, as we mentioned some of that was in our iNAND business for some of the customer forecast that were there. And those customer forecast for those 19-nanometer iNAND product dropped as the customer itself was going through certain transitions of their platforms. And that resulted in some of the details that Judy described earlier in her remarks as well as resulted in iNAND shortfall in revenue in the fourth quarter.
Of course, weâve also use 19-nanometer production primarily for our enterprise products, enterprise solutions and enterprise customers tend to stay on prior generation nodes for longer period of time.
And as our enterprise business grew during the course of the year thatâs what made us bring in more 19-nanometer supply during 2015 to meet the requirements of some of our OEM customers. And that resulted in some of the bit growth being 20% versus the prior [ph] expectations that Iâd mentioned earlier as well.
So overall, we of course continue to work on transitioning our customers to the new technology nodes, but older technology nodes are required to be held for OEM parts of the business. In this particular case it was more iNAND and enterprise solutions that I mentioned.
John Pitzer
Thank you, guys.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, John. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini
Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Sanjay, when we look at the $1 billion target for enterprise SSD, how should we think about the Fusion-io contribution? And what would it be if you didnât have constrained with shipping ULLtraDIMM products and I have a follow-up?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Regarding ULLtraDIMM itself our expectations in 2015 are fairly small as you know in terms of revenue, as you know itâs a very new product category and continuing to engage with the customer base. But clearly ULLtraDIMM product category as we mentioned does get impacted by the injunction that we currently have. And that injunction would have to be lifted soon. I mean, the legal matter would have to be dissolve soon in order for ULLtraDIMM momentum to begin again, otherwise the sales of ULLtraDIMM would get impacted.
Regarding the fusion-io part of the business, as we had expected before, the fusion-io part of the business is not at the run rate that it was pre-acquisition and therefore we expected during the time of the acquisition as well. However we have made a strong progress in terms of integration. We have an excellent team, strong roadmap for fusion-io product. And we expect in Q1 to have sequential growth in that part of the business.
And certainly as part of our $1 billion goal in 2015 for enterprise SSD solutions, fusion-io revenue will be a significant contributor there as well. You will recall that $1 billion goal at our last May Investor Day was actually our 2016 goal and we pulled it in to 2015 once we acquired fusion-io, because now we have a broad base of enterprise storage solution as a broadest portfolio in the industry between fab, SATA, PCIe getting complemented now by our software capabilities and leading to some exciting solutions possibilities. So really of these on our enterprise business positioning us in a unique and differentiated position leading to $1 billion goal for the year for us in enterprise.
Mehdi Hosseini
And then follow-up for Judy, how we should we think about the cost down through ramping the 1Z on 15-nanometer versus the impact of currency especially as we look into Q2 and Q3 assuming that the yen were to stay at the current level?
Judy Bruner
Sure. We expect that our costs down on per gigabyte basis in 2015 will be in that 15% to 25% range that weâve talked about many times. It was 22% as I said for 2014. And if you think about the key factors in 2015 will definitely get good costs down from 1Z as well as from an increasing usage of X3 memory across the year.
And then, we of course will also have mix effects as the enterprise portion or for mix of our business growth that will tempt to dampen the cost reduction across the year. So thatâs built into our expectation. And yes, it is our current expectation that weâll get a benefit from the yen and thatâs in there as well.
Mehdi Hosseini
Thank you.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Mehdi. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Freedman with RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Doug Freedman
Hi, Judy and Sanjay. Thanks for taking by question. If I look at your full year guidance, Iâm a little confused. It looks like at the midpoints weâre looking about 2% revenue growth. But yet youâre talking about close to 30% bit growth shipments. That would imply about 28% ASP erosion. Thatâs seems a bit high to me especially given the commentary that you should be seeing your bit selling for a high mix shift. So if you could walk me through a little bit how weâre getting to the revenue guidance and the bit growth in. I know you donât talk about ASPs, but if you could maybe back into the mix that you expect to be driven that it would be helpful?
Judy Bruner
Sure. So, youâre right. We donât talk about specific ASP assumptions, but I think if you do the math with a bit growth, the revenue bit growth of say, 30%, you can easily get to some type of blended overall price decline similar to 2014. And 2014 we believe was in healthy balance overall for the year.
2014 also had mix effect on our blended pricing and 2015 will also have mix effect on our pricing. I was just talking relative to cost about the growth in the enterprise mix of our business and as the enterprise mix of our business grows that will tend to dampen the blended price decline. But at the same time as the mix of our business shift from to be less client SSD and more embedded that mix shift will put some acceleration on that blended price decline statistic.
It doesnât necessarily change the gross margin, but client SSDs tend to sell at a higher price per gigabyte than do the embedded solutions. So thereâs a lot of mix effects in our assumption, but we believe that the â our outlook at this point is for a very healthy industry environment in 2015 and thatâs assumed in our revenue forecast.
Doug Freedman
Okay. I still have some more questions on this, but Iâll ask them after the call around fall back. If I could maybe get a little bit of color on your expectations for the custom embedded segment of your business and maybe what percentage of mix youâre expecting there verse in 2016 versus 2015? And thanks again for taking my questions.
Judy Bruner
Well, we really donât breakout the embedded portion of our mix, but we expect that we will see growth and very good growth in embedded in 2015, and I expect that we will see growth in various parts of our embedded revenue. You asked about 2016 and 2015, but I think you were probably referring to 2015 and 2014.
Operator
Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you. I had two questions, first of all, youâve been very clear on this year basically it sounds like youâre increasing captive bit supply just a little bit from the middle of 30 to 40 range to the high end of the range. My question is on 2016, because at Analyst Day you gave the same sort of up 30 to 40 number for the industry for 2016, which you said, youâd back to sort of under growing at say, up 25 to 35, but now since youâre actually picking up a bit more captive bit growth this year and inventory, it should be normalize this year. Are you similarly going to grow your captive bit supply faster in 2016? Thanks.
Judy Bruner
Yes. Weâre not really prepared to give a specific captive supply bit growth percentage yet for 2016. But I will tell you that with hindsight we wish we would have grown our captive supply bit growth somewhat more in 2014 and so weâll clearly take that into account as we look at our plans for 2016. But we remain very prudent in terms of our capacity growth and our supply planning. That is not changing. Thatâs a main stay of how we run our business.
Timothy Arcuri
Got it, Judy. Thanks so much. And then just â I had a question on inventories. If I calculate it right, it looks like it came down about week and a half on a petabyte basis? And you said before I think you want to be in the 10-week range something like that. Are you going to be able to get to 10 weeks exiting Q1 or is it more should we think about it you going to â you sort of exit midyear in that range?
Judy Bruner
We exited 2014 at about 8 weeks of inventory. And you are right; I have said in the past that we need to be at least to 10 weeks. In fact the right range I believe is 10 to 12 weeks. By the way I used to talk a number of years ago about the right range for inventory being 10 to 12 weeks. And since that time the complexity of the mix of our business and the cycle time as we have grown the SSDs has increased.
At the same time weâve made efficiency gains in our processes and so when you net those two together I still believe that 10 to 12 weeks is the right range for our inventory to best manage our business. I donât expect that we will be there at the end of Q1. I really believe it will take until the middle of the year for us to get to the low end of that range.
Timothy Arcuri

Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Sterne Agee.
Vijay Rakesh
Hi, guys. Just going back to the yen you said 108 [ph] for the March quarter, whatâs your yen hedging for Q2, Q3 or have you hedged that far out?
Judy Bruner
We have not placed any hedges for 2015 for our yen wafer purchases. It is â we monitor this consistently and it may â there may come a day where we decide that weâre going to place some hedges, but to-date we have not placed any hedges for 2015 wafer purchases.
Vijay Rakesh
Got it. So, going back to the enterprise SSD side, you said that mostly 19-nanometer on enterprise today. When does that move to 15-nanometer in enterprise? Thatâs it. Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Toward the end of this year is when we plan to start shipping in enterprise SSD our next generation memory technology nodes.
Vijay Rakesh
Thank you.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Vijay. Next question please.

Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis
Thanks for taking the question. Sanjay, looking beyond the near term issue with the large customer on the consumer SSD side of the business, can you talk about things that you see from a program standpoint to a product standpoint that give you the confidence that that business can get back to growth and when would it be expected to get back to year-on-year growth?
Sanjay Mehrotra
In terms of the consumer SSD business?
Craig Ellis
Thatâs right.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes. So, consumer SSD business actually in terms of corporate PC platforms with vast majority â almost all of the ecosystem of customers that is there for those platforms, we are gaining share except for this large customer where we mentioned the situation in our prepared remarks. So we are making very good progress. We have excellent roadmap there. And we throughout the course of the year we plan to be gaining share in that particular part of the business. And 2016 is where I would expect on a year-over-year basis client SSD business to return to revenue growth.
Craig Ellis
Thank you. And then the follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
But in terms of other customers weâll be increasing our client SSD sales all throughout 2015 as well.
Craig Ellis
Okay. And then the follow-up is different subject. You noted that the fusion-io integration is essentially complete. The board also authorized very nice $2.5 billion buyback reload. With the announcement on the buyback are you saying that youâre really not focused on M&A and growth through acquisition as we look at 2015 or would that be incorrect conclusion?
Sanjay Mehrotra
You know, we do not really comment on or speculate on mergers and acquisition. I mean, we are very excited about our position in enterprise SSD solutions space and we of course always keep track of what is going on elsewhere in the industry. We donât rule out anything. However we donât speculate on it either.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Craig. Next question please.

Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
CJ Muse
Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, I donât want to beat a dead horse here, but curious on the client SSD side, was that a function of bit availability, your price or what kind of further clarity can you provide there?
Sanjay Mehrotra
You know, we are not going to comment on business decisions by our customer given the confidentiality required here. But would again point out that our roadmap of client SSD solutions continues to be very solid, our engagement in client SSD is broadening with our customers very excited about corporate PC platform, as I mentioned earlier.
And as you know that the attach rate of flash in PC platform is continuing to increase very nicely, particularly in corporate PC platform last year the attach rate of flash to corporate PC was about 40% and this year it suppose to be more than 50% and expected to reach about 80%, 85% by 2018 or so timeframe.
So itâs a huge opportunity for flash attach rate in corporate PC platforms. We are well positioned with our roadmap and absolutely continuing to drive this opportunity ahead across the broad range of customers.
CJ Muse
Helpful. And I guess this is follow-up. In terms of your revenue guide at the high end of the range and I just going back to Dougâs question, can you comment at all on what is imply there in terms of I guess mix as you talked about as well as like-for-like pricing declines and within that construct how you think about supply, demand for NAND for the entire year?
Judy Bruner
Yes. As I said before we believe that supply/demand is in a healthy balance for 2015 for the industry in terms of our own mix within that revenue. We expect that our total SSD mix will stay about the same on a year-on-year basis as the client SSD mix comes down, but the enterprise SSD mix goes up. And then we expect that embedded is going to grow and that it will gain in terms of mix relative most likely to retail. Retail in terms of overall market is relatively flattish and so overtime that will tend to come down as a percentage of our revenue.
CJ Muse
If I could just ask one quick follow-up, you talked about cost down on the 15% to 25% range, but the implied ASP decline and your revenue guidance is down 28%. So, are we supposed to think that a healthy supply/demand environment has that kind of annual ASP degradation thatâs over and above your cost down efforts?
Judy Bruner
No. Again as I said earlier I think if you do the math you can come to a pricing environment or decline that is similar in 2015 to 2014. And again there is a lot of mix effects that go into that price. Its not just like-for-like, but our expectation is that the industry will be in a healthy environment and that our gross margins will be increasing across the year.
CJ Muse
Thank you.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, CJ. Next question please.

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney
Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to follow-up more on Fusion-io you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the integration there was largely complete. Can you talk about how accretive Fusion-io is today and then some of the drivers that you have to improve the accretion for Fusion going forward and when we can expect to see those?
Judy Bruner
I would tell you that the Fusion-io acquisition is not accretive yet as we had expected and we continue to expect that it will be accretive in the second half of 2015 which is what we actually said at the time we announce the acquisition.
Mark Delaney
Okay. And then, I think also in the prepared remarks you talk about some yield issues in the fourth quarter, have those now been completely resolved?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes. Those yield issues have been resolved and our yields on both our 1Y and 1Z technologies, second generation 19-nanometer and 15-nanometer technology theyâre all on track, -- my expectation of the business.
Mark Delaney
Thank you.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Mark. Next question please.

Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.
Gabriel Ho
Hi. This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow-up on the SSD and the embedded margins, because you mentioned that you expect the client SSD to decline while your embedded increase and net-to-net itâs going to be â gross margin to be similar. And does it imply to my understanding, correct me if Iâm wrong, your embedded SSD and your embedded and client SSD margin to be similar at this point or am I missing something?
Judy Bruner
Yes. Weâve said in the past that those gross margins are relatively similar and that the gross margins for embedded and client SSD are below our corporate average. The gross margins for enterprise and retail are above our corporate average.
Gabriel Ho
So as a follow-up, can you help us understand the dynamics of these SSD pricing, I think looks like the decline â the price decline accelerating in 2014 and going forward do you think the client SSD to be headwind margins in the longer term?
Judy Bruner
Well, we expect client SSD business to grow in the longer term, but we also expect enterprise to grow and in fact we expect enterprise to grow faster than client SSD. So, maybe most to that would be a positive for gross margins.
Gabriel Ho
Okay. Thanks.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Gabriel. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Newman with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mark Newman
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. You talked about some yield issues and fab operation issues early on the call. Is there any more guidance you can talk about what exactly happened? And is this is just normal issues or is that shrink from 19 to 15 getting increasingly complex that is making something different. Iâm just trying to get a sense if there is something special that happens because you did mention a few times about a supply constraint and Iâm trying to understand why specifically that happened?
And then related to that, if you have supply constraints, can you explain why weâre not seeing stronger ASPs or should we expect that later, because if you would have supply constraint you would assume that you would have more negotiating leverage and that would have upsize on pricing negotiations, and its just a timing thing that we should expect that later or why weâre not seeing the ASP upside from the supply constraint?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Mark regarding the yield question that you asked in terms of the yields, low yields that we experienced during the fourth quarter which as I mentioned earlier are now back on track. There was really nothing that unusual about it, you know such kind of yield excursions from may can occur in the fas in any technology node so nothing out of extraordinary there. We have ofcourse adjusted, point to note though is that then those kind of yield excursions happen in the face of very lean inventories where the business was already running very tight in terms of from supply point of view meeting the customer expectations, then that kind of yield impact has a bigger than that kind of yield loss has a bigger impact on our serviceability to the customers. So that fortunately happened there. I mean the yield also was nothing that unusual, these kind of excursions with advanced technology nodes can occur from time to time. Normally we would have sufficient inventory levels to really be able to correct those and overcome those effects without really passing on any of that issue to the customer side or suffering from any mismatch in terms of demand and supply.
Regarding your second question, Iâm trying to remember what was the second question.
Judy Bruner
Iâll take it. You asked about pricing and what if we are in supply constraint, why are we experiencing any price decline? And I guess what I would point out to you is that overall we believe the industry is in good balance and in that good balance environment there is some level of price decline. We need to be competitive in the market place. I would tell you that I believe our absolute prices in almost every area are higher than the competition and because of the value of the products that we are selling and our price decline is modest. We had a 4% sequential price decline in the fourth quarter and that of course includes the impact of fourth quarter retail promotion. And you know you donât sell and retail especially in the fourth quarter without participating in those promotions even if you are in short supply. And thatâs the way the retail market works.
And so I really believe our pricing position is very good and our price decline is not in any way exaggerated infact our prices, and to really reflect the value of our products.
Mark Newman
And then on your buyback sides youâve got $3 billion now of buybacks. Should we expect, will then in 2015, have you given guidance on how much that would be this year and considering the share price has been weak recently are you going to be opportunistic on potentially front load that?
Judy Bruner
As I said in my prepared remarks we expect to spend at least a 100% free cash â 2015 free cash flow on capital return this year of which share repurchase is the biggest piece of that. And so we intend to have a strong share repurchase program and clearly we believe and our board believes in the prospects of the company and so we intend to utilize our plan in an aggressive way relative to our capital return program overtime.
Mark Newman
Thank you very much.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Mark. Tanisha, thatâs all the time unfortunately we have for the day. But before we end the call, Sanjay would like to make a comment. 
Sanjay Mehrotra
So I just wanted to say that our Q4 reserves and then near term outlook that we discussed in the call today is really nothing but a temporary setback. In the past SanDisk had setbacks that and SanDisk always emerged even stronger from those setback. I am confident that we shall do the same again this time. SanDisk has a solid strategy, we have excellent capabilities that are only strengthening further and our team is outstanding. And I look forward to a solid progress in our business over the course of the year resulting in substantial momentum in our business in the second half of 2015. And with that let me end by saying thank you and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Sanjay. Thank you, Judy. And thank you all for everyone. Thank you for joining us. A webcast replay of todayâs call should be available on our IR website shortly. Thanks again and have a good evening.
