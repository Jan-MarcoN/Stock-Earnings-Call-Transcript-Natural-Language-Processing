Presentation
 Operator
Welcome to the DuPont conference call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions]
Please note that the conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Greg Friedman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.
Greg Friedman
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us to cover DuPont's third-quarter 2014 performance.
Joining me are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; and Nick Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and CFO. The slides for today's presentation and corresponding segment commentary can be found on our website along with our news release.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide 1 for our disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, and involve a number of risks and assumptions.
We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and today's slides posted on our website.
For today's agenda, Nick will review our third-quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. I will provide business segment insights, and we'll conclude with Ellen's comments, followed by your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.
Nick Fanandakis
Thank you, Greg.
Starting with slide 2, you will see the highlights of our third quarter. We delivered $0.54 operating earnings-per-share versus $0.45 last year. That's 20% growth in a sluggish macroeconomic environment outside of North America, and significant year-over-year headwinds in agriculture.
Sales were down 3%, reflecting the impact of portfolio changes. Specifically, the sale of GLS/Vinyls, our Sontara and Stonetech businesses, along with the disposition of our aniline facility at Baytown, and the sale of our interest in a joint venture in Europe. All of these actions are aligned with our strategy to enhance the value creation of our portfolio.
Volume gains were largely offset by price reductions. Total segment operating earnings margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year, reflecting our ongoing efforts to enhance the value of our portfolio. In total, the results for the third quarter are in line with our previous announced expectations, and reflect solid performance among our businesses.
Let's turn now to slide 3, and I'll cover the results for our reporting segments. We entered the third quarter with headwinds in agriculture, and continued uncertainty in international markets. We delivered double-digit segment operating earnings growth in our Safety & Protection, and Nutrition & Health segments.
Volume gains in Nutrition & Health, along with productivity improvements in Safety & Protection, provided substantial margin improvement across these businesses. And contributed to strong operating earnings growth. Nutrition & Health improved margins almost 200 basis points, and Safety & Protection improved margins more than 300 basis points in the quarter.
In Agriculture, earnings were up due to strong insecticide and fungicide volumes in Latin America, which benefited from new product launches. However, seed sales were lower due to well-known reduction in corn seed planted acres and lower corn seed pricing in Latin America.
In our Performance Materials segment, operating earnings were up slightly year-over-year. As increased demand for auto and industrial markets was offset by the sale of GLS/Vinyls earlier in the year. In Performance Chemicals, lower prices for refrigerants and TiO2, coupled with the negative impact of portfolio changes resulted in 5% lower segment operating earnings in the quarter.
Turning now to slide 4. Sales were down 3% on a global basis, almost entirely due to the portfolio changes we've undertaken in line with our strategic focus. Volume gains were offset by lower prices.
Our sales in developing Asia were up 4%, led by China where most businesses realized volume improvements during the quarter. In fact, our sales in China delivered more than three-fourths of the growth we saw in developing Asia. The volume increases were partially offset by currency, price, and the impact of portfolio changes.
In EMEA, while about half of the decline in sales is due to portfolio changes, sales were sluggish in both developing and developed countries, reflecting weak demand in most markets. We currently see this sluggish demand continuing in EMEA for the remainder of the year. Sales declines in the Americas were the result of portfolio changes, and lower agricultural sales.
Turning now to slide 5. You see that our 20% growth in operating earnings-per-share in the quarter is attributable to a combination of segment operating earnings growth, lower interest expense, a slightly lower tax rate, and the benefit of lower shares outstanding. Portfolio changes also had a negative impact to the operating earnings of about $0.03 per share in the quarter.
As you know, in recent months, the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all currencies. While adverse currency impact in the third quarter was minor on a year-over-year basis, we see a strong headwind in the coming quarters. For the fourth quarter, we now expect at least $0.05 per share year-over-year, this compares to our expectation in July of virtually no currency impact in the second half.
Turning to slide 6. Our free cash flow for the first nine months of 2014 versus last year has improved about $400 million. This is due primarily to the absence of tax payments related to the sale of performance coatings, which occurred in 2013.
Consistent with prior years, we anticipate strong seasonal cash flow in the fourth quarter. With a challenging ag environment, we see additional headwinds, which may impact our full-year free cash flow. Net debt at September 30th reflects our normal seasonal pattern of cash flows, and is up about $800 million from the prior year.
In August, we entered into a $700 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to substantially complete our $2 billion share repurchase commitment for 2014. We expect final settlement of the ASR in the fourth quarter.
We estimate that average diluted shares outstanding for the full year will be about 922 million shares, and 913 million shares for the fourth quarter. As we've said, share repurchases are one way we return value to our shareholders, and we use them to complement our strong dividends.
Last week, our Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.47 to be paid in December. In total, by year end, we will have returned nearly $9 billion to our shareholders since 2009 in the form of dividends. Representing a 15% increase in our quarterly pay out during that period.
In addition, during the same period, we will have completed more than $4 billion in share repurchases. Under our current share repurchase plan that was announced in January of 2014, we have completed $2 billion of the $5 billion program.
Moving now to slide 7. I'll just reiterate that our redesign initiatives are underway in delivering about $0.02 of benefit in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our outlook includes about $0.04 of benefit from these actions.
Additionally, as we said in July, we're well on track for our Performance Chemicals separation, with expected filing of the Form 10 with the SEC in mid-December of this year. And we expect separation costs to be about $0.16 per share this year, and about $0.19 to $0.22 per share next year. In addition, we have now finalized all the key leadership appointments for the new Performance Chemicals organization to ensure a successful spin in mid-2015.
Regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter, we clearly see uncertainties in the global economy. Shifts in the agricultural industry, along with stiffer currency headwinds. However, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver on cost productivity, and other corporate initiatives.
Overall, we expect our fourth-quarter operating earnings-per-share to grow about 20% from last year's $0.59 per share. Matching the growth rate achieved in the third quarter, and within our previously communicated outlook range of $4 to $4.10 per share for the full-year. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year is in line with current street estimates.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?
Greg Friedman
I'd now like to provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are posted on the Investors center website, under Events and Presentations. Along with the other materials for today's call.
Turning to Safety & Protection on slide 8. Third-quarter segment operating earnings of $201 million increased 18%, and operating earnings margins increased over 300 basis points. Operating earnings are benefiting from improved margins and rich mix, increased demand from industrial markets, and continued benefits from cost productivity.
Kevlar demand growth was driven by increased sales into transportation, industrial, and wire and cable sectors. While Nomex demand growth was fueled by thermal industrial automotive applications.
Regionally, sales volume growth in Asia-Pacific and the US was offset by lower volumes in Latin America and Europe. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales growth in the mid single-digit range, and earnings growth in the high single-digit percent range on the higher operating margins and sustained operational productivity.
On slide 9, this was another strong quarter for our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales were up 4%, led by volume growth in specialty proteins, probiotics, and cultures, and continued momentum in enablers. We continued to expand in emerging markets, growing segment sales 10% in the quarter.
Operating earnings were up 23% to $100 million from the higher sales and operating margin improvement, due to mix enrichment, productivity actions, and lower raw material costs. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.
In the fourth quarter, we expect low single-digit percent sales growth from broad-based volume gains, including continued growth in emerging markets. This is expected to be partially offset by headwinds in Western Europe, which remained weak from repercussions of the Russia food import ban and a negative impact from currency. Operating earnings are expected to be up in the mid single-digit percent range of sales growth, improved mix, productivity actions, and lower raw material costs.
In our agriculture segment on slide 10, third-quarter results are largely driven by the Summer growing season in Latin America. A seasonal operating loss of $55 million was slightly better than the prior year, and in line with our expectations heading into the quarter, despite an increasingly challenging environment in agriculture. During the quarter, we saw a further decline in corn and soybean commodity prices, as farmers in North America anticipate a record harvest.
Sales for the quarter were 4% below the prior year, as a volume growth in insecticides and fungicides, mainly in Latin America, was more than offset by lower corn seed and herbicide volumes. Price for the segment was down 2%, resulting from lower corn seed prices in Brazil as anticipated, and the negative impact of currency, primarily the real. In segment operating earnings, lower seed input costs and operating cost improvements were partially offset by the lower sales and the absence of a prior year $26 million gain from the acquisition of a controlling interested in Pannar.
As we wrap up the 2014 North America growing season, the USDA won't issue final 2014 acreage until January of next year. However, based on the October preliminary estimate, a 90.9 million acres, North America corn market share likely declined between 1 to 2 points 2014 following strong gains in 2013 and over the past several seasons. In soybeans in North America, 2014 market share is expected to be between 1 and 2 points lower as we continue to transition our line up to new higher performing Pioneer T series varieties, and launch products containing the Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.
Turning to the outlook. The fourth quarter in agriculture is driven by the completion of the Brazil Summer season, and shipments to position product for the upcoming safrinha season in Brazil and for the 2015 northern hemisphere seasons. The operating environment will continue to be challenging, as farmer net income and corn planted area remain under pressure across the globe. In addition, a stronger US dollar against the real, euro, and rand will likely create stronger headwinds to sales and operating earnings.
In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be about flat. For the segment, we expect continued growth in crop protection volumes to be offset by lower corn seed price in Brazil, and the negative impacts of currency. Operating earnings are expected to be positive for the second year in a row, and similar to or above the prior-year's fourth quarter.
As we begin to look forward to the 2015 season, we are pleased with what our customers are seeing during the corn and soybean harvest. And we'll provide further details on Pioneer brand competitive performance in the next few weeks.
The broad scale launch of our Encirca yield service, where the nitrogen management has exceeded our expectations as growers look to maximize profitability on every acre. In Crop Protection, performance of our new product launches in customer fields is very encouraging.
While it is too early to speak for planted area or earnings expectations for next year, we do anticipate 2015 will be a dynamic challenging year for farmers, given a reduced net cash income and growing global grain stocks following this year's harvest. However, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for sustainable demand growth in agriculture.
In Performance Materials on slide 11, sales were down 3%, due primarily to the impact of a portfolio change. Absent the portfolio change, volumes and prices increased across the segment. Operating earnings were up 1% on solid demand in automotive, construction and industrial applications.
Ethylene margins in the quarter were at record levels, driven by high ethylene prices and low cost ethane. Our industry-leading operating margins were near 24%, fueled by favorable ethylene dynamics, and the continued benefit of productivity measures.
In the fourth quarter, we anticipate flat sales as the impact of portfolio changes offsets anticipated volume growth. We expect operating earnings percent growth in the high teens on improved margins and mix.
Turning to Industrial Biosciences on slide 12. Operating earnings were up 4%, as the ethanol industry fundamentals remained favorable during the quarter which drove increased volume for DuPont's novel enzymes.
In other key end markets, demand was mixed. Sales of Sorona polymer for carpeting were flat, due to softer demand and existing home sales partially offset by increased sales of Sorona in [apparel].
We continue to see solid demand for Axtra Phy in animal nutrition and healthy food enzyme sales. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales will be up in the mid-single-digit percent range, above prior-year's record revenue. Fourth-quarter operating earnings are expected to be up substantially, on richer mix, higher sales, and improved product costs.
On slide 13, sales in Electronics & Communications were 2% lower in the quarter. Volume growth in several product lines was more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste.
Operating earnings of $94 million were $3 million lower, as lower sales and a decrease in other income were partially offset by productivity gains. Segment results were negatively impacted by declines in Solamet pate, as intense competition has impacted price and share in this business.
The fourth quarter, we expect to launch a new advantage paste product in the PV market. The photovoltaic market continues to be an attractive space for DuPont. We are the market and technology leader, and are driving a robust innovation pipeline aimed at furthering solar cell efficiency in module life time, which will support continued growth in the overall market.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow, fueled by installations in China. We anticipate the photovoltaic paste market will remain competitive, and expect continued strength in consumer electronics. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to be down in the low single-digit percent range, primarily due to lower metals pricing with operating earnings up in the mid single-digits percent range.
In Performance Chemicals on slide 14, segment sales of approximately $1.6 billion were down 8%, due primarily to a portfolio change in chemicals and fluoro products. Prices for this segment were lower in aggregate, with slightly higher volumes in chemicals and fluoro products, offset by lower volumes in Ti02. Operating earnings were down 5%, primarily due to lower segment prices.
In Ti02, volumes were down 2% from the prior year, due primarily to slower demand from economic challenges in Europe. Year-to-date, Ti02 volume has improved 2% versus the prior year. Despite gradual improvement in industry fundamentals, Ti02 prices were down 1% sequentially, and 3% on a year-over-year basis.
We believe our customers inventory levels are stable, and producer levels remain essentially unchanged. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate low single-digit percent sales growth and operating earnings growth in the high teens percent range on improved volumes and productivity measures.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ellen for her closing thoughts.
Ellen Kullman
Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.
As Nick highlighted, we delivered a solid quarter, with 20% operating earnings-per-share growth. We accomplished this despite a weakening environment in agriculture, softer demand in Europe, and the impact of our portfolio changes.
Our continued focus on productivity, innovation, and disciplined execution served us well. We'll continue to rely on that formula in the coming quarters to navigate a persistently challenging and volatile external market.
This morning, I'd like to step back and place the progress we are making in the context of our broad strategic plan. We have been moving steadily forward on clear path to deliver higher growth, and higher value for our shareholders. Executing a plan that is delivering value today, while positioning us for future growth.
A key element of that plan, creating two strong independent companies through the spinoff of our Performance Chemical business, is on track and on schedule. Following the spin, DuPont will continue to advance our three areas of strategic priority.
In Agriculture and Nutrition, we are extending our leadership position across the high-value science driven segments of the agriculture to food value chains. In Advanced Materials, we are strengthening and growing our leading position in high-value materials businesses by leveraging new technologies. In Industrial Biosciences, we're building transformational new businesses, leveraging our world leading biotechnology capability.
Through these areas of focus, we are helping customers find solutions to respond to growing global demand for more, safer, nutritious food; high-performance, cost-effective, energy-efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and increasingly, renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. We know that our progress in these areas and the value it creates are of primary importance to our customers and our shareholders. As we leverage the full capability of DuPont to create a new outcomes in these spaces, we're building on the key actions we have taken over the past five years to increase growth and value.
These include ongoing portfolio refinements to focus on emerging areas of opportunity, aggressive cost management and productivity improvements, and disciplined capital allocation. Our actions have delivered strong results.
Since 2008, our total shareholder return through September 30th was more than 250% substantially above the S&P 500, and our proxy peers. During the 2008 to 2013 time period, we more than doubled our operating earnings, excluding pharma, and delivered a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted segment operating margins due to productivity improvements.
Throughout this period, we also remained committed to returning capital to shareholders. We returned more than $9 billion to shareholders through dividends since 2009. During the same period, we reinvested about $18 billion in capital expenditures and research and development to grow the long-term value of our Company.
In addition, share repurchases have accelerated, and we executed $2 billion of our $5 billion share buyback program. Looking ahead, we are committed to reinvesting for long-term sustainable growth, while returning capital to shareholders.
As most of you know, we describe DuPont is a science company. That's because over the course of our history, we have created novel solutions for the needs of any given era by connecting our science to the marketplace. We're doing this today as we leverage our unique combination of world-class science and technology, deep value chain knowledge, and deep market insight to solve big customer's problems on a global scale.
This total system of innovation continually renews our portfolio by creating entirely new product lines, and a steady flow of new and end market applications for our products. In parallel, our innovation system also delivers new ways to lower the cost of making our products. This combination of new products, new market applications and lower manufacturing costs is how our innovation system has enabled us to prosper over so many decades.
In 2013, this innovation delivery system generated $10 billion in revenue from new products launched over the prior four years. Our global reach and infrastructure significantly enhances our ability to access and penetrate new markets, where we deploy our rich offering of product and solutions to new customers. In developing countries, where our sales have almost doubled in the past five years, our agriculture business, as first entrant opens the doors for our other businesses.
You can see the full force of DuPont's portfolio leverage, and competitive advantages at work in many of our sector categories. In Energy, for example, our portfolio of products and technologies are delivering complex solutions that help secure a better energy future, and meet a wide range of customer needs.
In Advanced Materials, we provide multiple products for traditional oil and gas application to increase output or reduce downtime between repairs. We provide Nomex products for wind energy applications, and Solamet and Kevlar products for photovoltaics.
In Industrial Biosciences, we are a global leader in biofuels with our ethanol fuel enzymes. In advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol enhanced by Pioneer's product offering, deep agronomic knowledge, and access to growers. In Performance Materials, our products and application know-how are vital to create lightweight vehicles and improve fuel efficiency.
With our current portfolio, we are a single source of multiple solutions, and we are well-positioned to shape and leverage emerging trends. Importantly, we are uniquely positioned to capture the full breadth of the emerging bio-based opportunity, with all the capabilities needed to create new categories of renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. DuPont's pipelines of next-generation renewable products is poised to drive important growth for the Company, which will create long-term benefit for our shareholders.
These opportunities draw directly on the knowledge and science capability of our bio-based businesses, the chemistry and material science of our Advanced Materials businesses, and the feedstock knowledge from our agriculture businesses. With these competitive advantages as a foundation, we recognized that we need to keep driving for improved productivity and efficiency.
This year, we continued to take decisive action to build on our strength, to focus our efforts on areas where our science is advantaged, and accelerate our productivity initiatives. In 2014 alone, we have completed five portfolio actions to further streamline our portfolio, aligned with our science. And as I mentioned, we remain on schedule to separate Performance Chemicals' segment in mid-2015.
Beyond portfolio optimization, we are accelerating our existing cost and productivity efforts. Over the past five years, we consolidated 23 businesses into 12, and reduced senior leadership by more than 20%. These measures have strengthened our operating leverage, as evidenced by our strong margin improvements during the same period.
Our improved processes are driving quicker decision making, yet we recognize the need to do more. This year, we are implementing a high-performing operating model for the post-spin DuPont, with a streamlined structure and a smaller cost base. Following a comprehensive review of our cost structure in connection with the pending Performance Chemicals separation, we announced our fresh start redesign initiative, which is expected to result in savings of at least $1 billion.
As we execute our separation plans, we will continue to explore opportunities to further streamline both Companies and deliver value for DuPont's shareholders. Against this backdrop of progress and momentum, one of our shareholders, Trian Fund Management, has publicly disclosed a proposal made to DuPont. We value their input, as we do the import of all of our shareholders.
In that regard, we have held a number of constructive discussions with Trian. We considered Trian's ideas in the context of our plan to build a higher growth, higher value company. And we believe Trian's proposals in certain important respects are aligned with the direction we set more than five years ago, and the related actions we are taking.
However, we know that our businesses enjoy competitive advantages from being part of DuPont. The combined power of DuPont's science platform, our global scale, market access, and infrastructure leverage, along with our established brand and solid financial foundation have enabled us to deliver strong returns and will continue to do so in the future.
In addition, our current capital structure provides us with important financial flexibility we need to pursue strategic growth opportunities in light of regional and highly seasonal agricultural cash flows. We know our investors share our goals for delivering increased value, and we will continue to dialogue with all shareholders.
In closing, our Board of Directors, our management team, and I, are confident our plan will deliver sustained and superior value for our shareholders. Our track record demonstrates that we have a winning strategy in place, and are never finished with operational improvement and portfolio refinement, guided by our science advantage to create significant value for our shareholders. We are moving forward with urgency and purpose to deliver the increased value you expect, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you.
Greg?
Greg Friedman
Thanks, Ellen. Let's now open the line for questions on the Company's third-quarter results and our strategy.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
Mike Ritzenthaler â Piper Jaffray & Co.
Yes, good morning. Just maybe kick it off here by asking for a bit more color on what's driving the conviction behind the 4Q results and ag being flat or higher year over year, given some of the uncertainties around 2015, and some of the price card changes to products that contain Herculex 1 in Brazil. Just looking for you to weigh those kinds of things.
Ellen Kullman
Great, Mike. Thanks for the question. We expect the weaker environment in ag to continue. But there are some positives that are occurring. You see it in our crop protection volume, with our new launches like Dermacor that are taking hold. Seed input costs are lower, so that's a benefit from an earnings standpoint. We expect shipments for North American safrenha to be about similar with what we saw in the fourth quarter last year, so that's kind of a draw.
Certainly, currency is going to be a negative. But as you know, we've been driving productivity and cost discipline. And so, as you factor all those things together, we're going to see the kind of results we talked about in the fourth quarter.
Mike Ritzenthaler â Piper Jaffray & Co.
Okay, that makes sense. And a question on FX: It seemed like this quarter, or I'm sorry, looking into the fourth quarter, the $0.05 headwind being more or less offset by some of the portfolio and productivity actions. Is that a reasonable framework to think about how things may play out in 2015? Obviously, impossible to guess were FX is going to go, but in terms of the portfolio actions and productivity actions that you're embracing, could that offset potential FX headwinds?
Ellen Kullman
Nick?
Nick Fanandakis
Yes, Mike. As you said, it's extremely difficult to try to forecast what 2015 is going to do. I believe 2015 will remain a currency headwind for us as we start out the year. And we're talking, like I said, the fourth quarter of this year being at least $0.05 in the way of a headwind, where before we were saying it was going to be essentially flat.
The work we're doing around Fresh Start in the fourth quarter will go a long way to offsetting that currency headwind that we're going to experience in quarter four. We're looking to see about $0.04 benefit there from that productivity effort.
And, as far as our ongoing efforts, Fresh Start â we'll continue to see value realized from that work, as well as our underlying DNA productivity work that we have going on in all businesses in all functions, where we're always looking to, at a minimum, offset inflation. But it's too difficult to call at this point in time what the exact trade-off will be between the exchange rates for 2015, and some of those other efforts we have under way.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeff Zekauskas â JPMorgan
Thanks very much. Ellen, will the DuPont Board formally vote on the Trian proposal of splitting the Company into an industrial piece, and, call it, a life sciences or agricultural piece? Or will it not do so?
Ellen Kullman
Well, as you know, Jeff, we've been actively engaged with constructive dialogue with Trian for over a year. Each one of these engagements, the Board has been informed and/or involved in some of those discussions. We continue to dialogue with them, and that's part of the process. We do it with all of our shareholders, and those conversations are private, and we continue to drive forward on delivering our plan for increased value.
Jeff Zekauskas â JPMorgan
Okay. And then for my follow-up, what's your theory of why the North American corn business lost 1 point or 2 of share in corn? And how might that share loss be remedied in the future?
Ellen Kullman
Sure. As you know, just to put it in some perspective, in corn in North America, we've gained some 7 points of share between 2008 and 2013. Last year, even gaining 1 point of share. And this year, it's a very competitive market. Corn acres are down. There's a lot of activity going on.
And it looks like, if the USDA numbers hold true when they come and finalize them in January, that we lost about 1 point this year or a little more than that. We're confident in our future. We gained 1 point last year; this year we lost a little bit.
Next year we've got a great lineup. I'm very confident in the pipeline with the new genetics, and the expanding triple portfolio. It's a very competitive market, area by area, county by county. And I think that we have had good momentum over the past few years, and very confident in our future.
Operator
Our next question is from David Begleiter Deutsche Bank.
David Begleiter â Deutsche Bank
Thank you. Ellen, I noticed that R&D spending was actually down 5% this quarter year over year. Given the focus on R&D overall in the Company, is this more of a trend we should see going forward, or how should we think about R&D spending?
Ellen Kullman
Yes. I think that, first of all, our strategy relative to R&D has not changed, and our focus on it. There are two things that I would say you have to consider when you take a look at any individual quarter.
And one is, is that we do have a portion of our R&D is done by outside vendors. It's some of the testing and the things like that, and a lot of the work that's done there. Those invoices are lumpy and relatively large. So, whether it hits in a quarter or not, it's always hard to predict.
I think the second thing to consider is that we expect our research and development to be as productive as we expect the rest of the Company. It's not a sacred cow, in that they don't have to improve and get more effective every year.
And I think Doug Muzyka has been leading a tremendous effort at really getting more out of the pipeline, and getting more done, and leveraging the resources we have. And so, I'm really proud of the work done there. I think most importantly, our strategy around research has not changed.
David Begleiter â Deutsche Bank
And, Ellen, just on Fresh Start, and Nick as well, is there a phase II to this program? And any way to accelerate some of the savings into 2015 from even 2016?
Ellen Kullman
So, as you know, we've been very aggressive in terms of what we said we'll accomplish in 2015 by the end of the fourth quarter being at a run rate of a savings of $660 million, $600 million-something a year out of the $1 billion a year. We continue to work with the businesses and the functions around the world at the timing of those moves. Some of it has to occur with the spin. Others, we're trying to get ahead of. So, I don't know, Nick, if you want to add anything to that?
Nick Fanandakis
I think, as you look at the numbers, David, and you look at the accrual that we took back in June 30 time period, and it was about â a little over $260 million. And we're talking about $1 billion worth of value that's going to be created. So, obviously, there will be additional work and effort going on around further accruals, and for the savings that will be realized as we projectized a lot of this work that we have going on right now.
Operator
And our next question is from PJ Juvekar from Citi.
PJ Juvekar â Citigroup
Thank you. In soybeans, you are ramping up on the Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, so that mostly explains your share loss there. When do you think you will be fully ramped up on Roundup Ready 2, and would you be able to stop the share loss?
Ellen Kullman
So, when will be â I'm sorry, PJ. You broke up a little bit. Was the question when we'll be fully ramped up on Roundup Ready 2?
PJ Juvekar â Citigroup
Right. When will you be fully ramped up, and when do you expect to stop that share loss?
Ellen Kullman
So, the transitions are occurring now, and it starts small, as you know, and we're in the ramp of the T series. And the ramp is going to be based on performance. We're out there actively looking at the test plots this year; we'll have more data coming through the end of this season.
We continue to focus on getting it ramped as fast as possible, but it has to be based on improved performance than the current varieties. So, we're very confident in that, but I think it's hard to give you, right now at this point in time, an exact percentage and year. And we'll get clearer on that as we get the data from this season, and move into really establishing it for the 2015 season.
PJ Juvekar â Citigroup
Thank you. And a quick question from Nick. And so, Nick, this year in 2014, you benefited from lower pension liability. But with recent rates going down recently, do you expect headwinds in 2015?
Nick Fanandakis
Yes, PJ, obviously with the discount rates declining, that is going to have a negative impact on our pension liabilities as we go forward next year. Just to give you a sizing, if you were to have 100-basis-points reduction in interest rates, it's roughly about a 10% impact on our unfunded pension portion of the liability.
So, it will have an impact. We'll scale that much more definitively as we close out the year, and we look at that January rates as we calculate our unfunded pension going forward.

Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Bob Koort â Goldman Sachs
Thank you, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk â you mentioned that the card prices in Brazil had to reflect some adjustment for the Herculex trait. What do your card prices in North America look like? And what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint from the smaller players in that market? We've heard from your large competitor on pricing, but what's happening across the rest of the markets on corn seed?
Ellen Kullman
Thanks, Bob. As you know, seed establishes the yield and the potential, and farmers take that decision very seriously. Our price cards are flat that we just put out last month. But we think mix is going to be a driver in 2015, as it was in 2014. So, we think there's going to be a positive impact for mix.
Our experience out working in the fields right now is that growers are still demanding high-yielding product, and we're not seeing a trading-down phenomenon, as I think there was some concern about. As for our competition, I don't speak for them. So, we're still looking at having the new genetics and the expanded triples be a positive for us from a mix standpoint in 2015.
Bob Koort â Goldman Sachs
And my follow-up: From a competitive intelligence standpoint, what do you think is happening in the TiO2 markets? Because it seems like, other than China, we haven't heard a lot about capacity beyond your own. Yet it seems like the industry is unable to get any pricing improvement despite, what I think you referenced, a couple percent improvement in volume for the industry this year?
Nick Fanandakis
Maybe I'll handle that, Bob. So, when you look at the TiO2 industry right now and you look at volume, we're going to be up for the year probably about 2%. And that kind of volume is in line with GDP volumes, which, if you look back over time in this business, it tracks GDP, we've always said, very closely.
So, the volumes are coming back in line from a macro perspective. The inventories, if you look at the inventories, at our customer base, they remain stable and in line with historical levels. From a producer basis, it's unchanged at about 60 days. And that's in line with historical averages as well. So, when you look at these market dynamics and what's going on, you would say that the market dynamics are getting stronger and more back to those normalized levels.
As far as the market price, obviously that's an area we're going to continue to monitor and react as the market allows for price increases to occur. Today, it's essentially flattish. If you look sequentially, it may be down just a hair. But it's sequentially flattish, and year over year it's down about 3%. So, that's an area we'll continue to monitor.

Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
John McNulty â Credit Suisse
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, with regard to the Fresh Start program, at the time, you were looking into it and the analysis that went into it, did you look to see if the various business segment leaders and their divisional teams are, in your opinion, incentivized properly to consistently dig out costs out of their businesses? And for that matter, even to grow them and maximize their performance? Or are there tweaks that you think may need to be made with regard to how each of the business leaders think about their businesses?
Ellen Kullman
Thanks for the question, John. We have streamlined our compensation plans over the last few years, aligning them much more closely with increasing shareholder value â aligning the business units much more closely with getting paid on their performance. And that's not only top line, but it's heavily bottom line and cash generation. And we have slopes on those curves that are incentivized upside to the plan to go after it.
And we always look at them versus what their competition is doing. What are you doing versus the competition, and understanding where we pegged that plan. So, there's a lot of incentive locally to generate the revenue and the return, and keeping costs in line in order to be able to make their plan and to participate fully in the benefits from that standpoint, from a compensation standpoint.
So, that's one of the first things we looked at coming out of the global financial crisis is, how do we make sure that it is aligned with where we're driving the Company. And I'm really happy with where that is right now.
John McNulty â Credit Suisse
Great. Thanks for taking my question.

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
Frank Mitsch â Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Good morning, folks. Hey, Nick, when you were talking before about the geographic trends, you mentioned that China was actually a bit of a bright spot in Asia. And obviously, we've been hearing of some concerns in the media, et cetera, about the pace of business over there. Could you take a moment or two and walk us through what exactly is going on in that part of the world, and what your expectations are?
Nick Fanandakis
Sure. Well, China volume was up for us about 8%. Sales were up about 5% in the region. All segments really had positive volume there.
PV in China is going to be key to us having a very strong fourth quarter. I think you realize that we're talking about PV industry in the mid-teens in the way of a year-over-year growth. And China probably represents close to half of that, so it's a big part of the overall PV growth. And we're seeing that, and we're expecting that to be strong in the fourth quarter as well.
Auto builds for China were up about 10% in the third quarter; again, strong performance in that regard. And our sales in crop, a 9% increase there, DPT was up, TiO2 was up. So, across the board, we saw increases within the region.
Frank Mitsch â Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
So, what sort of concerns do you have looking out in Q4 and beyond in that area? And I guess on the same token, you mentioned that EMEA is likely to be sluggish over the next three months. What would your thoughts be as you look out into 2015 in that part of the world?
Nick Fanandakis
Well, EMEA is a concern because it is in a very sluggish mode right now. I read reports that say that they might be heading towards the third recession since the global financial crisis. So, all of Europe is a concern for me, and how quickly it's going to stabilize and start to bounce back.
I think EMEA needs a catalyst; it needs a catalyst for growth. And I'm not sure exactly what that catalyst is going to be, but that's going to be necessary to see a turnaround within the region.
Ellen Kullman
Just one thing I would add to that is that automotive has been holding up Europe for a while, and it's hesitated here towards the end of the year a little bit in Europe. And we think, as you take a look at it, they're predicting automotive to be about the same kind of growth next year as they have seen this year. So, that's going to be a key indicator for us on how we take a look at it.
The other thing I would look at is that nutrition and health really is, in China specifically â I'm back to your China answer â showing great results. We've invested in plants; we're filling those plants. The probiotics are going very, very well. And they're really doing a great job of penetrating a marketplace in China that is crying out for fine space solutions to deal with safety issues and things like that. So, that's a real positive for us from a China standpoint.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
Vincent Andrews â Morgan Stanley
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Maybe we could talk a bit about seed input costs for next year. You noted that they were down in the quarter.
And so, just a couple of things on that. Is what you're seeing now â is that the continued give-back of the price pressures or the cost pressures that came from the 2011 and 2012 drought-type scenario? Or is it you're seeing actually continued relief based on the 2014 harvest, the size of the harvest, and the lower commodity prices?
Ellen Kullman
Yes, I think, as you take a look at it, this all plays together as you go out through time. The input prices were going up, the stocks [to use] were lower. Now that the stocks to use are much higher, those input prices have come down, as we've all seen. And that will have a positive impact on 2015.
This is just one element of many that creates success in that marketplace. But it's one that we actively work and understand how we can make that come out in the right place.
Vincent Andrews â Morgan Stanley
I think, Ellen, you said it was about 100 basis points for 2014, if I'm correct; that was, I think, your last estimate there. Is there any update to that, and should we be expecting about the same in 2015?
Ellen Kullman
I think it's too early to call there. I know we're actively looking at what's coming out of the fields right now and things like that, and what we're doing. And I think we'll able to speak to that with more certainty in the coming weeks and months.

Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Don Carson â Susquehanna Financial Group
Yes, a follow-up question on ag, and that's your South American soy strategy. I know you've launched your Dermacor seed treatment this fall. Just wondering what type of market acceptance you're seeing, and longer term, can you meet your growth objectives in South American soy without having access to an INTACTA license?
Ellen Kullman
First, I want to tell you that I'm very pleased with the Dermacor launch, and what we're seeing. We are on over 3 million acres. It's exceeded our expectation, and I think the team down there has done a great job in that marketplace with that.
So, over time, we continue to understand what we require in order to be successful in that marketplace. It's not only around the germplasm and continuing the genetic side of that, where we've made a lot of gains over the last few years. And so, our product portfolio, we continue to drive it, and we'll see where that goes.
Don Carson â Susquehanna Financial Group
And a follow-up on just consolidation in the agricultural space. There seems to be room for one more large transaction covering both crop protection and seed. What's DuPont's appetite for participating in further major industry consolidation? And are you disadvantaged if you don't participate?
Ellen Kullman
So, we've been very clear around our acquisition strategy, and where we are focused. And ag and nutrition is clearly a focus for us. We understand these marketplaces; we understand the competitive strengths and weaknesses, and our own. And if we ever see that there's an opportunity where there would be benefit to our shareholders by doing something there, we would absolutely drive it.
It is about innovation. It is about connecting to that marketplace. You saw all of the advantages that we've seen from the Pannar acquisition that we completed last year, and that's been a real positive for us. So, we don't believe we're disadvantaged today, but we understand that the market is a very â that there's a lot of change going on in the marketplace, and we have to be right there with it to understand how we can create more advantage going forward.

Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kevin McCarthy â BofA Merrill Lynch
Yes, good morning. Brent crude oil, as you know, is off more than 22% since mid-year. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact of that across the portfolio, and in particular, address whether or not you would expect destocking in any product lines? And also whether or not â it looks to be a record margin in performance materials in the quarter â whether you would view that as sustainable with the high end of the global cost curve coming down overseas for some competitors?
Ellen Kullman
Thanks, Kevin. Oil does have an impact on us. Not as big as it used to with our changing portfolio. It basically impacts us in performance materials, and safety and protection.
It's coming down. Will we see relief on some raw material streams that are greatly impacted it, and there will be maybe a tailwind there from a 2015 standpoint.
Our performance materials margins are industry-leading. But we do understand that there is a component of that that has to do with not only the productivity that we're driving, but low-cost natural gas and record ethylene costs.
So, we do think that there's a parallel impact, not only to oil, but to natural gas, and we'll see where that comes off. But ethylene will change over time, and we have to comprehend that in our future plans. But we continue to watch this and drive it from a very disciplined standpoint.
Kevin McCarthy â BofA Merrill Lynch
As a follow-up, if I may, on the Trian proposal, I think they have estimated excess costs of $2 billion to $4 billion. Do you have any reaction to that? Do you consider it reasonable or unreasonable?
And in their proposed scenario, what would be the dis-synergies of separating the Company in a wholesale fashion, in terms of tax, and financing, and excess overhead, et cetera â any thoughts on that?
Ellen Kullman
Well, let me start by saying that we've been very focused on productivity and from a total cost standpoint for a number of years. If you look just from 2008 to today, we've taken out more than $2 billion in costs through our productivity efforts. And you've heard me speak before that we're never done.
Obviously, like with just wage inflation, there's hundreds of millions of dollars that comes in to our expense line every year that we have to offset that, and we have to continue to drive because our marketplaces are very competitive. So, productivity is a focus for us.
We announced earlier this year, the $1 billion â at least $1 billion from the project Fresh Start. We're continuing to look at how we structure and support our businesses to succeed in the marketplace, and do it in a very efficient manner. And it's a focus area for us.
So, I'm not sure how the $2 billion to $4 billion was exactly calculated. Sales is a very important marketing or a very important cost for us, not only as R&D but in that as well. But we're continuing to engage to understand and see whether there are our other ideas out there because we know, in a competitive marketplace, we have to be very cost effective to be successful. And not only be a great innovator, but be very cost effective.

And itâs from John Roberts from UBS.
John Roberts â UBS
Thank you. Could you give us an update on the Mexican TiO2 expansion plans? And given the market has continued to be soft there, how do you plan to ramp that capacity?
Ellen Kullman
Well, there hasn't been any real change to the timing on that. As you know, we benefit from a very unique technology position that allows us to utilize a wide range of inputs from ores. This enables us to dial down capacity and lower costs â dial up capacity.
And depending on where the market is, it's hard to predict right now where TiO2 will be when that comes on. But we will act appropriately given the dynamics of the market, and make sure that that business is delivering against its commitments to our shareholders.
John Roberts â UBS
Quick follow-up: Nick, did you give a foreign exchange guidance for next year yet? If rates stay where they are, I know you gave the fourth quarter, but what's the headwind for full-year 2015 at the current level?

John, I did not give that. And what I did say is that it's way too soon for me to predict what the headwind on that would be.
