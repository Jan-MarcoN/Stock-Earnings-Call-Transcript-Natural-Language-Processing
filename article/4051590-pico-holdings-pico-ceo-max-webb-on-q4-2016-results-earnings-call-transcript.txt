Good day, and welcome to the PICO Holdings Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to John Perri, PICOâs Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
John Perri
Thank you, and welcome to all of you who have joined us to discuss PICO Holdingsâ financial results for the year-ended December 31, 2016. Our earnings release is available on our Investor website at investors.picoholdings.com under Press Releases.
Iâm here today with Max Webb, our President and CEO; and additionally, Dan Silvers, our lead Independent Director has dialed in separately. Max and I will provide some brief prepared remarks, and then all three of us will be available to answer your questions.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Max Webb.
Max Webb
Thank you, John. Iâll begin todayâs remarks with a review of the progress the company has made over the past year and a brief update on our most significant assets. After that, John will review our current financial position.
The most obvious signs of the company's progress over the last year or so are the significant sales of water, real estate and oil and gas assets, the revised executive compensation plan that is now in place and the Board declassification whereby the five director nominees at this year's annual meeting in May will each be elected to serve one-year terms.
We believe that the company is executing on its stated business plan, at the same time that the Board ensures best-in-class corporate governance. Our most important and significant assets are our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vidler Water Company, and our 56.9% owned subsidiary, UCP, Inc. Vidlerâs water resource assets are unique assets that are for the most part fully developed, and which we expect to provide an essential resource for future economic growth in Arizona, Northern Nevada, and to a lesser extent, Southern Nevada and parts of New Mexico.
We previously announced the closing of the sales of 100,000 acre feet of Long Term Storage Credits for $25 million to two Arizona State agencies. We remain acutely aware that these assets are strategically important due to the structural deficit on the Colorado River.
Additionally, our remaining Long Term Storage Credits are a key component for some of Arizonaâs future water obligations. We continue to have discussions with state water agencies and water users with respect to potential disposition of these assets. Substantial economic growth continues in Northern Nevada, with an employment growth forecast of approximately 52,000 new jobs in the Reno area from December 2014 to December 2019, including an estimated 27,000 new jobs, which have been created through December 2016.
However as residential development activity increases to accommodate the future population growth from this projected increase in economic activity, we are seeing signs of regulatory bottlenecks by local government in the Reno area.
Certain development projects have been required to be re-filed, and this has caused delays in the receipt of final map approvals. Our most recent informal survey of developers in the North Valleys, which we have conducted during the first two months of the first quarter of 2017, suggests that our water credits in that region will not start to be taken down until late 2017 or early 2018, which reflects these approval delays.
That said, we have not seen the same regulatory constraints in Lyon County, Nevada, where we expect the completion of the extension of USA Parkway from the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center to Silver Springs and Lyon County in late 2017, and this means that the USA Parkway will connect Interstate 80 to U.S. Route 250. We believe this project will be a catalyst for increased residential and commercial development, and as a result, demand for water rights in Lyon County.
Moving onto UCP. The company's full-year results were released earlier this week which John will cover in his remarks. Overall we are pleased to see that UCP has significantly improved its operating performance in 2016 as compared to 2015, and has improved its return on equity in assets as they manage their existing landbank and their land acquisitions.
As it relates to UCP, we have taken the step of nominating a highly qualified individual with significant real estate and merger & acquisition and capital markets experience to the UCP Board at this year's annual meeting. Additionally we have made proposals for UCP to implement the same types of good corporate governance policies that we have at PICO.
We continue to monitor our investments in UCP closely, as we seek to pursue our strategy of monetizing our assets. John will detail our current cash position in his remarks. But based on asset monetizations to-date and our conservative estimate of medium-term working capital needs, we estimate we have approximately $20 million available to return to shareholders in the near to intermediate-term. The Board is monitoring the capital markets very closely to determine the most efficient manner to execute this capital return.
That wraps up my brief remarks. And now I will turn the call over to John Perri, who will cover our financial results for 2016.
John Perri
Thank you, Max, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Starting with our cash position, as of December 31, 2016, we had unrestricted cash and securities of $18.6 million. As Max noted in his remarks, we closed on several transactions in 2016 and early in 2017, that generated a significant amount of cash.
In addition, we also collected the nearly $6 million in cash held in the escrow account related to the sale of our canola oil operations. In the foreseeable future, we also expect to receive cash payments from UCP from minimum tax distributions as it continues to produce taxable income. Such income is currently sheltered by our net operating losses.
In summary, at December 31, 2016, we projected that our current burn rate for all cash outlays for overhead, existing water project costs and costs related to the wind down of our oil and gas operations, excluding UCPâs operations, and also excluding the severance payable to our former CEO, was approximately $9.9 million per year, which is net of a modest amount of recurring revenue.
We also estimated that our total expected cash inflows from significant sales and other receipts during 2017 to be approximately $39.5 million, which includes a $25 million for the sale of our water credits that was consummated in early 2017. We believe this provides us the necessary working capital for at least the next 12 months, including the severance payments to our former CEO. As such, as Max noted in his remarks, we have the ability to utilize a significant portion of proceeds from recent asset sales to repurchase shares and/or return capital of shareholders through other means.
I would like to refer you to the Liquidity and Capital Resource section of our 2016 Form 10-K for additional details related to our financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2016, our revenues were approximately $113.1 million, an increase of $5 million from the same period last year, which was due primarily to the sale of the majority of our oil and gas assets.
Total cost and expenses increased approximately $82.2 million to $380.6 million due primarily to an increase in cost of real estate sold and the $11 million in severance expense related to the termination of our former CEO. There were no impairment losses on real estate recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016. However we did write-off our $2.2 million investment in Synthonics and also recorded a $2 million loss upon abandonment of operations in a consolidated subsidiary.
UCP, Inc. reduced the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2016, and as a result, recognized a $5.5 million tax benefit, which is wholly attributable to the non-controlling interests. However we still maintain a full valuation allowance on our other net deferred tax assets.
The resulting loss per share from our continuing operations was $0.38 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, compared to $0.05 for the same period last year. Our shareholdersâ equity declined $6.9 million or $0.30 per share to $328 million, or $14.22 per share. This decline was primarily due to our reported net loss.
Our water resource and water storage operations did not record any significant revenues during the fourth quarter but did reduce total expenses. Our real estate segment reported net income before taxes of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to income of $8.1 million in the previous period. Please see UCPâs recent earnings release and its 2016 Form 10-K for additional results and specific details.
Our corporate segment reported a loss before taxes of $10.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2.4 million in the prior period. We closed on the sale of our oil and gas operations during the fourth quarter of â16 for gross proceeds of $9.6 million, which resulted in recording a gain of $8.7 million, considering we had written down the value of these assets in a previous period.
General and administrative expenses increased during the current quarter, primarily due to the severance expense recorded in conjunction with terminating our former CEO. Such severance, along with the balance in his deferred compensation accounts, is expected to be paid in April 2017.
With that, we will open the call to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And our first question comes from Jon Cukierwar with Robotti & Company. Please go ahead.
Jon Cukierwar
Hi Max. How are you?
Max Webb
Good morning, Jon. Very well. Thank you.
Jon Cukierwar
Thatâs great. I have a few questions, Max. First is regarding your sale of the 100,000 Arizona water rights in early February. Are you able to share at what value you were carrying those assets at on the books, and more generally, did the sale give you a more updated picture of what some of your other water assets in Arizona could be worth?
Max Webb
With respect to the first part of your question, yes, I believe we disclosed that we expect to record a gain of approximately $12.5 million. John Perri is nodding telling me that is correct, so that would imply the carrying value is approximately half of what our ultimate sale price was.
That was a price at the time of the transaction. As weâve stated before, by reducing the amount of credits that are available for resolving some of the Arizona water issues, we believe that that makes our remaining credits more valuable.
Jon Cukierwar
Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Next question I have is regarding, you guys talk about maximizing long-term shareholder value through return of capital and you have $20 million in the near to intermediate future. I know in November 2015, the Board authorized up to $15 million of share repurchases. So if you do consider returning capital this way, then do you have any thoughts on - you can share regarding the timing of any buybacks? The way I see that as PICO continues to liquidate assets significantly above gross value, the market value of PICO might also rise along with the companyâs book value. And so do you believe that in X years from now, after substantial asset liquidation that the company could be worth X dollars per share then in order to maximize the long-term shareholder value, it makes sense to begin buying back the shares at the cheapest price possible which would be today, right?
Max Webb
I believe thatâs certainly an option that the Board would look at very carefully and probably wouldnât disagree with that analysis.
Jon Cukierwar
Okay. And you guys haven't - you guys are still - I know youâve mentioned share buyback before versus evidence but you guys still donât have a clear picture on which route you might go, right?
Max Webb
I think we would consider all options and make the most rational decisions that maximize shareholder value under the circumstances that exist at the time.
Jon Cukierwar
Okay. I appreciate that, Max. And just the last question, do you have any updates regarding your investments in Synthonics and Mindjet? Is there a clear timeline for these exits?
Max Webb
They are both highly illiquid assets. As John mentioned in his remarks, we have written off the balance of the - our carrying value which was our investment cost in Synthonics. We would continue to look for an exit as circumstances allowed, and similarly with Mindjet, which is a pretty small asset that weâre not funding and is held at - John will have to confirm how we account for that, but I think itâs a cost right now.
John Perri
Correct. Currently cost of $2.2 million.
Max Webb
And again, as and when circumstances allow us to provide an exit, we would look to do so.
Jon Cukierwar
Okay. I appreciate that.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Shapiro of Lawndale Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shapiro
Hi. Thank you. A few questions. So you sold, I think, it was around half of the credits that we had in Arizona. Is that right?
Max Webb
No, a little less than that, Andy. Total credits that we have - we did have 157,000 in the Phoenix Active Management Area. So we sold 100,000 of those and we still have approximately 250,000 credits in the Harquahala basin.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. So with respect to - I think itâs the basins where you have the recharge facility. I donât know if itâs one rainy season or it is the flood of all floods and the need for now is arc and the elimination of anyone to worry about the Lower Basin Drought Contingency proposal et cetera. What are the circumstances for which that recharge facility in PICOâs water credits would actually be - would rise and we either get water, accumulate water, we have to buy the water. How does that occur that those balances would actually rise?
Max Webb
Iâm not 100% sure I quite understand the question, Andy, but let me - I think I know what youâre asking. Obviously itâs been a very good year for water in the west, which is - as people who live in the west which is great and itâs certainly alleviating drought conditions. California, Nevada and that will certainly the snowpack will certainly help the Colorado River. The reality is there is still - certainly with respect to the Colorado River, a long-term structural deficit that we see declining water levels in Lake Mead, not just through drought. Thatâs because the decline is occurring because the lower basin states are collectively using more water than is available, drought or no drought, and that is about 1.2 million acre feet.
We do not intend at this time - and we certainly could revisit - but itâs not our intention to repurchase any more water after Colorado River. Weâve seized recharge operations. We have a bucket that we believe that we were able to purchase at - and the water in that âbucketâ was purchased at good prices that is now available to be sold to help alleviate and help resolve some of these structure deficit issues.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. So the only way we increase the water is we actually have to buy it. Itâs not like weâre collecting it in some bucket?
Max Webb
No. You physically have to buy it, recharge it, get it certificated and then becomes a net recharge credit.
Andrew Shapiro
So weâre not doing that. So then with this rain and the reduction of some severe drought circumstances, does that mean the timing for the monetization of - the higher level monetization as you mentioned in your pre-prepared comments, does that mean that the timing of the monetization of some of the remaining credits had higher values gets deferred a bit because of all the extra rains because, yes, as residents of the west, we like the fact that drought is going down but as owners of water assets in the west, we probably benefit more if the drought were to continue.
Max Webb
As I mentioned, I think drought or no drought, there are still issues with water levels and water resources for the Lower Colorado River Basin states because weâre using more water than is available. An example I believe through - I think it was period of 12, 13 years from 2000, there was at least probably nearly eight-and-a-quarter million acre feet released from Lake Tahoe, and I think in 2011, there was about probably about 12.5 million acre feet was released, because again there was an above-average winter snowpack. The water level in Lake Mead still fell. I think it was close to 100 feet because of the structure deficit. So as I said, drought or no drought, there are still water issues and...
Andrew Shapiro
So let me just finalize on this topic, then Iâll back out in the queue. I have other questions on other geographies. But whatâs the latest Lake Mead surface elevation and the key elevation thresholds that weâve been now monitoring and you I think discussed either on the last quarterâs call or the call before?
Max Webb
I believe the key element that youâre referring to elevation level and subject I may be proved wrong, but I believe itâs 1,075 feet. I don't know what the level is today. I did see a recent report that Lake Tahoe would release some water to Lake Mead. So I think it's better than it was if weâre getting very dangerously close to that level. But I couldn't tell you exactly what that level is on this call. I'm very happy - I'm sure Dorothy Timian-Palmer at Vidler knows that level of the top of her head and if you want to call him separately, Andy, Iâm very happy to provide that information.
Andrew Shapiro
Excellent. I'll back out in the queue. Come back. I have more questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kelly Cardwell of Central Square Management. Please go ahead.
Jon Cukierwar
Hi guys. Actually Jon at Robotti. My repurchase questions. Iâll take them off. Thanks.
Max Webb
Okay. Thank you, Kelly.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from John Deysher of Pinnacle. Please go ahead.
John Deysher
Hi. Just a quick question on these accrued severance expenses for the former CEO of $10.4 million, I guess, to be paid in April of this year. Is that the full amount to him? Is there going to be any incremental amounts beyond that $10.4 million?
John Perri
Hi. This is John. Yes, the $10.4 million is certainly the bulk of it. The incremental, I would say, is the net settlement of his restricted stock unit that vested. But in terms of cash, the $10.4 million is the bulk, frankly all of it that needs to be paid in April.
John Deysher
So thatâs going to be the total payment. Whatâs the value of the restricted stock and how does that run through the P&L?
John Perri
That is expense. I believe it was $578,000 accrued up that immediately invested upon his termination. Like I said, that will be net settled into shares in April.
John Deysher
Okay. So nothing beyond the $10.4 million?
John Perri
Thatâs correct.
John Deysher
Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is follow-up question from Andrew Shapiro of Lawndale Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shapiro
Hi, thanks. A few follow ups but a direct follow-up after this gentlemanâs question. So you previously stated that the Board didnât feel that Mr. Hartâs termination met the threshold for cause at that time and thus what has been accrued and intended to be paid is a termination without cause a higher payment. Has any further actions, any further investigation - is that now a done issue and indeed it will be treated as a termination without cause?
Max Webb
I will pass - as we have Dan on the line, I would pass that to Dan.
Dan Silvers
Thanks Max. Hey, Andy, how are you?
Andrew Shapiro
Good.
Dan Silvers
What I would say is that if there were any news of a material nature to report, we would obviously report that through a public filing and I wouldnât take the lack of news as confirmation either one way or the other as to anything and itâs probably best that we leave it at that.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. But from a practical term standpoint, if the payments due in a few months, would that put pretty much a time limit on the alternative?
Dan Silvers
I think that this is probably a topic thatâs best not discussed in this forum.
Andrew Shapiro
With respect to the elimination of the restricted stock units, are these shares considered - are these considered already issued and outstanding shares and then when they are purchased, it would be similar to a buyback where the outstanding share count would drop or these are not yet issued shares, and is it a distribution of shares or will it be a monitory payment and then the shares will never be issued and added to outstanding share count?
John Perri
Hi, Andy, this is John Perri. The shares are not issued as of today. They will be issued in March but they will be net settled as I mentioned. So in essence, we pay the tax in lieu of issuing shares. So he will be issued the net amount at that date and they will be outstanding at that point forward.
Andrew Shapiro
The net amount.
John Perri
Correct.
Andrew Shapiro
And approximately how many shares are estimated to be created net of whatâs tendered to pay the taxes?
John Perri
I think itâs around 5,000 or 6,000 shares.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. Itâs not a bigger number, all right.
John Perri
No. Itâs basically the 578,000 divided by $14.50 or $15, whatever it was at the date of his termination. I donât have that data right in front of me but thatâs roughly the calculation and then maybe it was even lower. Thank you, Max. And then basically a 50% tax withholding rate, and then so the net is the difference.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And I think you gave a little bit of detail on the status update on the development and value enhancement of your other Northern Nevada water rights, not the ones in the North Valley Fish Springs area. But could you give a little more color and the status on the water rights that are, I guess, you would describe to be closer to the Las Vegas area?
Max Webb
Yes, those are our Lincoln County water rights where we have a teaming agreement with Lincoln County. Currently we have, I think, itâs 2900 free and clear water rights with another 4,000 odd acre feet of water rights subject to pumping and monitoring. Again thatâs - the 2,900 would lend itself very well to potential energy project that is occurring or could occur in that area or longer term to some of the development thatâs occurring in Lincoln County or Mesquite remains to be seen.
Andrew Shapiro
Right. But isn't there an application for a whole lot more water rights that is pending?
Max Webb
We have lined up applications but we have not taken any action at this point until we see demand increasing to turn those applications into actual water rights.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And I donât know if this is for you or for Dan. But can you give the expected date for the annual meeting? I think I heard it was going to be potentially up in Reno, or I donât know if it will be in North Valleys or where?
Max Webb
Yes, Andy, I can tell you. Itâs May 4 in Reno at the Peppermill Hotel. The details will be forthcoming in our proxy, which should be filed with a pre-proxy, I donât know, couple two or three weeksâ time, something of that nature. But John may have a more accurate timetable for the filing of that proxy.
John Perri
Yes, we expect to file a proxy on March 10.
Andrew Shapiro
And thatâs the preliminary proxy because this will contain new reincorporation proposals and other items?
John Perri
Thatâs correct.
Max Webb
I think itâs likely that it will, Andy.
Andrew Shapiro
Yes, good.
Max Webb
And by the way, just to give you - to answer your question regarding the level at Lake Mead right now. Dorothy did know that number and she has let me know. Itâs 1,089 feet.
Andrew Shapiro
And 1075 is where certain structural contractual triggers and other things occur with the states, right?
Max Webb
Correct.
Andrew Shapiro
Excellent. And then is anything - is there any status changes to discuss on the development and value enhancement of your water rights and credits in New Mexico, Colorado or any other state?
Max Webb
With respect to the water rights in Colorado, those are fully appropriated water rights that can be sold for certain users and we continue to do so. Weâll lease those out. The ones in New Mexico that we have, there are very small quantities that we can sell and then we are in the process of trying to appropriate a new source of water with the State Engineer of New Mexico.
Andrew Shapiro
So in general has any - Vidler makes these attempts at doing various things and they are pending. I donât think your new 10-K is yet been filed, so Iâm only going off of the last 10-K which had a lot of detail or update on things. Are there ongoing efforts to add to - without having to put out a lot of money, but to add to our water rights where weâve had these applications, or is the focus solely on disposition?
Max Webb
The focus is very much on monetizations, Andy. We are working on the New Mexico water rights that I just talked about where we are attempting to appropriate new water rights and we are in appeal right now with the State Engineer of New Mexico. But Iâd say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, our assets are about pretty much fully developed. There may be some ongoing project costs with respect to, say, the credits where we have to pay property taxes for example or at Fish Springs Ranch where there is some ranch operations, but thatâs it.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And then to finish off, back on Lincoln County, where we do have some water rights that would be go well with energy projects. PICO had some interests either in land or in energy project that was, I guess, dormant proposal. Has there been any movement on that proposal and on that prospective energy project?
Max Webb
To-date, no. But the energy landscape in Southern Nevada or Nevada is potentially changing with some of the legislation thatâs been suggested to remove the âmonopolyâ of Nevada Energy. And so that - itâs possible that certain legislation changes may result in renewed catalyst for that project.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay, excellent. Thank you.
Max Webb
Thank you, Andy.
