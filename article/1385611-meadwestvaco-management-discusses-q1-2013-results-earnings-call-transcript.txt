Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the MWV First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Percy, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we announced our results before the market opened, and a notification of this morning's call was broadly disclosed. Further, this morning's call is being webcast at mwv.com, and slides that accompany this call are available there as well.
I'll briefly remind you that certain statements we make are forward looking and are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in our public filings. Furthermore, contents contain time-sensitive information that, although correct today, may change with the passage of time.
All the results we share this morning are presented on a continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the company's income from continuing operations was $11 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $29 million or $0.16 per share.
Now here to tell you more about our results for the first quarter are John Luke, Chairman and CEO; Jim Buzzard, our President; and Mark Rajkowski, CFO. I'll now turn the call over to John.
John A. Luke
Thanks, Jason, and good morning, all. Our results for the first quarter were very disappointing. Our top line grew modestly due to continued contribution from our profitable growth strategy, and this progress was consistent with the outlook we provided at the time of our last report. However, we had certainly expected earnings to be better than what we reported this morning.
There were a number of factors that led to lower profits in our businesses, many of them unexpected. First, unseasonably cool weather had a negative impact on demand for both beverage and home and garden packaging as well as asphalt additives, especially in late March when we begin the high season -- when we expect the high season for these markets to begin; second, poor economic conditions in Europe led to losses in our beauty and personal care folding carton business there; third, we had higher-than-expected outage costs at the Mahrt paperboard mill and our Specialty Chemicals facilities; and finally, a spike in resin prices impacted our plastic dispensers business. We believe the impact from these items was transitory and isolated. But they combined to have an unplanned pretax impact of $20 million in the quarter.
We are confident that the fundamentals of our strategy are sound. Throughout the quarter, we saw continued evidence that we're successfully capturing growth opportunities around the world. Still, we've pressure-tested our assumptions and expectations for the balance of the year, and we're taking a number of actions to ensure that we resume an earnings trajectory that is consistent with our performance goals and longer-term outlook.
We're continuing to focus on the pillars of our profitable growth strategy, including commercial excellence, innovation, emerging markets and expanded participation. Ongoing work in each of these areas led to positive developments and revenue increases in our targeted markets for Packaging and Specialty Chemicals during the quarter. We earned new food packaging business from several major brand owners and started testing a new application of our shopper-ready packaging system, Captivate, for the beverage market with Coca-Cola. We continued to integrate Ruby Macons in India, which had a positive impact on results as the market there is strong. We had solid gains for our Airless dispensing solutions for personal care and medical plastics solutions for health care markets. And we saw another quarter of volume improvement for our industrial packaging solutions in Brazil, again outpacing the broader industry there.
Many of the things we've done to set a foundation for our profitable growth strategy are paying off with momentum in the marketplace, whether that's beverage machinery placements in emerging markets that have led to new carton volumes in Asia, innovation investment that have led to new product launches or acquisitions of technologies that have led to new business with key consumer products customers. And there's still more to come as we fully ramp up the industrial packaging expansion in Brazil and launch several new products that are in the final stages of trials and testing before moving to full commercialization.
As you can see from the announcements we made this morning, we are very focused on accelerating our progress even further. We have named 2 leaders for our Food & Beverage and Home, Health & Beauty segments, each now singularly responsible for improving performance and reaching our profitable growth targets. We're also further refining our focus on the most profitable products and solutions, including specifically exiting our beauty and personal care folding carton operations in Europe and Brazil and focusing on high-value dispensers for these markets. Jim will have more comments on these plans. And we are well under way with an overhead cost reduction program. In this process, our profitable growth strategy is serving as a guide, aligning resources to our top priority initiatives and eliminating noncore overhead costs. We're aiming for savings of as much as $75 million with a significant portion to be realized this year. Mark will have more details on this.
In addition to these activities, we also made progress during the quarter in evaluating opportunities to unlock the value in our Land Management business. At the end of last year, as market fundamentals improved and our business had a number of positive developments, we retained advisors to help evaluate options that maximize the value of our forestland holdings, our properties with mineral rights and our development properties in the Charleston, South Carolina region. With respect to these development properties, which comprise about 100,000 acres, we will consider structures in which MWV retains control and the existing MWV development team remains engaged to ensure that the stewardship commitments made to the community are fulfilled and that our shareholders benefit from the significant value that has been and will continue to be created with these properties.
We remain committed to and focused on achieving our goals for business performance and shareholder value, and we're confident we can do so with continued progress on our profitable growth strategies and new and ongoing projects related to productivity and cost reduction.
Despite lower-than-expected results for the first quarter, we are confident that we're pursuing the right strategy and that our progress will turn into renewed earnings growth in the second half of this year.
I'll now turn to Jim for commentary about our performance in each segment, including detail on the items that impacted our performance during the quarter. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Thank you, John. While there were some significant external factors impacting our performance in the first quarter, we also had a number of operating challenges. We simply did not operate at the level we are accustomed to. Unlike external influences, such as weather or currency fluctuations, these issues are in our control, and we're addressing them. These efforts, along with the actions John described a moment ago, will ensure we deliver consistent quarterly performance and achieve our long-term financial goals. While the environment is still very difficult, we are confident that we can combine improved earnings -- improved operating performance with our profitable growth strategies to return to the earnings trajectory both we and our shareholders expect.

The operational issues during the quarter happened primarily at our Mahrt paperboard facility and 3 of our Specialty Chemicals facilities. All had major outages during the period that ran longer and cost more than we planned. The total impact was $14 million more in outage-related costs than the first quarter last year.
We also continued to be affected by poor results from our beauty and personal care folding carton operations in both Brazil and Europe, and these operations lost money during the first quarter. We are exiting this business to improve our focus on attractive, profitable growth opportunities for our higher-value dispensing solutions for fragrance, make up, soap and lotion categories in the beauty and personal care markets. As John noted, these were some of the issues that impacted our overall performance during the quarter.
Now I'll provide some more detail about performance in each of our segments. The broad Food & Beverage markets were challenged in the quarter by a number of factors. The beverage market was negatively impacted by a weak European economy, a cool and wet start to spring and ongoing shifts in consumer preference away from carbonated soft drinks.
In the broad food markets, volumes were up marginally as demand was impacted by lower consumer spending, the weather and continuing economic challenges. Against this backdrop, our shipments of bleached paperboard increased 4% compared to last year, and CNK shipments increased by 7% based on strong volume gains in the food end markets.
Our gains in paperboard volumes are driven by our commercial excellence initiatives with key brand owners. Strong value propositions, including the use of carton board to replace corrugated, lightweighting to provide sustainability benefits and preferred paperboard characteristics for premium tobacco applications in China, all helped drive these gains. We also saw solid carton growth in Asia resulting from the beverage packaging machines we've placed in the region over the last few years. The multi-pack format there is growing well, though off of a relatively small base.
Another exciting development for us in the beverage market is our innovative package variety station with Coca-Cola. The first prototype was in a test market during the first quarter, and we're extending tests to additional regions later this year.
Pricing during the quarter was unchanged for our CNK grades and declined by 3% for SBS as a result of competitive pressures that developed during 2012. Product mix was also impacted in the first quarter by a temporary loss of business from a customer due to a change in product specifications. We have developed a modified product that is currently in trial process and performing extremely well, and we fully expect to recover this business during the remainder of 2013. Earnings were lower in the quarter due to lower beverage volumes, lower SBS pricing and product mix, inflationary pressures and the impact of the paperboard mill outages.
In the second quarter, we expect to see continued volume gains from our commercial excellence initiatives and improved demand in Food & Beverage markets. In addition, our pricing will begin to improve as we implement recently announced increases. However, a planned once-every-5-year cold mill outage at Covington will result in lower segment profit compared to the second quarter last year.
The Home, Health & Beauty markets also reflected underlying challenges in the first quarter. Weaker consumer spending in Europe and North America impacted personal care volumes, and unseasonably cold and wet weather in North America delayed the start of the spring lawn and garden season. Our customers reported a significant drop in retail activity for the period, and our results reflect this impact. Further, high resin costs were an added drag on our results in the first quarter.
As we entered the second quarter, however, there were several positive developments in the segment. First, we will be introducing our new all-plastic trigger sprayer, Versa Plast [ph], for the home and automotive cleaning markets in North America. This innovation, based on the technology we acquired with Spray Plast, offers a much enhanced consumer experience and a more sustainable solution through less resin and a lighter weight than similar offerings. Further, we expect to recapture some of the delayed lawn and garden business in the coming weeks.
In health care, the transition from Shellpak to Shellpak Renew continues to go well. While there are the expected inventory transition issues from any major move of this nature, we continued to see strong interest in these prescription adherence packaging solutions from major pharma companies and retailers alike. In the quarter, we were gratified to win a Responsibility Award from Wal-Mart for the health and wellness benefits provided by Shellpak Renew. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our plastic medical pumps and dispensers, evidence that our product solutions are gaining increased acceptance in the markets based on the value we provide.
In the beauty and personal care markets, we made continued progress through commercial excellence initiatives with key customers. Revenue from our top 30 accounts in this business was up solidly compared with the first quarter last year with strong sales of our Airless dispensers and fine mist sprayers for luxury beauty categories.
In the second quarter, we expect continued progress toward improving returns in the Home, Health & Beauty segment. Home and garden volumes will improve as the springtime home and lawn maintenance season finally ramps up in North America. And we expect continued strong gains from our dispensing solutions, especially medical plastics in health care. We'll also begin to recapture some of our resin costs with contractual price increases throughout the quarter. With these improvements, we expect earnings in the second quarter to be in line with the level from last year.
In our Industrial segment, the markets in both Brazil and India are being impacted by somewhat slower economic activity. Our sales increased with continued volume gains in Brazil and the addition of Ruby Macons in India, which contributed about $20 million to the top line in the first quarter. This is consistent with our expectations for the integration of Ruby Macons, which is going very well, and the relatively stronger markets in India, which is why we're excited about the long-term potential of this business. Sales in Brazil were also up with recovering volumes in food markets and paperboard sales from the new machine as well as from improved pricing as we have begun raising box prices to offset inflation. The corrugated industry is outpacing GDP slightly in Brazil, and we continue to gain market share with volume growth that exceeds our competitors'.
Earnings in the Industrial segment were lower, however, due to the impact of wage and materials inflation, which is accelerating across industries in Brazil, and lower productivity as we continue to ramp up the Tres Barras expansion project. In the second quarter, we expect to see improvement in earnings compared to the prior year as a result of the growing benefit of our expansion at Tres Barras, continued volume increases in Brazil and India and the positive impacts from ongoing pricing actions to offset accumulated inflation.
In Specialty Chemicals, another quarter of solid sales growth resulted from continued gains in markets for pine chemicals, including our value-added solutions for adhesives and oilfield drilling as well as strong sales of carbon technologies. We also had a positive contribution from the acquisition of Resitec in Brazil, where sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis.
In carbon technologies, we saw modest volume growth in our auto solutions. While the auto manufacturers posted sales gains in North America for the quarter, overall production of vehicles destined for North America was actually down slightly in the quarter as the auto companies managed inventories in their systems. Our volume reflected continued gains in key international automotive markets, including Europe and China.
Our operating performance in Specialty Chemicals unfortunately did not match our commercial performance in the quarter. We had over 20 days of planned and unplanned outages compared to only a few days last year, and these incremental costs combined to impact productivity by about $6 million. This, along with ongoing investments to support growth, contributed to lower overall segment earnings in the quarter.
We expect second quarter profits for the Specialty Chemicals segment to be in line with last year's record performance. We are seeing solid recovery in asphalt solutions after a slow start to the paving season in many regions and expect to continue to have volume gains in other pine chemicals markets. The operational challenges are largely behind us, and we do not expect incremental planned maintenance outage expenses in the quarter.
In Community Development and Land Management, we continued to see good momentum along all fronts of our value creation strategy. And, as John said, we are working on the logical steps to maximize shareholder value from this business.
We closed 14 land sales transactions totaling approximately 11,300 acres, both well ahead of last year's pace, not including the large single forest land tract we sold in the first quarter last year. The value per acre we received continues to increase with improved market conditions and a better mix of properties. We expect these trends to continue as interest in high-quality land picks up steadily.
And as you may have read, there were several recent events that validate our development strategy in the Charleston region, including new investments by Boeing. As a result, our Nexton project continues to do very well. We signed a contract for a 10-acre site on which the South Carolina research authority will build up to 100,000 square feet of office space, which is in addition to the 100,000-square-foot multi-tenant building already under construction. As we move through 2013, we expect to see a growing contribution to segment results from these and other development activities.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mark. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Jim. There were several factors that led to disappointing results during the first quarter. Clearly, the external environment proved to be more challenging than expected with unseasonably cool weather delaying the strong selling period in a few of our key end markets and recessionary conditions in Europe and general softness in North America impacting our business in developed markets. As a result, we had weaker sales of some higher-margin business, which impacted mix, and we also saw lower pricing in some of our paperboard solutions. We also didn't operate up to our standards, particularly around the outages at several facilities. The combination of these factors negatively impacted the results in our consumer packaging and chemicals businesses.
So far during the second quarter, we're starting to see improvement in seasonal end markets such as beverage, home and garden and asphalt. We're also generating price improvement in key paperboard end markets and in our industrial packaging business in Brazil. These are good signs.
However, we're taking additional measures to accelerate earnings growth. We're exiting our beauty and personal care folding carton businesses in Brazil and Europe and further reducing overhead costs throughout the enterprise. We are moving aggressively with these actions and expect to see benefits beginning in the second half of 2013.
In a moment, I'll provide more detail on the actions we're taking, including timing and expected financial impact. But first, I'll quickly run down the quarter.
Starting with sales, a seasonally weak quarter for our business was also impacted by cooler weather versus last year. We saw very weak sales volumes in March for our beverage and home and garden packaging solutions as well as in our asphalt business and Specialty Chemicals. Not only did we feel the volume impacts from lower sales of these solutions, but the mix was also unfavorable.
Despite these challenges and continued currency headwinds, we did generate overall revenue growth of over 2% from solid volume gains in retail food, tobacco paperboard and industrial packaging in Brazil. We also had volume gains in targeted pine chemicals and carbon markets in Specialty Chemicals, as well as contributions from the Ruby Macons and Resitec acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Our adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $75 million versus $127 million last year on the same basis. As John highlighted, there were several significant factors that reduced our earnings year-over-year, including approximately $20 million of unexpected impacts related to our outages, weather-related sales declines, higher resin costs and weaker earnings in our European folding carton business. The quarter was also negatively impacted by the planned ramp-up of our Brazil expansion, weaker price and mix in our Food & Beverage segment and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Adjusted SG&A of $162 million was 12% of sales, which was essentially flat versus the prior year on the same basis.
While there were several transitory issues that impacted first quarter's results, we are restless for renewed earnings and cash flow growth. As you heard from John and Jim, we're taking action to strengthen our business model to ensure that we deliver the performance commitments that we've made to shareholders.
We continue to expect to deliver measurable earnings improvement in the second half of this year not only from the new set of actions that we're taking but also from the big drivers of earnings and cash flow growth that we've invested in, including the expansion of our Brazilian industrial packaging business, cost and productivity benefits from our Covington biomass boiler and contributions from recent bolt-on acquisitions.
In terms of the new actions that we're taking to accelerate profitable growth, first, as Jim outlined, we're exiting our beauty and personal care folding carton business in Europe and Brazil. We've already begun the process to repurpose our Brazilian folding carton facility to produce higher-margin pumps and dispensers to leverage our advantaged products in what is now one of the world's largest beauty and personal care markets. Exiting these businesses will improve our operating margins in Home, Health & Beauty segment by over 100 basis points when these actions are completed.
We're also moving forward with overhead cost reduction actions that will generate annual savings of $65 million to $75 million by 2014. These savings will be driven from structural changes and consolidation throughout our businesses in corporate overhead and will largely be achieved through our targeted reduction of 275 to 300 positions throughout the company. We've already initiated a number of actions and expect savings of $25 million to $30 million in 2013, largely in the second half of this year. Cash costs for these actions are not expected to be significant due to the ability to fund a substantial portion of the U.S. restructuring costs from our overfunded pension.
Before providing an outlook, let me quickly touch on some other items, starting with cash. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was about even with last year with lower operating earnings, offset by lower working capital usage. Our cash balance declined in the quarter, largely due to the combination of a seasonally low sales period for the company and our inventory build for the peak selling periods across many of our packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. As we move through the remainder of the year, we expect cash flow from operations to turn positive and to grow our cash position.
Our cash balance also reflects planned investments we're making to complete large productivity enhancement projects, including the new biomass boiler for the Covington mill. CapEx in the quarter was $114 million, which is down from last year's level of $149 million and primarily reflects reduced spending on the Brazilian business expansion. Our outlook for CapEx in 2013 continues to be $475 million to $525 million, with the $50 million range representing more discretionary growth capital that will deploy opportunistically depending on market developments.
Now turning to the outlook. While we expect earnings in the second quarter to be below the year-ago quarter, we continue to expect to show renewed earnings growth beginning in the second half of 2013 and solid improvement for the full year. Looking at the second quarter, we are expecting to build on our first quarter volume momentum in key packaging and Specialty Chemicals products lines. In addition, the price mix trajectory is expected to improve as we realize price increases in our Industrial business in Brazil and as we continue to successfully implement announced price increases for key paperboard grades and recoup resin pricing through contractual escalators.
Input cost inflation is expected to moderate further from the first quarter. The main drivers of our expected second quarter earnings decline versus the previous year are the major cold outage at the Covington mill that Jim referenced and lower land sales compared to last year, which included a large tract sale.
Looking into the second half and full year 2013, we expect our manufacturing businesses to benefit from volume growth and price and mix improvement. These benefits, along with a step change in earnings performance from the Brazil expansion and gains from both our portfolio actions and cost initiatives, will drive strong earnings improvement in the back half of the year. John?
John A. Luke
Thanks, Mark. To sum up, we've described the principal macro and operating challenges that impacted our results in the first quarter as well as the underlying progress we're making with our strategy. We're very focused on improving our results and achieving our longer-term goals, and we're doing so by continuing to execute on our profitable growth strategies and by implementing a series of actions that we've had underway and announced today, including reducing overhead costs, exiting folding carton operations for beauty and personal care and advancing further toward opportunities to unlock value from our Land Management business. We remain confident in our strategic direction, and we're moving forward in this direction with renewed determination.
This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We'd now like to turn to you for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
First, one kind of modeling question. The cold outage at Covington, how much roughly might that cost the second quarter? And also, are we talking about $10 million, $15 million less in land sales versus year ago? Or can you bracket that for us?
John A. Luke
Mark, I'll turn it to Jim to comment on that.
James A. Buzzard
Yes, sure, Mark. The -- our estimate right now is the cold outage, the incremental cost this quarter versus a year ago, in a range of $11 million to $12 million.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
And on the land sales?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Mark, I think right now, based on our forecast, we had a big tract sale there last year. It's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Reduction?
E. Mark Rajkowski
That's correct.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay, great. And then can you share with us any thoughts on a time line as you evaluate the Land Management business?
John A. Luke
Yes, Mark, I'll take that. It's premature to spec out a defined time line as we're in the early stages of the process. We've done a lot of work over the last several months with our advisors and our internal team, and we're very enthusiastic about the potentials. But it would be premature to put a line in the sand that would commit us to a time line. Again, our goal is to move as swiftly as we can with the overriding objective of maximizing the value of the overall holdings with specific focus on the discrete mix that we have of forestland, mineral -- lands with mineral rights and the development properties.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Would it be fair to say it's certainly well within the realm of possible or even probable that there would likely be some specific action taken this calendar year?
John A. Luke
Oh, I think that, that would be reasonable to expect. Again, I wouldn't want to go on record promising that, but certainly that is within the clear realm of our hopes and expectations.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Following up on the land. As you think about the opportunity here on the portfolio, you've done a lot of portfolio moves over time, C&OP and others back in the day. So I guess some of those you've used the cash you've gotten from that to buy back stock. More recently, C&OP used it to kind of invest in the Brazil project. So how would you think about uses of any cash that you might get and how much you might return to shareholders given where you are with the balance sheet, et cetera?
John A. Luke
Mark, do you want to take that up with Phil?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes. I think job one is to look at unlocking the value, maximizing value for the shareholders, certainly. Remember, the amount of cash will certainly be a function of the structure of the transaction as well. But I think it's fair to say that historically, as you've pointed out, we've been fairly balanced in terms of looking at how we deploy our capital. And certainly, as we get to that point where that's a nice problem to have, obviously we'll be looking at all of those options, including returning value to shareholders.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then on Industrial, it sounds like we're kind of behind the investment phase here. So as we look at the second half of this year, is it reasonable to expect that the Industrial business could start run rating at a 20% EBIT margin?
James A. Buzzard
Phil, I think that as we -- as you move through the back half of this year, we will continue to see gains in that business. We're making progress as we speak. We're not satisfied, candidly. I think we need to do more, and the team is focused on that. Certainly, the expectation you've identified is where we anticipate being over time, and that's our expectation. We'll get there at some point. I don't want to make -- name a day specific at this point, obviously.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And just one last question on the SBS business, the price declines there. Now obviously, some of your competitors have already started to see those price declines towards the back half of last year. You didn't really see it until the first quarter. So I guess it sounds like it was a little bit unanticipated, if I read you correctly. Is that the case? Or were some of this contractual flow-through of things that happened last year? How should we think about that? And then with respect to the timing of getting the price increases, it sounds like some of your peers indicated some of this is contractual through 2014 and less in '13. So just maybe walk through some of those dynamics.
James A. Buzzard
Sure, I would say that the price declines were more around what you described as contractual. As you said, we held up much better through 2012 than the general market would have suggested. But we did have contract resets, some of which are tied to published indexes that occurred in the beginning of 2013. But those are annual contracts, and so we would expect, as we come out of it this year into 2014 on our contract business, to reset that. On our noncontract business, we're out in the markets talking with customers, moving prices. And while it's too early to comment on what our success rate is going to be, we're seeing some positive momentum right now in the -- in our price moves. We would expect to see gains throughout the quarter and as we enter the back half of 2013.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And how much is contract versus noncontract?
James A. Buzzard
On the SBS side, I would say it's probably in the 45%, plus or minus, range is noncontract.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
So as you think about what you're seeing with consumer products companies, you mentioned some of your new food packaging rollouts, but we're starting to see food packaging companies retrenching a little bit and maybe pushing back some plans. Is that affecting your expectations for your rollout of new packaging this year? Should we assume that, that's going to slow down?
James A. Buzzard
Sorry. Go ahead, John.
John A. Luke
Yes, Mark, let me start, and then I'll turn it to Jim. I think that there's no question that there is a general sense of, if not retrenching, everyone is trying to understand what the consumers' priorities are going to be here and around the world. We have with the high-quality board, high-performing board and the sustainability features that are inherently a part of our marketplace offering, seeing sustained and continued interest in what we're offering. And if you marry that up with a number of innovations that we're bringing to the fore, we're finding that there's a good deal of interest that is continuing to mount. But the underlying premise of your question, which is that everything that we're reading would suggest that there is uncertainty about consumer preferences, is in the backdrop. But our momentum is strong, and we have every reason to believe that it will continue. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Not a lot to add to that. I think that John is exactly right. The overlying trends in the markets are as described, but the value propositions that we have, whether it's using carton board to replace corrugated, as I mentioned, whether it's the lightweighting and the requisite sustainability benefits that, that provide, those are providing a lot of opportunities for us in the marketplace, and that's really been the source of our growth to date.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
Okay. And just one more question. With respect to cold weather, in a business like beverages, when you get cold weather, that business is sort of lost semi-permanently. But in Specialty Chemicals, with paving activity, I would assume that you can recoup most of that. Can you run us through the business if it were affected by the cold weather and where they fall on that equation of where it's lost forever and where it's recoupable?
James A. Buzzard
I think the big ones you've identified. So in terms of beverage, I think that is exactly right. If somebody's not going to consume because of cold weather, they're not going to double up later on. Having said that, I think one of the things we are seeing and hearing is that many of our customers are going to increase their promotional activity. So we may get some benefit as a result of some additional spending there. And on the asphalt business, clearly it was slow coming through the end of the first quarter. We do expect to be able to recoup that. There's a link to the season that they can double up, and there's a certain amount of spending that they will do, and we'll recoup that. Home and garden would be another one that the cold weather would delay. Again, we're -- how much of that is lost, we're not sure. We're seeing nicer activity at retail, and that's driving some improvements in Q2. But we'll have to wait and see what the end result of that is. But those would be really the 3 segments that have been impacted.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Going back to the consumer board market, a few companies have discussed seeing a real improvement in backlogs. I'm just wondering if you could discuss what you're seeing and maybe give some perspective in light of the commentary about kind of retrenchment that's supporting the pricing activity in the market currently.
John A. Luke
Sure. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Gail, yes, we -- we're seeing good improvement in our backlogs as we came throughout Q1. We're now looking at about 4 to 5 weeks' backlog, and some machines, candidly, we're even stronger than that. And that has built through the quarter and certainly sustained itself through the beginning of the second quarter. I think part of it is a reflection of the fact that at the end of last year, people drove their inventories down. So from a supply chain move, clearly an impact with the closure of the machine that was announced earlier this year. And so all that, I think, has resulted in stronger backlogs. And certainly, the fact that we're shipping around the world, as I noted in my comments, some of the strength we're seeing in places like Asia for the beverage business are helping drive our volumes as well.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And can you give a little more color on the folding carton beauty business that you're backing away from? You referenced they're losing money in the first quarter. Can you maybe quantify that or at least discuss? Is that a trend that you've seen? Has it been kind of a general drag on results? And also, does it consume much? Or can you quantify how much of your board those businesses consume?
John A. Luke
Yes, Gail, let me start and then turn to Mark and Jim to comment a little bit more. I think this is a business that we've worked very hard to shore up over time. It has been a business that's been under increasing competitive pressure, and I think the circumstances in Europe and even a growing market like Brazil have demonstrated these characteristics. And I think as we've seen the amount of time, focus as well as the drag on overall earnings that has resulted from this performance, we've made the decision going into this quarter to make the move we've announced today.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Gail, I would add that we have seen a pretty consistent trend over the last number of quarters. We lost money in the fourth quarter of last year. We lost money again in the current quarter. And as John said, as we look at focusing our activities on the most profitable parts of our business, it's clearly was something that was the right thing to do.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
And again, just one last question. Going back to the targets that you've put out at the end of 2011, clearly the bottom line hasn't progressed as you expected. I mean, do you still believe that type of EBITDA growth is achievable within the time frame that you set out? Or would you kind of think that perhaps it's gotten pushed out another year or 2?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Gail, certainly we've seen our fair share of headwinds in terms of some of the softness in the global economy. Currency has not been our friend for sure, particularly in Brazil. But while we've gotten off to a little bit of a slow start here in 2013, we've said all along that a significant portion of our earnings improvement was going to be in the second half of this year. It was going to be a function of the investments that we've made to expand in Brazil, productivity improvements in our mills, bolt-on acquisitions that we've done. And as we highlighted in the release today, we're taking additional actions to improve our margins, both in terms of the exit of our folding carton operations for beauty and personal care in Europe and Brazil as well as another $75 million of overhead cost reduction. So those things -- despite a clearly difficult backdrop, those actions and certainly the expectation in terms of the earnings improvements we'll see in those investments we made give us certainly confidence that we can get there.

And our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
First question on productivity. Can you share with us what your full year productivity target is for the year? I think you've averaged about $125 million over the last 3 years.
James A. Buzzard
Our target would be above that number in 2013 driven a lot by the gains we expect to see with the Industrial project down in Brazil. And so we would hope to be well north of that.
John A. Luke
And I would add also, Ghansham, in productivity, we include SG&A and overhead costs, right? So we'll see a benefit from some of those savings in the second half of the year as well.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And then on the beverage volumes, down 5%. I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give us a split in terms of Europe versus the U.S.?
James A. Buzzard
I don't have the exact split. Europe was worse than North America, and so they were probably reasonably close together. But I don't have the exact breakdown in front of me.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And then finally on land, obviously this is a big portfolio to take down for one single entity. So should we sort of expect multiple transactions or tranches, if you will, as you kind of progress through this process of monetizing this portfolio?
John A. Luke
Ghansham, it's John. Fair question there. I think it would be our ideal to find a single transaction with the conditions that we have outlined with respect to the Charleston development properties, and a clear answer -- and driving emphasis on achieving good tax efficiency. We recognized that, that ideal outcome, despite what we expect to be a transaction with a broad base of interest, may be difficult to achieve given the mix of holdings that we have in that broader portfolio. And so we're recognizing that there may well be more than a single transaction at play, and we'll know more as we move through the next several weeks.

And our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I'd like to return to kind of the industrial packaging business. And just curious if you can give us some sense of what you think the performance road forward looks like there. If we go back, in '11, you did $20 million in the first quarter. You did $19 million last year. And this year, you did $11 million, and that's after almost $0.5 billion of investment there, plus the addition of Ruby Macons. So if you could just help us think about how performance should ramp up over the next kind of 4 to 6 quarters, I think that'd be helpful.
John A. Luke
We'd be happy to do so. Jim, you want to take that?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Mark. I think as you described, certainly we have seen things ramp down from where they have been. A large part of that's driven around, as we've talked, ramping up the new machine. And so we're in that process. I think the other part that's been impacting us is clearly, we've seen inflation in Brazil, and we've not been able to move box prices commensurate with that as we have. And that doesn't always go particularly in sync. And so oftentimes, inflation gets out ahead of box price increase. I think the things that we're seeing now is we're moving box prices. We had some moves in Q1 that are in place. We've just announced a second increase that we are, in fact, implementing. So we're starting to get box pricing back where it needs to be. Clearly, around the expansion project, it had been more than just the machine. So we've been phasing in a new fiber line, a new line kiln. And each of those has an impact on the overall productivity of the mill. We will soon have that behind us, so we'll begin to see that ramping up. Clearly, there have been some impacts of currency over time as well. Having said all of that, I think we clearly see a vision that says we'll get back to that 20% operating rate that we're -- we would expect and then move beyond that. So there's nothing about the project where it is today and what we're doing that suggest that the long-term objectives we laid out are not certainly achievable. We have great confidence we'll do that.
John A. Luke
Yes, and I just would punctuate that last point, Mark, by saying that we are restless with the timing, but we are very enthusiastic about the overall potential for this project. And I know you had an opportunity to visit there over the last couple of months and saw firsthand the great work that is underway.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes, I mean, essentially, you've rebuilt that mill. So just calling it a kind of a machine addition kind of understates the difficulty. I'm also curious in Brazil. I just -- I looked at Klabin's results the other day, and their EBITDA margin is up at like 36%. I know there are some differences between you and Klabin in terms of land base, but is that ever a number you could see Rigesa moving toward?
James A. Buzzard
I think historically, we've been in that 30% range, maybe slightly lower than that. But I think we certainly would have that as an aspiration we want to move to. As you noted, their mix of business is a little bit different than ours, their land base is somewhat different than ours. But certainly, laying out the targets we've set on -- 20-plus percent on operating margins and getting to 30-plus percent is something we certainly want to expect that we can get to.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And Jim, if I can come for just a minute to kind of food and beverage again to kind of draw a little bit of a comparison. Your biggest competitor in that market was out last week with earnings, and their margins are about 500 basis points above yours. And I just -- I understand kind of the -- some of the mill issues, but is there any reason that kind of your margins shouldn't be pretty similar to their margins in this business?
James A. Buzzard
I think over time, there's no reason that we should not get our margins back up there. As you noted, we were impacted fairly significantly by the mill outages. We've had -- and again you have to look at SBS, which is part of that, and CNK. So in the SBS business, we've not seen pricing move up commensurate with the inflation. We're beginning to make that move now. But certainly, as you look at the broader context there, there's no reason that we can't get our margins back up where they've been historically and in line with those targets.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And finally, just any thoughts on kind of ramp forward in Specialty Chemicals?
James A. Buzzard
I think Q1 was a tough quarter for us. It was some of the transitory things. We've talked around the asphalt markets, clearly some of the outage issues that we faced that won't hit us in the second quarter. So we would expect our Q2 to be in line with what the record levels were a year ago and then continue to move from there. Clearly, I think the historical year-over-year gains that we've demonstrated given the place that we're operating out of today are -- we're not going to see those kind of year-over-year gains. But we -- certainly, with the investments we have made with Resitec, some of the investments we're making in terms of growth in emerging markets, we would continue to expect to see improved performance year-over-year.

And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with BoA Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I wanted to hit a couple of questions first on the board business. You had mentioned, I think, that you're seeing some signs of increasing promotional activity from your customers related to beverage. I wanted to confirm if that was the case. Then if you can share any details around that, that would be helpful. And the related question in board, can you provide a bit more color or granularity in terms of what happened in terms of that temporary customer loss? I think you said it was related to specifications. What was behind that? And why is it now temporary? And then I had a couple questions on costs.
James A. Buzzard
Sure, George. Maybe I'll start with the first 2. In terms of the beverage business and the promotional activity, those are things that we expect to see. So I think those will be manifest in terms of maybe some pricing actions to help move volumes. Beginning to see a little bit of that, but I think we would expect to see that later in the second quarter. As we move into the third quarter, it's where that will begin to really ramp up.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Jim, is that a seasonal comment? Or you're seeing an improvement versus a year ago from what your customers are saying?
James A. Buzzard
I think what our customer are saying is that we'll see more promotional activity in 2013 than we might have seen in 2012. Again, those are comments we're getting. We'll have to wait and see how that actually plays out in the marketplace.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. Understood.
James A. Buzzard
And in terms of the customer loss, I don't want to go into a lot more specifics there, obviously, but other than to say that we have developed a product now that meets and exceeds the expectations of our customer. We're in extensive trials as we speak, and we expect to recoup that business as we go through 2013.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. Will you be at the recouped level in 2Q? Or you really don't get there until later on in the year?
James A. Buzzard
It'll be later on in the year, I'm sure. As I've said, we've got trials that are going on now, and we'll have to work our way through that. So certainly, it'll be a Q3, Q4.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Understood. We appreciate the detail on the cost reductions that are coming and the goal that you laid out. If you could prepare -- or provide a little bit more detail in terms of how that cost reduction target was developed. As I look at -- I think you mentioned in your release or in your material your SG&A-to-sales ratio is still 12%. If you get all of that to the bottom line, that's only about 1% off your SG&A-to-sales ratio, and that's still a relatively high ratio versus peer companies, other wood and paper and forest or packaging. So why is that the right number? Why could there not be more spending? And I had one follow-up to that, and then I'll turn it over.
E. Mark Rajkowski
George, so the -- really the focus was on really identifying areas of costs that are really not essentially driving our growth agenda, and we continuously review those. Certainly, we have invested a fair amount over the last several years, and we've kind of taken a step back and looked to reset, get more focused. And as we do that, we're doing that in the businesses, we're doing that in our functions, support organizations, and that is not the end of the work. We're going to continuously look to be more efficient to drive costs out. But certainly, at this point in time, we think this is a pretty good step forward. And the other part of this is, as you look at SG&A, is driving the top line and getting the yield out of these investments that we're making, which we're pretty confident that we're going to be able to do. So it's more than just the cost side. I think we're making some pretty good strides in getting that right-sized. And we also expect to see some pressure downward on that margin as a percentage of sales also from higher top line growth.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Would it be fair to say we'll see a little bit less growth spending? If we go back to your packaging day in December of, I guess, 2011, obviously there was a lot of focus on growth. And whether Specialty Chemicals or packaging, certainly Industrial, you've been investing behind growth, yet the growth hasn't necessarily been where you wanted it to be. So realizing that there have been some headwinds, should we expect that maybe MeadWestvaco is going to be spending a little bit less on growth and more trying to get a yield off of the investment that you've already made?
John A. Luke
Thanks, George. Let me just comment and invite Jim or Mark to chime in. I think that we will, consistent with Mark's point, continue to look for ways to take cost out of the system. We will continue to invest in growth. We will do it as we see the opportunities, and we see significant opportunities out there. And I think that the last thing we want to do at this stage of the game is severely inhibit our investment in important market facing markets for the profitable growth-generating initiatives.

And our final question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
First question is on Ruby Macons. I'm not sure when -- this is a small one, but when that deal closed, and you mentioned it added $20 million in revenue for the quarter, is that a little bit less than the normal quarterly run rate? Or is that a good number to go with?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Chip, it's Mark. The -- that closed at the end of last year, really late in the year, beginning of December, I think. And I think at this point, that's a representative level of sales. And clearly, as we continue to work with the team there, we're looking to drive volumes up. Certainly, the market continues to grow very well, and we're looking at ramping up capacity to meet market needs there.
Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC
Got you. And then just as a follow-up, when you look at the land business overall, obviously there's a very different unique of -- a unique set of opportunities in the East Edisto-Charleston area. But as you look at the remaining lands, I seem to recall that most of those lands don't have a lot of really development value but are more recreational. And -- but also, maybe some of them also have strategic fiber, contain strategic fiber for the company. So is it likely that we would see that those lands probably sell for something near or maybe a little above their timber value because of the recreational content? And secondly, would you likely have some supply arrangements assuming that you still have some strategic need for the timber off those lands?
John A. Luke
Chip, let me again start on this one. I think you've raised a key point of consideration. As we move through the transaction, broad transaction, we're contemplating it's all about maximizing value and not sacrificing the inherent value of any recreational-related land. So that's very much at the fore. Second, absolutely we will be looking for fiber supply agreements. That's going to be an important condition of any transaction we put together.
