Welcome to the Tyco Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. (Operator instructions). Todayâs conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Director of Investor Relations; you may begin.
Antonella Franzen 
Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining our conference call to discuss Tycoâs third quarter results for fiscal year 2010 and the press release issued earlier this morning.
With me today are Tycoâs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen, our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Coughlin as well as Naren Gursahaney, President of ADT Worldwide.
Let me remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release is issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Now let me quickly recap this quarterâs results. Revenue in the quarter are 4.3 billion was up 3% year-over-year with flat organic revenue. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.50 per share and included $0.22 per share related to special items. Before special items, earnings per share was $0.72 compared to our guidance of $0.60 to $0.62 per share. The $0.72 per share compares to the midpoint of our guidance of $0.61. The $0.11 difference consisted primarily of $0.7 of better operating results, $0.10 attributable to a lower tax rate offset by a net fixed end charge for a legal reserve and a benefit from certain pension plan changes.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed Breen for some opening comments. Ed will be followed by Naren who will discuss our ADT business and then Chris will review the results from our other businesses before we wrap up and take your questions.
Edward Breen 
Thanks Antonella and good morning everyone. Overall, this was a good quarter for Tyco. From an operational perspective, we saw sequential improvement in revenue and operating margin across all business segments. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Broadview Security and are well underway with the integration process and are very excited about the opportunities of joining the best of both ADT and Broadview.
From a capital perspective, we invested more to strengthen our businesses and returned excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me start off with a few overall comments. First, the majority of our segments, including the service side of our fire business grew revenue organically year-over-year. The systems installation and service side of our ADT business turned positive after 6 consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline.
Operating margins improved both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by our close management efforts and a continued growth of our recurring revenue and service activities. Additionally, increased volume in our product and manufacturing businesses also contributed to the operating marginâs improvement. From an orders perspective, itâs important to keep in mind that our service and recurring revenue businesses have been growing and represent 40% of our total revenue. Orders for the remaining 60% of our portfolio, which is our product and systems installation revenue grew 5% year-over-year on a global basis with order growth and flow control, fire and safety products.
Second, our free cash flow generation continues to be strong and provides us with the financial flexibility to fund our organic growth investment activities, make selective acquisitions and return excess cash to our shareholders.
As we indicated last quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and to date, weâve purchased 15.8 million shares for $575 million. We expect to continue repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter and will likely utilize the remaining 325 million authorization under the program by our fiscal yearend. Now let me make a few quick comments or two about each of our businesses and then Naren and Chris will provide you with more details in a few minutes.
Starting with ADT, our recurring revenue continued to perform well with 4% organic revenue growth. Excluding Broadview, our account base and [indiscernible] both increased and our disconnect rate continued to improve. Additionally, the systems installation business has stabilized. Growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions and improving conditions in North America offset the continued softness in Europe. We also saw continued improvement in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year. Growth in our higher margin recurring revenue business, coupled with the benefits of restructuring activities and cost actions as well as improved productivity and mix in our systems installation business contributed nicely to the operating margin improvement.
Turning to flow control, performance in the quarter was as expected. Sequential improvement in revenue and operating income and continued growth and order activity. The announced divestiture of our waterworks business in Europe is another step in focusing our portfolio on industries and products that we can leverage on a global basis. This business, which sells to markets in Europe makes products such as hydrants, fittings, couplings and valves primarily for the transmission and distribution of water for residential use. Our intention is to grow our flow control business with global products and services that utilize advanced technology and critical applications.
Next, our fire business had operating margin improvement both sequentially and year-over-year despite the continued pressure on the top line. More importantly, the quarter marked a turning point to positive order activity and backlog continued to grow.
Next, the continued investments we have made in our safety products business to fund our growth plans and maintain our R&D sales and marketing spin throughout the economic downturn are starting to pay off. We are well positioned for a recovery and have seen the benefit of increased volume in our operating margin which improved 350 basis points year-over-year.
And finally, electric or metal products performed a bit better than expected in the quarter due to improved pricing for both steel and copper products. The previously announce tax re-spin of this business to our shareholders continues to move forward and we are tracking to complete the separation within the first half of our fiscal year of 2011.
Overall, we saw improving conditions across all our businesses in the quarter. The top line stabilized, operating margins increased and order activity improved. Additionally, we made good progress focusing our portfolio around our 3 core platforms of security, fire and flow control.
Now, let me turn the call over to Naran to review our performance in ADT and provide you with an update on the Broadview integration process.
Naren K. Gursahaney 
Thanks, Ed and good morning everyone. ADT continued to show good progress against all of our key financial and operating metrics. Revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion with organic revenue growth for the first time in several quarters growing at 3%. Recurring revenue continued to grow nicely at 4%, driven by our North America residential and small business operations. We also continued to see nice recurring revenue growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Systems installation and service revenue grew slightly on our organic basis, up almost half a percent. While we still saw declines in North America and EMEA, the decline grew very large compared to what weâve seen in the past. These declines were offset by 17% organic revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Before special items, operating income was $275 million and the operating margin was 15.1%. Excluding the impact of Broadview, and a $12 million benefit from the quarter related to certain pension plan changes, the operating income before special items was $271 million and the operating margin was 15.3%, a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year. While a portion of this improvement is a result of our improved business mix with more of the higher margin recurring revenue, we are also reaping the benefits of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives including our operation of excellence initiatives.
We also saw continued progress in improving customer attention, with a 30 basis point improvement in our attrition rate to 12.8%. Our accounts phase now stands at over 8.8 million recurring customers, including the addition of the Broadview account base of 1.4 million customers. Excluding Broadview, we grew our account base by 3% and our average revenue per user grew 1% to $45.72 excluding the impact of foreign currency, which is consistent with what weâve seen over the past several quarters.
As Broadviewâs customer base was nearly 100% residential compared to ADTâs mix of residential and commercial customers, the new blended overall decreased by 4% to $43.42 per account. In terms of regional performance, we continue to see solid performance in our North America residential business where units and upward growth were consistent with what weâve seen over the past several quarters.
Although the commercial side of our North America business remains soft, we are seeing increased activities in certain vertical markets like retail. Despite the 3% decline in organic revenue, our operating margin improved 110 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of our restructuring and cost containment actions more than offset the revenue head wind.
In EMEA, we continue to see strong margin improvement in both the UK and Continental Europe. The operating margin before special items of 12.1% increased 820 basis points year-over-year and 560 basis points on a quarter sequential basis. These results included a $12 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes which contributed 300 basis points to the margin improvement. With these trends, we continue to feel good about achieving our 10% target by the end of 2011.
In the rest of the world, which include several of our key emerging markets, we are seeing solid top and bottom line growth. Growth was 10% for recurring revenue, plus systems installation and service revenue growth was in the mid to high teens. We continue to invest in emerging markets and remain excited by the opportunities we see there.
Much of our focus during the third quarter was on the closing of the Broadview acquisition and the initial stages of integration of this business into our North America residential and small business platform. As you are aware, we closed the deal in the middle of May so our results include about 6 weeks of Broadview this quarter. Broadviewâs impact on the quarter was an operating loss of $8 million, primarily driven by the purchase accounting impact of the transaction that we mentioned when we announced the deal.
As we move forward, it will become more difficult to call our Broadviewâs results separately as we are fully integrating the business into our ADT residential and small business platform. Weâve adapted the best of both approach to integration and are committed to leveraging the best people, processes and technology from both organizations as we build our new ADT North America residential business.
John Koch, whoâs been leading our ADT North America business for the past 4 years will lead this combined business. John has assembled a leadership team that includes several key leaders from those ADT and Broadview. We are very pleased with the progress weâve made so far in our integration approach, and we remain confident that weâll deliver on the synergy and accretion expectations that we stated when we announced the deal.
On a fiscal year basis, we expect the impact to be neutral in fiscal 2010 and accretive by about $0.10 in fiscal 2011. Decrease in estimates include the impact of non cash purchase accounting charges. Looking at this on a cash basis, the fiscal 2011 accretion is actually $0.18 per share. Much of our current efforts are focused on the marketing side. As we prepare to migrate away from the Broadview and consolidate all of our lead generation to the ADT brand, we expect to finalize this transition during the fourth quarter.
Weâve also begun to train our sales teams on the standards of our product offerings and are moving forward to integrate our field teams into a common management structure. In addition, weâve focused considerable time and effort on communications with both our customers and our employees. While weâre still early in the process, the response from customers appear to be favorable with both businesses showing modest improvements in retention on a quarter sequential basis.
Finally, I thought Iâd comment on the roll out of our new interactive services platform, ADT Pulse. As we indicated in the past, we launched our operational pilots during the third quarter and are currently offering these solutions in 5 test markets across the country. These are operational pilots focused on developing our capabilities to sell, install and service the new solutions which combine light safety with life style.
The initial customer response has been positive with no marketing and advertising support. We are also seeing a nice pickup in our installation fees and our [indiscernible]. We are currently ramping up our training efforts and expect to expand from our current pilot approach to a full market by market national roll out later this calendar year. I look forward to updating you on our progress with ADT Pulse during future calls.
Before I turn it over to Chris, let me provide you with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to approximate $1.9 billion with an operating margin before special items of approximately 16%.
Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Coughlin 
Thanks, Naren and good morning everyone. Iâll start with flow control. As Ed mentioned, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our waterworks business in Europe for approximately $245 million. The transaction is expected to close in our fourth quarter, and is now reported in discontinued operations. On an annual basis, this business generates about $350 million of revenue with an operating margin in the high single digits.
Approximately one penny per share in the quarter, an estimated $0.5 per share for the year has moved to discontinued operations. During the quarter, flow control had revenue of $849 million which again excludes the revenue from our European Waterworks business. Organic revenue declined 7% as the 11% growth in water and the 16% growth in thermal control were more than offset by a 17% decline in the valves business. As expected the organic revenue decline has moderated. The 7% decline this quarter compares to a 14% decline in the first quarter and a 13% decline in the second quarter. Before special items operating income was $119 million and the operating margin was 14%. Despite the volume de-leveraging, the operating margin performance in the quarter was similar to last year due to increased activity in our pacific water business, related to the Australian desalinization project.
Additionally the operating margin continued to benefit from our cross management and restructuring activities. For the second consecutive quarter, we have seen year over year growth in orders which is encouraging. Excluding currency, orders grew 4% year over year. It is important to keep in mind that there is a 6 to 9 month order to revenue conversion cycle and flow. So the recent order activity we are seeing will most likely impact our fiscal to year 2011. Backlog of $1.5 billion declined 3% on a quarter sequential basis, again excluding the impact of foreign currency; primarily driven by the shipments of products for the Australian desalinization project.
As we look to the fourth quarter, we expected continued improvement in organic revenue with a year over year organic revenue decline in the mid single digits. While our revenue will grow sequentially, product mix in the quarter is expected to result in an operating margin before special items of approximately 13%. Turning now to our Fire business, revenue in the quarter was $822 million and the organic revenue declined 6%. Service revenue grew 2% organically, offset by continued weakness in system installation which declined 13% organically. Our strategy to be more selective in our project work has contributed to the organic revenue decline. However, the benefit of this discipline can be seen in our improved earnings and operating margin performance.
Before special items, operating income was $85 million and the operating margin was 10.3%. Operating results were positively impacted by $7 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes which improved the operating margin by 80 basis points. The remaining improvement in operating margin of 110 basis points resulted from the benefits of our restructuring actions, cost containment activities and the selectivity in project work which more than offset to revenue decline. We expect operating income before special items in the forth quarter to approximate the third quarter level, excluding that pension benefit.
Year over year orders turned positively growing 4%, again excluding the impact of foreign currency. Backlog of $1.2 billion increased 5% on a quarter sequential basis excluding the impact of foreign currency. Moving down to safety products, revenue grew 5% in the quarter to $389 million with an organic revenue growth of 6.5%. The revenue growth was driven by strong performance in electronics security which grew 15% organically and life safety which grew 14% organically. Organic revenue was flat in fire suppression after five quarters of double digit organic decline. Before special items operating income was $65 million and operating margin improved 350 basis points to 16.7%.
Higher revenue and better proactively coupled with savings from our restructuring actions and close containment activities more than offset our continued investment in sales, marketing and R&D. On a year over year basis we expect organic revenue growth to be similar to the third quarter with an operating margin of approximately 16%. Lastly, electrical and metal products had revenue of $390 million with an organic revenue growth of 15%. Year over year revenue growth was primarily due to higher selling prices for both steel and copper products. Although demand has stabilized, volume remains at historically low levels.
Despite the continued low volume, the operating income before special items of $41 million was better than expected and represents a significant improvement over the prior years operating loss of $6 million. The $47 million increase in operating income is primarily due to better steel spreads. Looking to the fourth quarter we have seen steel prices weaken in recent weeks after increasing sharply the first half of the calendar year. Based on current market dynamics we expect revenue of $375 million and operating income of approximately $30 million. So before I turn back the call over to Ed let me touch on a few other important items.
As you have just heard, certain of our defined benefit plans were converted to define contribution plans resulting in a $22 million benefit in the quarter which has been reported in our business segment results. Next we perform a number of actuarial evaluations during the second half of the year to determine if there are any liability reserves which need adjustments. As a result we increased the legal reserve by $52 million which is reported in corporate expense. Including this charge, corporate expense before special items in the quarter was $142 million.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect corporate expense to be approximately $115 million bringing our full year corporate expense to about $450 million. Turning to interest expense; we issued $5500 million of bonds at a very attractive interest rate. Additionally we redeemed approximately $870 million of outstanding bonds resulting in an $87 million charge in the quarter which again is included in special items. Next, our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 6%, well below the rate we guided to last quarter. We had expected our annual tax rate to be in the 17-18% range and now believe our tax rate for the full year will be in the range of 15-16%. This improvement reflects the impact of our tax planning activities as well as the Broadview acquisition.
As we have discussed in the past, the timing of the impact of tax items can move the rate significantly quarter to quarter. We expect the fourth quarter tax rate to approximate 23%. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter and expect our average share count to be about $500 million in the fourth quarter, as it will include the full impact of the shares issue for the Broadview acquisition. I also want to touch for a minute on restructuring. To date we have incurred approximately $60 million of restructuring charges excluding Broadview; compared to our estimate of approximately $150 million for the year.
Our original estimate includes a cost to significantly restructure or shut down certain small operating units. We are now more confident that we will be able to sell certain of these operations which could therefore reduce our restructuring costs by $40-50 million. This would result in full year restructuring charges of approximately $100 million. A majority of these actions we have taken over the last two years are permanent in nature and will not result in increased costs as business conditions continue to improve. In addition we incurred restructuring and acquisition charges of $37 million in the quarter related to the Broadview transaction.
We continue to expect these charges will approximate $100 million of which a large majority will be incurred in the first 6 months of the acquisition. Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morningâs call.
Edward Breen
Thanks Chris. Overall Iâm quite pleased with our performance so far this year. As I previously mentioned, we have continued to actively manage our portfolio. The Broadview acquisition has increased the return revenue portion of our portfolio. And we have taken several steps in divesting businesses that do not align with our global strategy. Overall the actions we have taken this year have further strengthened our core platforms. Second our teams around the world have continued to respond quickly to the continued challenging economic environment. We have managed our cost position well, restructured certain operations and maintained key investments that position our businesses for future growth and continued margin expansion.
Lastly, our already strong balance sheet position has been further strengthened by our refinancing of debt and reduced tax rate. Now letâs turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect that the trends we saw this quarter to continue. We expect fourth quarter revenue of approximately $4.4 billion. The overall operating margin in the forth quarter should slightly improve from the 10.4% we achieved in the third quarter. Our debt restructuring should decrease our interest expense by approximately $5 million sequentially and as Chris explained our tax rate will approximate 23% I the fourth quarter. We therefore expect our EPS before special items in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.64.
Last quarter we indicated that we expected EPS to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.58 for the full year including approximately $0.05 of EPS from our European Waterworks business. As this business is now reported in discontinued operations, our full year guidance range would be $2.45 to $2.53 per share. Based on our fourth quarter guidance, we now expect the EPS from continuing operations before special items to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.58 which again excludes the $0.05 of earnings from our Waterworks business. Therefore our revised guidance of $2.56 to $2.58 is a $0.06 to $0.10 per share increase from our previous guidance. And with that operator letâs open up the lines for any questions.
Question-and-Answer session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator instructions). Our first question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners; your line is now open.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
Thanks and good morning.
Edward Breen
Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
I had a couple of specific questions for Naren but just also to maybe start on the guidance. The revenue outlook for Q4, what are you assuming for kind of the underlying growth or lack thereof in Broadview?
Naren Gursahaney
I think we are expecting kind of consistent growth with what weâve seen for the past couple quarters, but the one cautionary piece there Jeff is during from the time we announced to the time we closed, we did see a decline in the number of sales reps they add as there was a little bit of a challenge replacing sales reps because of the uncertainty. We are now ramping that back up on the ADT side and the Broadview side and look to get that up. But other than that, I donât expect any significant changes to the kind of growth weâve been seeing with them.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah, Jeff I will remind you that as we get in to the fourth quarter itâs going be difficult if not impossible to break out sort of Broadview revenue verses the normal ADT revenue as weâve combined all our marketing programs and the brand. So weâll just be reporting on ADT revenue. And we will highlight obviously the residential small business piece of that.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
Okay and then Naren just more specifically as you think about these things together and kind of the notion of the best of both, probably in broad terms, the best on the ADT side is subscriber acquisition cost and its attrition on the Broadview side. And I just wonder what your initial thoughts are now as you have 6 or 8 weeks into this where those two can meet and how you would target those going forward.
Naren Gursahaney
Well again Jeff we are still very early in the integrations. Hesitant to draw any conclusions at this time but based on what weâve seen and what we expected to see was a very good from a customer service perspective, we found some interesting technologies that they have used to serve customers better, and actually reduced the cost to serve on the service side so not just on the attrition side. Clearly theyâre very selective upfront on the account acquisition side. We still believe that we will get the subscriber acquisition down closer to where ADT was over time and then attrition rates again for the combined business we expect to continue take those down in the same kind of progress we have seen over the past Iâd say year excluding the impact of the economy.
Edward Breen 
And Jeff I thought it was nice that you know we had a lot of questions around where you have disconnect because itâs now going under -- Broadview is going under ADT. You can tell by the disconnect rate; the ADT disconnect rate improved sequentially but so did Broadview and I think thatâs a real key indicator so kind of an answer to that question because weâve had a fair amount of communication already with the Broadview customer base. So they are well aware of whatâs taking place and to see how the attrition rate declined, I thought it was a good sign.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
Then Naren, I was wondering if you could also just comment then again acknowledging itâs probably early, but your initial thoughts on [indiscernible] and what the subscriber acquisition cost looks like for interactive once you kind of include the higher sale I guess that would happen at the time of the interactive?
Naren Gursahaney
Jeff, the one caution on this one is we have not really started the advertising campaign to support this so whatever units we are getting are basically up sales at the kitchen table at this stage. From a pricing perspective, weâve targeted depending on which of our 3 offerings they pursue anywhere from a ten to a $15 increase in ARPU for those specific products dependant on the 10 to 12 range because we expect the mix to be more towards the lower end. The product offering there seems to be holding well but again we are very early in that rollout right now just in those 5 test markets. And the subscriber acquisition cost is higher but debts are being offset by the higher install dollars that we get upfront. So from a net perspective, we are not seeing a significant change there.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
Edward, Chris I will just jump on one last one here. Can you give us some early thoughts on some of the high level items for 2011? The product stuff moving around tax rate Broadview coming in Lorraine gave us a number. We got to think about attempts been -- just what are your over etching thoughts on how to frame 2011?
Edward Breen 
Yeah I will maybe let Chris jump in maybe on corporate and tax in a moment but -- and I think Jeff just mentioned a couple of this here but ADT because of Broadview coming in will add $0.10 to earnings next year. So that a tail win on an EPS basis.
You need to take about $0.20 out for electrical and metal because we are assuming the spin happens towards the beginning of the year so that would come out of that number and I would say maybe just one other point is -- flow, because we are starting to see the orders improving. By the way, they did continue to improve during the month of July. But when you look at the backlog how itâs going in this conversion cycle we are talking about, I think youâll see a nicely stronger second half of next year for flow. But probably still a little bit muted during the first half of the year till this increased order activity kicks on a shipment basis. Chris you might want to --
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah, I think if you look at our corporate expense for example I do expect that weâll be able to reduce that again slightly from where we have been this year. On the tax front, itâs still very early to determine what kind of tax position weâll have. Obviously weâve done a terrific job since the separation in reducing that tax rate and as weâve indicated, Broadview will be a positive. Weâve got taxing authorities around the world looking at their tax policies right now. So I think between that and obviously what ends up been our geographic mix of revenues and profits could impact that but again, weâve done a good job in holding and I donât think anything dramatic there. And then weâll obviously have the impacts of the share repurchase as we continue to reduce our share count and offset some of that impact of the Broadview acquisition and then obviously the refinancing that we have just completed will reduce our interest expense as well.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners
Aright, thank you.
Christopher Coughlin
Thanks Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Inch with Merrill Lynch; your line is now open.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
Thank you, good morning everyone. Neran or either Chris, did you take up the Broadview accretion expectation? I know that you had said $0.07 on the first fiscal year. How does that dovetail with kind of a couple quarters or a quarter and a half of ownership in fiscal 10 versus fiscal 11 and are we still on track for the, I mean if you patch this all to gather what does that imply for fiscal â12, second year of ownership, et cetera?
Naren Gursahaney
John I think itâs consistent with what we talked about when we announced the deal. The only difference is we talked about first 12 months and second 12 months and now we are just kind of calendarizing it around our fiscal year, so no change at all.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
So the $0.10 Neran, if you go back to the way you had originally laid this out first 12 months, second 12 months. How that roll through to fiscal 12 does, is that like a $0.15 accretion number or is it a little bit higher?
Naren Gursahaney
Yeah I would say itâs in that range. When we talked originally we said $0.07 for the first 12 months and $0.14 for the second 12 months. I think you are in the range.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
OK and then what exactly were purchase accounting charges â not restructuring charges but purchase accounting charges for Broadview in the quarter and then Iâm just trying to understand, is your guidance going forward going to be including Broadview restructuring charges as part of the integration or are you excluding those? Itâs not really clear.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah, let me take that John. First in 2010 in the guidance that we have provided the restructuring and acquisition cost related to the transaction we have excluded from the guidance. The impact of the purchase accounting which includes adjustments to the deferred revenue base as well as a subscriber asset base which needs to be amortized, those are operating costs that we have included in our guidance for the year.
So there are a lot of adjustments that happened and some pretty complicated purchase accounting adjustments which generated this $8 million loss for the quarter. Again that is for a six week kind of time period but the normal operating margin that we saw as a stand alone were essentially the margins that we achieved in the quarter. So no real change there, itâs just a noise from the purchase accounting. So I hope that clarifies it.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
Chris, from the $0.72 operations versus the $0.50 gap, how much of that was Broadview associated charges?
Christopher Coughlin
There were $37 million of what Iâd call onetime restructuring charges and acquisition costs. That was going from the 72 down to the 50 but then included in the $0.72 is an $8 million loss from Broadview which is as the result of having to write off things like the deferred revenue balance and writing off some of the subscriber base and additional amortization.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
Okay, I think that makes sense. Just curious on the temp spin, perhaps this is a question for Ed. Have you thought towards prospectively selling this business changed? And Iâm just trying to think out loud as clearly Iâm assuming people have perhaps expressed an interest in the business since you announced the spin. What are your thoughts towards a spin versus a sale at this point?
Edward Breen
John we are still down the road of clearly going towards the spin. Weâve heard some rumblings out there that there might be some interest in the business but nothing definitive. My gut is weâll know that answer over the next 60 to 75 days and if we did get an offer clearly we will assess that and see what the best avenue is for our shareholders, but my thinking at this point clearly is we are headed down the spin route.
Naren Gursahaney
Yeah John, I would also add, we obviously talked about this business since the separation and what the dramatic impact that the economy has had on that business and their competitors, the strategic what you would think of as strategic buyers are in very poor financial position actually, this is a much better shape than any others. So that also impacts that decision.
John Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch
Yeah, that makes sense. Ok hanks very much
Naren Gursahaney
Thanks John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Yeah thanks, good morning. Obviously there is a quite a big gap between Broadviewâs ARPU and your residential legacy ADT, residential ARPU. Can you maybe talk about some of the strategies that you have to maybe get up â to improve the Broadview ARPU closer towards your legacy?
Christopher Coughlin
Just to clarify Nigel, when you look at just at our residential business against Broadview business the gap is not significant. When you look at our total ARPU, it gets distorted a little bit because of the commercial side of our business. That says there is a small gap between the 2 and itâs really driven more by the content of what they were selling. They had a very simplified package that they were offering and as we look to add more sensors, more devices there, there is an opportunity to take up that ARPU over time and again as we bring the sales force together and standardize the product offerings for that combined sales force there should be a little bit of a pick up there.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Ok and then can you maybe just quantify what the impact of Broadview with the purchase accounting charges, what the impact was on ADT margins during the quarter and maybe then secondly on top that, you expectation for the contribution in 4Q within your guidance.
Antonella Franzen
Nigel if you take a look at ADT and you kind of adjust because we also had â remember the pension benefit in the quarter of about 12 million and you also adjust for the impact of Broadview, if you do an apples and apples to ADT how we have previously reported, the margin was about 15.3%.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
But that includes Broadview?
Antonella Franzen
No, when you exclude Broadview. If you exclude Broadview OI was around 271 million and the OI margin was 15.3.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay great and the contribution in 4Q, within the EBIT number?
Antonella Franzen
For overall we gave a total revenue number and a total OI number and as Neran and Chris had mentioned before, as we move forward it becomes more and more difficult to completely separate Broadview from the total as again everything is going to be integrated as we move into the fourth quarter.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay.
Christopher Coughlin
But it will be positive. What happens though, again try to explain the revenue impact, we lose about $10 million a quarter because of the deferred revenue which is written off and we have 13 to $14 million of additional amortization each quarter. But again once we get into this quarter all the revenue was combined so thatâs why we are just going to give the overall perspective of ADT.
Antonella Franzen
And one other thing that I would like to add is, as we said before is the transaction in total was a little bit diluted to our earnings in this quarter and is a little bit accretive for the next quarter so for the full year we are neutral.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay and then as you move towards full roll out of Pulse in the next 12 months, I mean is that going to be a material drag to ADT margins?
Christopher Coughlin
I wouldnât expect it to be a drag.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay and then just finally on the European EMEA margins within ADT. I think you called out a 3 points impact from the pension from these margins.
Christopher Coughlin
It was 12.1 including that pension benefit if you back that out it was a 9.1 for the quarter.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
And I think you mentioned there is a 2 point benefit from the France disposal.
Christopher Coughlin
Little less than that.
Antonella Franzen
Yeah year-over-year France contributed about contributed about 140 basis points to the market improvements.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay, so on a comparable basis we are sort of in the high sevens on EMEA margins?
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah, fair since the last with France said, yes.
Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank
Okay, thatâs pretty good. Okay thanks guys.
Christopher Coughlin
Thanks Nigel.

Our next question is from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Good morning. Just first question on the waterworks European disposal divestiture. You mentioned that itâs been a high single digits today. What were the margins at peak? Iâm just trying to work through the multiples if you go back in time.
Christopher Coughlin
About high single digits, as I pointed out thatâs why I went through, itâs more couplings fittings products like that, itâs not our highly engineered type products Steve. So strategically that was one of the reasons. Itâs a nice business for someone else to own but for us strategically itâs more on the lower end of what we were doing and didnât play to our global platform strategy. So thatâs about what it was, itâs running right now about as well as it was. Itâs about 8 times Ebitda.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Right, so you are saying the margins are pretty consistent despite the volume changes over time.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Just broadly speaking then, how do you think about your overall TYCO European business strategy developing? What does TYCO look like in Europe as you work your way through all these divestitures now?
Edward Breen
As Chris mentioned our restructuring speed is going to go down because we now look like weâre going to be able to sell some, what Iâll call smaller non-strategic operations and just a ball park view, weâre talking now weâre down to kind maybe 100 to 120 million of revenue with very marginal bottom line performance. So thatâs kind of the ball park of what weâre talking and itâs both a little bit on the Fire side and a little bit on the security side then weâll be pretty much done with Iâd say that program.
Steve what I feel good about is weâve got â weâre getting much better discipline around our lead process, what weâre going after, what weâre not going after, the verticals we want, the verticals we donât want. So we are as Chris mentioned, weâre purposely even â but more on the Fire than ADT side but both sides of the business, weâre purposely reducing our organic revenue growth a little bit on purpose because weâre not going after some verticals and we are clearly though seeing the benefit of that in the bottom line margin performance of the business.
So as Naren said if I look at it with the divestitures weâve done, with the restructuring and the selectivity of bidding, weâve got the margin this quarter at 9.1% on a true run rate basis on the ADT side and you can see very nice margin improvement occurring on the international Fire side which is really for the same reason.
So I think weâre â in the next Iâd say two quarters or so I would say we are clicking about where we want to be with the portfolio and it wonât change from there.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Ok and Chris maybe you could talk about little more detail on that $52 million legal reserve. You mentioned the liabilities and just maybe give us a little more color there.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah, sure Steve. As we do every year we perform our annual analysis of asbestos related liabilities and the related insurance assets that we have which we did this quarter and we do that, we base on our claims experience that goes back over the last 5 years and then we look out over the next 7 and then so as we completed that analysis this quarter we decided that we should increase that reserve by the $52 million and again that charge is included in corporate expense. So again this is more of a one-time catch up.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Have you seen a material change on the Asbestos side that is providing â driving some of that fulfillment?
Christopher Coughlin
A material trade right now going forward obviously there are a lot of variables that go in that in terms of claims which go up in certain periods, go down in other periods. So we may face like $10 million kind of a headwind going in on our annual expense, not on the $52 million. So thatâs sort of what we see right now.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Okay and on the non-GAAP tax rate, the 6% number, is that all â is that mostly a result on the acquisition side or is there something else going on there?
Christopher Coughlin
There are some other tax planning activities that we had planned on completing this year but again itâs difficult to pin the exact timing. So it was included in our guidance, actually came out a little bit better than our guidance. But it was that â the full impact of that plus the Broadview acquisition that drove it down. So again I think as you look at our results quarter to quarter, the way to really look at each quarter is just use the annual tax rate of 15 to 16%.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Okay and then just the last question on capital allocation. Youâve been taking about sort of an acquisition on the order of a few hundred million dollars around that as previously. Are you still thinking about that? You want to give us a sense for that given your comments on share repurchases etc?
Edward Breen
Yeah Steve I think we havenât changed our thinking. We are looking at some acquisition stuff that could be up to $500 million and one weâre looking at, who knows if weâll get over the finish line, it will be a couple of 100 million. So itâs that type range, I can say right down the middle of the plate and either Fire, Flow or Security.
But even with that when we model out our capital plan going forward, weâre in a nice position to still have excess cash. Weâre funding all our internal capital; weâre funding all our growth initiatives. So weâve been very comfortable, you can see from what weâve previously guided through last quarter, we did significantly more share re-purchase during the quarter and if we do the $325 million more here in the fourth quarter, we will have done $900 million in about 4 and a half months.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Okay and acquisitions of the size youâre talking about, you would not be talking about additional share issuance, right, in those deals?
Edward Breen
Most likely not.
Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.
Okay great, thanks guys.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah thanks Steve.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
Hi, good morning.
Christopher Coughlin
Good morning Steve.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
Just starting on flow, the orders were up I guess 4% but you talked about them being up double digit in April and May. Is there a tougher compare in June or what happened in June, because then you said July has actually remained pretty good.
Edward Breen
Yeah Steve, look itâs a very lumpy business. We actually thought a couple of big orders would hit in June, it did not but we ended up pretty flat in June. So the aggregate for the â so youâre correct, we were up higher in April and May, kind of down flat in June and therefore we ended up at 4.3% for the quarter.
I did feel pretty good that we had about the same result here in July which we just preliminarily rolled up yesterday so that feels good. But I guess what Iâve been watching because it is lumpy and one or two big orders can really sway, Iâm looking at the lead flow that our sales team is working on and it feels very robust right now and there is a couple big what I call elephant deals that I donât know when theyâre going to float but I have a high confidence that weâre going to get a couple of these.
So again the flow of it feels good coming in with the sales team and not to talk about competition per se but I have noticed a few other flow control companies also saying that their sales activity this quarter just feels pretty robust and theyâre feeling good. So Iâm not declaring victory that weâve turned the corner but itâs two quarters in a row now of organic growth and if you go back, fiscal â09 this business was â orders were down over 20%, as was the competitors that report, in the first quarter we improved that to down 13% and now weâre second and third quarter and July now positive with good lead generation.
So I think it bodes well kind of for the second half of next fiscal year.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
So turning to next year, you talked about the second half being better. Do you grow next year or is it kind of like the first half is down as much as the second half is up?
Edward Breen
No, weâll grow next year.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
Okay and then as far as fire protection is concerned, I kind of understand the sequential dynamics there but looking back at last yearâs fourth quarter, very strong, almost $100 million in OP and I know last year you talked about positive seasonality there in the services business, youâre talking about a much lower number in the fourth quarter of this year, whatâs going on there? Was there something unusually strong about last year?
Christopher Coughlin
Steve again our fire business similar actually to our flow business is a much later cycle business and what we saw at the end of last year was a work off of the backlog during that period. So then the order intake started to decline. So it was really that impact that we saw similar to what we saw in flow.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then lastly you talked about corporate expense being down in â11 from â10. That excludes the charge, correct?
Christopher Coughlin
Yes.
Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co
Okay thanks a lot.
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah thanks Steve.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
So another question on Broadview, a couple of questions. What were the operating contributions in the quarter, sales and profit margin?
Naren Gursahaney
On a GAP basis Bob?
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Well, what were the sales â it looks like the margins were pretty high when you take out the one time items you just define maybe just give us explicitly. Looks like the margins were north of 20% ex the items. Just want to go back at that.
Naren Gursahaney
Yeah I mean as I said generally speaking again, taking out the deferred revenue piece kind of apples to apples to the way theyâve reported in the past. They were in the 60 to 65 million dollars of revenue and in the low 20s from an operating profit perspective.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Right, now how would the $10 million and the $13 million in one time charges evolve in the fourth quarter into next year?
Christopher Coughlin
Yeah again those were not necessarily one time charges. They were the impact of purchase accounting but again as I indicated we have about $10 million a quarter in revenue that Broadview would have recorded because they would have had the deferred revenue on their books which we do not and then the increased amortization. So I guess itâs about $65 million on an annual basis that goes evenly by quarter. But thatâs in all of our numbers that weâve given you, so when we gave you the fourth quarter guidance those charges are in there.
Antonella Franzen
And theyâre also in the accretion numbers that Naren spoke to.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Yeah, that was my next questionâ¦
Christopher Coughlin
I think thatâs why the cash accretion is so much bigger when you look at this economically. The cash accretion is so much bigger than the accounting because of the increased amortization.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Got that but it is possible on this call to give us an updated walk to the $0.10 of accretion revenues, profits and the various charges, how do you get to the $0.10 even though I understand youâre integrating the business or you would you say that, but how do you get the $0.10?
Christopher Coughlin
Again I think â I canât run through all the numbers with you right now but again if you look at the annualized revenue that Broadview had less some of the deferred revenue charges, add that to $65 million, add back the shares and take out then the tax impact which is about 2% on overall tax rate. You do all that math and it comes out to about a $0.10 on the first year basis.
Naren Gursahaney
Bob, for us the synergies I donât think are going to be that hard to track, weâve got a very detailed schedule because we didnât count on revenue synergies per se and the dealers you know, we didnât count on ARPU going up, with some of these questions weâre getting. Itâs all cost actions and tax, the two full percentage points on the type of tax line is $50 million and the other part is all cost actions that weâre tracking against headcount moves, consolidation of facilities that we can actually count the hard dollars on the cost side against.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Okay, weâll be watching for that.
Christopher Coughlin
And again none of these have changed since all the numbers that we gave at the time of the acquisition. So we are spot-on on track with the synergies and with all the accounting and tax assumptions.
Robert Cornell - Barclays Capital
Okay thanks.
Christopher Coughlin
Thanks Rob.
Antonella Franzen
Operator we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC
Yeah thank you. You mentioned the strong orders that flow in July and the pipeline being still pretty strong. Just a follow up, are these opportunities likely to convert kind of to sales in the same time? Is this typical or are you seeing lead times stretch or are you just generally seeing any backlog stretch at Flow or at Fire?
Edward Breen
No weâre not. Again the conversion time in Flow is kind of 6 to 9 months and by the way when weâre looking at backlog weâre talking about 12 month backlog by the way when you hear it in our numbers when we talk about it. So I donât know thereâs nothing stretching out at this point in time there and that would be true on the Fire side. The only caveat that I would give you , Iâve heard some other companies worrying about this is from a production standpoint on some of our panels and all we have had some shortages on components that weâre really scrambling around on, but at the end of the day it didnât impact us that significantly. But that would be my only point about lead times pushing out, components suppliers are tight and weâre really managing that closely.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC
Okay just one last follow up, in the past I think youâve mentioned some pricing pressure on the sprinkler side of the Fire business, now that orders at least appear to be showing some life, are you seeing any firming of those prices?
Edward Breen
Not on the sprinkler side, we continued this quarter to see a softness there. Let me clarify though where we make the majority of our money in Fire which is the service side and our Fire panel electronic business we have not seen margin deterioration, but the margins on the sprinkler business which in all of Tyco is the one place we did see it that has not improved yet.
Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC
Got it, thank you guys.
Edward Breen
Great, thank you Gautam.
Antonella Franzen
Operator, that concludes our call.
Operator.
Thank you. This does conclude todayâs conference, thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.
