Good day. My name is Savannah and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation First quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakerâs remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead.
Lara Mahoney
Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO, and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022, to report Nordson's Fiscal 2022, First Quarter results. You can find both our press release, as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www. Nordson. com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days.
There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Wednesday, March 2nd. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call maybe forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. these statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ.
Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss first quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe will also discuss the cash flow and balance sheet. Naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance, as well as our updated fiscal 2022 second quarter and full-year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's Fiscal 2022 First Quarter Conference Call. As we expected, the demand environment that we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021 flowed into the first quarter. Our teams did an outstanding job delivering for our customers. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit sales growth across most end markets in meet of supply chain constraints and labor shortages. I'm very thankful for our employees for staying safe, managing dynamic market conditions, deploying the NBS next growth framework, and ensuring we meet the needs of our customers. I'll speak more about the business in few moments. But first I will turn the call over to Joe to provide detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
Joseph Kelley
Thank you, Naga and good morning to everyone. On slide number 5, you'll see First quarter 2022 sales were $609 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year's First quarter sales of $527 million. The increase was primarily related to 16% organic volume growth and 4% from the NDC acquisition. Offset by headwinds from currencies and the screws and barrels product line divestiture. This double-digit organic sales increase was driven by solid growth in most product lines with particularly strong demand in electronics, industrial, and medical end markets. Geographically, all regions delivered organic growth in the quarter.
 Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $340 million. Excluding the amortization of acquired inventory step-up, gross profit totaled $342 million or 56% of sales. In the quarter, compared to $290 million or 55% of sales in the prior year first quarter. This 100 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by improved sales mix from the divested screw and barrels product line, sales volume leverage, and process enhancements from our NBS next growth framework. On a year-over-year basis, inflation pressures contributed to a negative price cost mismatch, unfavorably impacting margins by 100 basis points.
 As price realization is delayed, given the extensive backlog entering the year. This impact will continue to lessen as we move into the second quarter and the back half of 2022. On a sequential basis, comparing Q1 2022 to Q4 2021. Gross margins improved approximately a 100 basis points as several of the non-recurring items experienced in Q4, 2021 did not repeat as forecasted. We continue to take appropriate pricing actions in FY2022 to respond to inflationary pressures. Our organization's agility and disciplined approach to cost control coupled with consistent deployment of the ascend strategy is allowing us to successfully navigate these challenges and continue to deliver profitable growth.
Operating profit in the quarter was $156 million, adjusting for the purchase price accounting related to inventory amortization, operating profit was a $157 million or 26% of sales. A 44% increase from the prior year. Double-digit organic growth, favorable sales mix, and continued cost control measures contributed to incremental operating profit margins of 59% in the quarter. EBITDA for the first quarter was $183 million or 30% of sales. Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $1 million or 21% from the prior year, driven by reduced debt levels.
Other net expense decreased $6 million from the prior year first quarter. 3 million of the decrease is attributable to fluctuations in currency, gains, and losses as the prior year, first quarter included a $2.8 million currency loss. The remainder of the decrease primarily relates to reduced pension expense, attributable to the increased funding in the prior year. Tax expense was $32 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with our prior year rate and the forecasted full-year rate for 2022. Net income in the quarter totaled a $120 million or $2.05 per share.
Adjusted earnings per share excluding inventory amortization, totaled $2.07 per share, a 57% increase from the prior year. This improvement is reflective of the strong double-digit year-over-year increase in sales and more importantly, consistent application of the NBS next growth framework which leads to steady profitable growth with attractive incremental margins. Now, let's turn to Slide 6 and 7 to review the first quarter 2022 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $324 million increased 12% compared to the prior year first quarter.
Organic volume growth in the quarter was 12% plus another 8% from the NDC acquisition. This was offset by the divestiture impact and unfavorable currency of 3%. Different than previously communicated, the NDC acquisition is now being managed within the IPS segments rather than Advanced Technology Solutions. As we've integrated this business over the past three months, it's become clear that NDC has greater alignment with our IPS end markets and sales channels.
We believe this is an optimal fit to harness future growth. IPS was strong, 12% organic growth delivered in this quarter was driven by robust demand for industrial coating product lines. Plus, steady growth in the consumer, non-durable end markets for hot melt adhesive dispensing drove this quarter's results. From a geographic perspective, growth was strongest in Asia and Europe. Operating profit for the quarter was $104 million or 32% of sales. Which is an increase of 24% compared to the prior year operating profit of $83 million, excluding the acquisition and the divested product line for comparability purposes, operating profit grew 15% over the prior year.
For an organic only incremental profit margin of 51%. Moving now to Advanced Technology Solutions. Sales of $285 million increased 20% compared to the prior year first quarter. This change included an increase in organic sales volume of 21% offset by a 1% unfavorable currency impact. Growth was across all major product lines, but particularly strong in product lines serving electronics, end markets, which grew approximately 40% over the prior year. Medical product lines were also strong, growing double-digits, and product lines serving broader industrial markets grew in the high single-digits.
All geographies contributed to this quarter's growth with particular strength in the international regions. First quarter operating profit was $76 million or 27% of sales. The 62% increase over the prior-year operating profit of $47 million was driven by sales volume leverage, and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020 and early 2021. This segment has now been performing at the mid-20s in terms of profitability for the last four consecutive quarters.
Deployment of our NBS next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment, delivering profitable growth. Finally, turning to the cash flow and balance sheet on Slide 8, free cash flow in the quarter was $106 million or a conversion rate on net income of 88%. As strategic investments are being made in inventory to address portions of the current supply chain constraints. During the first quarter, we acquired NDC for a $172 million and paid $30 million in dividends and spent 35 million and share repurchases. Through our disciplined approach to capital deployment and strong operating profit growth. We ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet and abundant borrowing capacity.
Cash totaled a $171 million and net debt was $637 million resulting in a 0.8 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we anticipate successfully annuitizing a portion of our pension liability associates with retirees in payment status. This will have no impact on cash flow in the year. As our domestic pension plan is well funded, but will likely trigger a non-cash, non-operating charge depending on the terms of the final annuitization transaction. For modeling purposes in fiscal 2022, assume an effective tax rate of 21% in capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million. I will now turn the call back to Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Thank you, Joe. Let's turn to Slide 9. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance. I spent a lot of time in our facilities this quarter and I am impressed with our caliber of talent and the dedication of our employees to meet commitments for our customers despite the constraints of the supply chain and labor availability. During my trips, our divisions demonstrated how the ongoing deployment of the NBS Next growth framework is helping them identify best products and customers and then prioritize capacity to meet the demand of these customers.
For example, our medical fluid components division, which had over 40% sales growth driven by its focus on biopharma applications has dedicated injection molding machines to more efficiently meet the needs of their best medical device customers. Joe and I also visited our electronics processing solutions division in California where we saw the new Vantage product in action. The Vantage is our first fully integrated [Indiscernible] handling system designed for the semiconductor industry. At a time when the demand for semiconductors is growing at an incredible pace.
We are meeting the needs of our customers with a product that advances automation, reduces cost, and accelerates productivity for our customers. Before I turn to guidance, I'd like to share an organizational update. I'm pleased to share with you that Jeff Penn Brook, Executive Vice President and segment leader for advanced Technology Solutions, will be assuming the segment leadership role for Industrial Precision Solutions effective March 1st. Jeff began his career in our industrial coatings and adhesives businesses. So he interest this role with a strong understanding and appreciation of excellent position of the IPS divisions and leaders in their end markets.
He will build upon that by empowering and accelerating the progress of our NBS next growth framework in IPS. I will assume leadership of our ATS segment while we evaluate long-term plan. We are fortunate to have strong division leaders throughout the company, and I look forward to working more closely with that. Now, let's turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slides 10 and 11. Order entry remained strong throughout the first quarter with the favorable book-to-bill ratio growing backlog to over $900 million. This growth in backlog is related to the ongoing extended shipment request from our large customer orders from electronics, industrial, and medical end markets. In this strong demand environment, we expect supply chain and labor availability to remain as constraints into the second half of this year.
Based on these factors, we expect FY2022 second quarter sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 10% as compared to FY2021 second quarter, with adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. This guidance means that our teams will deliver the fourth consecutive quarter of around or above $600 million in revenue despite our capacity constraints. This is a great credit to our winning teams and their commitment to our customers. Based on the strong performance of the first quarter, we are focusing our full-year 2022 guidance on the high end of the range that we provided in December.
We now expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 7% to 10% and adjusted earnings per diluted share growth in the range of 14% to 18% over fiscal 2021. This growth is over a record fiscal 2021. Our financial results and expectations for growth reflect our differentiated precision technologies, customer - centric model and diversified end markets. Additionally, our leadership team is advancing the implementation of the Ascend strategy, which is establishing NBS Next as our growth framework and entrepreneurial organization and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable, profitable growth. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders, and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison Poliniak
Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the comments around that price cost spread. Is there any color you can give us in terms of how you think on cadence, is it sequentially improved or it becomes more favorable in the back half for you? just trying to understand the context of that.
Joseph Kelley
Yes. Thank you, Allison. Excuse me. So, yes. When you think about our price increases and the realization in Q1, given the strong backlog, it didn't have a huge impact in terms of the top line in Q1. That will improve. So if you think about a 100 basis point negative in Q1, I think that will probably cut in half as you go into Q2 and then it should be neutral by the time you get into the back half.
Allison Poliniak
Great. And then with the supply chains, labor shortages. Just -- I know you said you built some inventory to help smooth that to some extent. One, within the backlog. Do you see -- are you able to look at that from a long-term perspective? And is that getting better for you? Is it easing somewhat underneath those, I know it's still constrained, but are you getting a little bit more visibility on that sort of the labor and supply challenges that are currently out there?
Sundaram Nagarajan
Allison, let me take that. If you think about our supply chain constraints, these are not across all of our businesses. I think you want to -- those are in particular businesses. Many of them related to electronic components. In some businesses, there are some casting issues, but we do see those supply chain issues continued to get better as we progress along the year. In terms of labor shortages, I would tell you, we certainly had an issue related to the Omicron Variant here in the first quarter. That certainly has improved. But in general, I think about it, we're going to -- our forecast is we're going to ship pretty close to $636 million and a $40 million dollars in the second quarter. And that is now four quarters worth of four quarters of over $600 million in revenue. So the constraints are at an elevated level is probably the way I would put it.
Allison Poliniak
Now there's one last question for me, just in the backlog piece of it. I know your customers are probably facing similar issues. Are you getting any push outs of some of that acceptance or those product projects or is it been manageable?
Sundaram Nagarajan
Yeah. No, it has been manageable. What they have -- pretty much many of our customers are planning for it. And hence, what you're beginning to see, as we have indicated in the past, that our orders are being -- request shipment dates are extending out more than we normally see. I think people are ordering ahead of time, anticipating not only problems with their own supply chain, but hedging their bets with us as well.
Allison Poliniak
Great. Thanks, I'll pass it along.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.
Mike Halloran
Hey, good morning, everyone.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Morning Mike.
Joseph Kelley
Morning Mike.
Mike Halloran
So just want to follow up on that last comment there, Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Sure.
Mike Halloran
So when you think about the backlog, when do you think it gets to more normalized levels or when you think about your guidance, do you get to more normalized level by year-end? And obviously the customer patterns are shifting a little bit and how they're managing their orders, I'm guessing at some point that goes back to normal and that will be in conjunction with supply chain normalizing. But any thoughts you have on how you're thinking about that and what's embedded in guidance would be great.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Let me have Joe take the part on guidance, then maybe I'll start us off with -- in general what we're seeing is, until supply chain normalizes, this thing is going to keep going back and forth a little bit, right? And I think our expectations on supply chain easing is probably more towards the second half, maybe end of the year. And that's really what we think. Unless that changes faster, I think our guidance sort of takes into account that assumption. Joe, you want to add any more color to that?
Joseph Kelley
Yeah. I mean, when you think about the backlog, Mike, it is different. What I'd tell you these large systems businesses, 75% of our backlog today as tied to these businesses which have large system orders. And those orders are booking out until 2023 in many of those businesses. When you look at our what I will call our normal book and ship type businesses, which includes parts and consumables, hasn't closed the large systems. Should say, parts and systems that I would tell you that order entry and we look at that and the backlog, that kind of supports our guidance as we look out and see the growth rate in Q2 and the back half, whereas the backlog is inflated to a high level because of those large systems businesses which are booking way out into 2023. So the composition of the backlog has changed. And when we look at the normal book and ship business, it does support our growth guidance for the back half.
Mike Halloran
So Joe, it sounds like you're saying that from a backlog perspective, there's no color excess backlog catch-up embedded in the forward guidance. It's just kind of how you're sliding out some of those larger systems. It's projects and kind of a normal cadence on the non-systems businesses. Is that fair?
Joseph Kelley
That is fair.
Mike Halloran
And then on the capital allocation side, how are you thinking about capital usage at this point in as opposed to things one. Interest in buybacks at this point. And then secondarily, what does the MNA funnel look like? And from an actionability perspective,
Sundaram Nagarajan
Maybe I'll take the acquisition first, Mike and then Joe can cover the rest of the pieces that you have interest in. On the acquisition base, we remain active, the pipeline is healthy, but we remain disciplined. I think that's really important for us is that we are focused on scaling our medical business, focused on expanding our T&I capability. Certainly add any other adjacent position technologies if the right thing comes along. So lots of activity, healthy pipeline, but remain disciplined. All right. So we want to remain strategically disciplined and financially disciplined. And so over the long haul, we are confident we will deliver on the $500 million in acquisitions that we committed to at our Investor Day. Joe, you want to.
Joseph Kelley
And the remaining capital allocation in terms of dividends and share buybacks. You know, we increased our dividend last year trying to target a yield closer to 1%. And on the share buyback over the longer period, we tried to offset dilution and so just systematically buying back in the marketplace to offset dilution, given the run in the stock price, we were unsuccessful in doing that last year. And so we're working on that this year. We did buy back under the 10B51. 140 thousand shares approximately here in Q1, but I would tell you, Mike, our strategy there has not changed. It's simply to offset dilution.
Mike Halloran
Great. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time.
Operator
Next question is, from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mitchell Moore
This is Michel Moore on for Jeff, just quickly on the NDC Technologies acquisition. I know you guys touched on it a bit in the prepared remarks, but I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the decision to include NDC Technologies and IPS and maybe what specific opportunities you saw that maybe weren't apparent when you first acquired NDC? Thanks.
Joseph Kelley
Yeah. I think as we spend a little bit more -- first and foremost, the NDC acquisition is coming along very nicely. Three months into -- in our portfolio. We really like the team, really like the product technologies, like the customer exposure and end market exposures they have. And so, really spending more deeper dive into the businesses and really thinking through what are the best growth opportunities for the business and what are the end markets that they are most excited about? You get some view of it during diligence, but it is a pretty accelerated process so after spending more time with it we fundamentally believe, think about the film exclusion business that they have, they have gauges for that or think about the food and consumer type end markets where they have IR technologies to measure the quality of the food. We felt that this end market exposure lines very well with our packaging businesses.
And hence, the growth opportunities and the ability to cover the customer. In many ways, sometimes if we go to a, let's say, a consumer goods manufacturing line or to what we end up finding is that at the back-end, when the food is package, you find our release hot melt adhesive systems in the front end when you are looking for measuring the freshness or the quality of the food that's getting manufactured. You definitely find a lot of NDC. So, this exposure on consumer industries, we felt that there is a great alignment between both these sales channels and hence, we decided to move that business into IPS.
Okay. Great, that's very helpful. And just on medical, I think you guys called out biopharma as a particularly positive, I just wanted to dig in on that a bit. I was just wondering how elective surgeries have trended given the recent spike in COVID, maybe if more people been delaying surgery is and whether you feel that's led to some pent-up demand here that you might be able to capitalize on.
Mitchell Moore
Thanks.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Yeah. What we find, elective surgeries are continuing to recover. If you remember in this particular surge, the hospital capacity was not that strained as it was during Delta. So we continue to see elective surgeries come back up. So we see our interventional component businesses continuing to do fairly well, but if you think about the biopharma business, it's slightly different. In that, we sell a lot of components to people who manufacture biopharmaceuticals. And that business is very strong for us. It's not only just vaccine production, but it is also gene and cell therapies that are very -- and in addition, you also have biopharmaceuticals expanding capacity to make sure that are more regional availability of vaccine, I meant therapy.
Mitchell Moore
Okay. Great, I'll pass it along. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Matt Summerville with Davidson. Your line is open.
Matt Summerville
Thanks. Just with respect to looking at the business geographically, volume in the U.S. and Japan only up modestly year-on-year. Maybe just talk a little about that. Is that more comparison-related? Is there something, anything to read into with respect to what you're seeing there geographically?
Sundaram Nagarajan
If you think about the geography is what, what we find is that you're certainly right, that we saw at significant strength in Europe and Asia, those were particularly high points for us. Japan is still recovering. Japan got hit hard with COVID. I think the Americas is moderate around comps. So if you think about it, Americas came out first for us. Regionally, we don't see anything significant other than, I would say we had a broad-based growth in the quarter and that's our expectation with particular strength in Asia and Europe.
Matt Summerville
With respect to the HTS business, and if I think about this, kind of multiyear capacitization cycle that we have begun to see, and will see, as it pertains to the semiconductor industry, when would you expect Nordson to see peak benefit from that capacity cycle there?
Sundaram Nagarajan
Yeah. I mean, the capacity cycle continues to change and remain dynamic, but I would tell you, we are seeing significant activity. That's what you see in the ATS business. The growth in ATS was primarily driven by electronics and biopharma, but what you're seeing is some pretty robust demand right now. Is that the peak? Matt, I would -- it'd be very difficult for me to sort of gauge that. This is an -- as you noted, it's an extended cycle. More extended than we have seen before. Is this the peak? I don't know. But are we working with our customers right now?
Yes. There is a lot of activity and our solutions. So think about Vantage, which is the wafer handling system with our dispense systems, is one of the best products that is helping our customers accelerate their units per hour with great quality. That has gone well for us at the same time, we also have [Indiscernible] thousand, which is our test and inspection that goes into semiconductor wafer inspection data is doing incredibly well. I look at both those businesses. I'd tell you the market activity and the demand is pretty strong. I don't know whether I would characterize it as it is peak right now or peak for another few years, I don't know that it's difficult to guess. But as you know, we have a direct sales model that allows us and gives us visibility to what our customer activities are much more than others in the industry who go through distribution.
Matt Summerville
Got it. Thanks, Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Thank you, Matt.
Operator
Your next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Your line is open.
Andrew Buscaglia
Hey, good morning, guys.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Good morning Andrew.
Joseph Kelley
Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia
I wanted to ask. So your commentary just around supply chain, kind of, easing somewhat or not getting much worse. And that -- commentary is definitely a bit makes this earning season across companies. But I guess, what exactly are you seeing where you -- where you feel like things are maybe now easing up a bit?
Sundaram Nagarajan
If you take couple of different pieces of it, it is not getting worse, right? So I can definitely tell you that. Is it getting better in some parts it's getting better. Freight is not as much as an issue it was before. It is getting better. Electronics components, most of it is fine, but there are few areas that's still -- it's not so much, it doesnât get what you are looking for. You just don't get as much as you want. It's maybe the way to describe those supply chain issue. It's not like, oh, I don't have that component. It's like I don't have if I have X. I couldn't give you two Ms. So that's what we're dealing with right now. It's not -- early in the cycle we were looking for substitution, things like that. But now it is more about how much more can we get and that is really what is governing our capacity to work the backlog down.
Andrew Buscaglia
Okay. Yeah. You said freight, are the margin are better like in terms of pricing?
Sundaram Nagarajan
Yes.
Andrew Buscaglia
Interesting.
Sundaram Nagarajan
It does not significantly have done
Andrew Buscaglia
What other [Indiscernible] on any further either. So sorry.
Joseph Kelley
The other supply base had some labor constraint issues in select cases. And so that should hopefully moderate as the COVID situation improves. Okay.
Andrew Buscaglia
Okay. And just one other question on -- your ATS margins were a lot stronger than I was expecting. I might have missed this, but how much was mix of factor there? And then, I guess just generally, what's driving that and the sustainability of margins there?
Joseph Kelley
Yes. So in ATS, I mean, running that 53% gross margins are relatively in line with where we've been running for I would say the last three quarters. And what you see there is the benefit of the volume leverage was 21% organic growth. And then also recall, we did do some actions, I would say at the end of FY '20 to take some cost out of some of those businesses and right-size the cost structure. And so we've been running at that level. I would tell you since Q2, roughly of last year. And so it's a combination of volume leverage and some of the cost controls.
Andrew Buscaglia
Okay, so mix -- I guess mix. You're not calling that as major contributor.
Joseph Kelley
Mix was -- yeah, I would tell you, mix was favorable, particularly if you look at our medical business, we had some favorable mix benefits there within ATS.
Andrew Buscaglia
Okay. Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Walt Liptak with Seaport. Your line is open.
Walter Liptak
Hey, good morning, guys.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Good morning.
Walter Liptak
I don't want to -- morning and don't want to beat a dead horse on the price cost thing. But the companies that we follow, I think you guys were doing the best up until this quarter on price cost. So just I understand the situation that you ran into this quarter, it sounds like Omicron may have impacted some of your suppliers, and so there might have been delays and maybe you guys had a little bit with absentees as in related to Omicron, but that seems to be going away. Is that the way that we should read that 100 basis points of headwind from price cost?
Joseph Kelley
Yeah. I guess Walt, I would read it as, as we implemented our price increases at year-end and to respond to the inflation pressures that we were seeing, you combine that with our strong backlog, which was up. If you think how we ended the year. It was up almost 90% over the prior year. And so the price realization of those price increases just take time to take effect. And so a lot of what we were shipping in Q1 was still priced at the old price points. So the price realization wasn't as beneficial in Q1 as it will be in Q2. And then it will be more beneficial, I will tell you then, in the back half of 2022. So I would tell you, it's a combination of the backlog as opposed to the Omicron issue. But I will
Walter Liptak
Okay.
Joseph Kelley
Also say. But despite that, Walter. I mean, 56.1% gross margin in the quarter. If you recall, since the divestiture, the screw a barrel business, we've been running at 55 to 57 range depending on mix in any given month. So I would tell you we were able to largely offset the negative price cost headwind with favorable mix and some volume leverage in the quarter.
Walter Liptak
Okay. Great. So just to be clear the price costs that you for 100 bps, that they didn't have anything to do with supply chain. Was there a headwind to the supply chain issues, the constraints you're talking about, or was that just people working harder?
Joseph Kelley
The headwind on the supply chain constraints I would speaks to our top-line growth rate and the revenue we were able to deliver as opposed to the gross margin percentage.
Walter Liptak
Okay. How much do you think that you were unable to ship this quarter because of that?
Joseph Kelley
Yet down hard. It's hard to put a number on it. And I wouldn't and I wouldn't tell you that, GAAP pushed from Q1 into Q2 because I think these issues are going to continue into Q2 as relates to supply chain challenges. But you could estimate that to be, I don't know, $10 million to $20 million is headwind we're looking at.
Walter Liptak
Okay. All right.Thanks for that. And then you pointed out the other day, I mean, if you had that 100 bps of price costs, the operating leverage was still pretty incredible. And so you're saying that that's largely volume mix or is this NBS Next that's really coming through?
Joseph Kelley
Largely volume mix in getting Q1, we have the benefit of the screw and barrel product line divestiture. So that in and of itself from a favorable mix standpoint was about 120 basis points.

I think what also to remember, through all of these with multiple different and strains on that company and the teams. NBS Next is really allowing us to be able to deliver on our customer commitments, as well as being able to deliver the kind of incremental margins you are seeing in the business. Now, consecutively for five quarters here. We are north of our committed 40% to 45% incremental margins in the quarter, we delivered 59 and so think of all the things that are going on in the business. And top of which were able to deliver the kind of quarter we delivered. I think that is really significant contribution from NBS.
Walter Liptak
Absolutely. And maybe a last one for me on the Vantage product that you were talking about. So how was the commercialization of that product going? Do you sell it through your direct sales force or do you go through distribution on it? And is it being bundled with other products in dispensing systems?
Sundaram Nagarajan
Now, it is what -- we really have very little distribution. We are almost a 100% direct unless than in a region where we don't have some sales coverage than we may have distribution. But mostly direct. No, it is not bundled with any other systems. We sell directly, the commercialization is going really well. I don't think -- we're getting governed more around supply chain constraints that we talked about rather than the demand for the product.
Walter Liptak
Okay. All right, great. And the Vantage product that I guess it helps you to penetrate some of your customers. Is it an incremental? Is it a big increase to the penetration of our customer if they start purchasing the Vantage product?
Sundaram Nagarajan
It is Incremental opportunity for applications that we are continuing to grow with those customers. So there's incremental in existing customers to think about our electronic business, we are part of our largest customers, product road map. So for us to continue to be relevant player in this market. We need to continue to deliver innovations that allow our customers to achieve their product goals. So Vantage is a great example of that, where our customers have specific product goals around moving packaging upstream to at the wafer level. This product does that.
Walter Liptak
Yeah, that's great. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Your final question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Connor Lynagh
Yes. Thanks. Naga, you made a comment in regards to M&A on needing to be financially disciplined, would you say that over the last year that valuation has been an impediment to doing more? Not to imply you've been sitting on your hands, obviously you just did a deal, but has there been any normalization in value expectations that you can see based on what's been happening in public markets?
Sundaram Nagarajan
No. There is no normalization yet. But I think for us, we start with strategy to make sure that we are focused on the end markets in the specific products, on medical and test and inspection. And those are not -- valuation in those markets are high, yet we've been able to find deals that we have been able to do in both those markets, mainly because we're very focused on what is the value that Nordson brings to that particular business. And can we deliver a financial return? I wouldn't say that we had a deal, we got passed up because of our valuation. That's not the case. It happens occasionally, but not in the recent past.
Connor Lynagh
Got it. That's helpful. And then just to sort of follow up a little bit more on the capital allocation. I mean, obviously, as I alluded to you -- you've deployed capital recently, but is there a point at which it makes sense to just return more capital than you have been? Or do you think it's better to sort of build a war chest and wait for markets to be where it makes more sense.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Joe, you want to take a piece of that?
Joseph Kelley
I can tell you, our M&A pipeline is active and robust and to Naga's point, I do believe that there are assets out there where Nordson is the better owner and we can deploy capital like we did on the NDC acquisition to create shareholder value. And so, we're sitting at a leverage ratio just under one time. That the EBITDA, I think we could identify other opportunities to continue to deploy capital through M&A. So we have this balanced approach where we are a dividend payer and we do do share buybacks to offset dilution. But when we looked at it from a growth perspective, we think there is opportunity where we could deploy capital towards M&A and create through shareholder value. And so that continues to be our focus. And we just did a deal this quarter and deployed $172 million. So we hope to be able to do more like that.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Yes. I think what I would add is our focus is growth. If you remember, our Investor Day, our focus is profitable growth in acquisition and is an equal part of that growth. We're committed to acquiring around -- clearly see a pathway to acquiring over $500 million dollars in revenue. We are in year two of our strategy. We have acquired I want to say $125, $130 million in revenue so far. We see a path to delivering on the goals we have for acquisition, remain committed. That is, I think, organic growth being our number one priority. But this is a capital light business. We really, we don't turn down projects. I mean, in the quarter we spent around $12 million Joe?
Joseph Kelley
Correct.
Sundaram Nagarajan
-- towards organic growth. But acquisition is a big part of how on our capital deployment strategy that's not changed and we'll continue to work that.
Connor Lynagh
Yep. Makes sense. Thank you.
Sundaram Nagarajan
Thank you.
