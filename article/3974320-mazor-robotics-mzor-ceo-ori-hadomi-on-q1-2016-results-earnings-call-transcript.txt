Greetings and welcome to the Mazor Roboticsâ First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Iâd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Polyviou, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael Polyviou
Thank you, operator. We also want to thank everyone for joining us today for Mazor Roboticsâ conference call and webcast to review the financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. On the call today are Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer, and Sharon Levita, Chief Financial Officer.
Before I turn the call over to Ori, I would like to make the following remarks concerning forward-looking statements. All statements in this conference call, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve and are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that may affect Mazorâs business, financial condition, and other operating results, which include but are not limited to the risk factors and other qualifications contained in the Form 20-F and other reports filed by Mazor with the SEC to which your attention is directed. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Mazor expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will present certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net loss and net loss per share. In Mazorâs press release and in the financial tables issued earlier today, which is located on the Companyâs Website at www.mazorrobotics.com, you will find definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the closest GAAP financial measures, as well as a discussion about why these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant to the Companyâs results.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Ori Hadomi. Ori, please go ahead.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael, and welcome to Mazor first quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the results and then we will review the market environment and the progress we have made executing the growth strategies that continue to maintain our leadership in the robotics spine and brain surgery markets.
Additionally, I will share some preliminary outcomes data for one of our prospective studies. On April 5, we announced that we received order for Five Renaissance Systems in the first quarter of 2016, which is another solid quarter and outperforming the year-ago first quarter when we sold three systems.
On a global basis, we ended the first quarter with 113 systems installed, of which 68 are in the U.S. This compares with 86 globally and 47 systems in the U.S. at the end of 2016 first quarter. We reported revenues of $6.4 million in the first quarter, a 42% increase compared to the year-ago first quarter. Recurring revenue increased 41% over the year-ago first quarter to $3.8 million. This year-over-year performance continues to demonstrate the acceptance and adoption of the Renaissance Systems.
To provide some more details on our first quarter performance, we installed four systems in the U.S.; New Jersey, North Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. Among this is Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center located in the Greater New York City metropolitan area. These systems include the Brain Module as well as the six hospitals in the U.S. with both the brain and the spine applications.
Robert Wood Johnson represents our seventh academic and teaching centers in the past few quarters, and yield outcome of a committed effort to get into these centers of influence. Internationally, we received a purchase order for Renaissance Systems from LifeHealthcare, our distribution partner in Australia. This is the first system in Australia the data continue to represent the best growth opportunities outside of the U.S. We currently have 20 systems throughout the region.
Our Q1 performance is a promising start to 2016. Our sales team is pursuing other opportunities and we received the first orders for Renaissance Systems this quarter from Mercy Hospital in Miami, an HCA-affiliated facility. This is the sixth overall system with HCA and included our U.S. installed base of 69 systems.
We continue to receive positive feedback from surgeons from those new to the system, as well as those who have been using it for quite some time. As we approach nearly 17,000 procedures performed with Renaissance, one of the first adopters of the Renaissance System in the U.S. was Tri-City Medical Center located in Oceanside, California. Tri-City purchased its Renaissance in 2012 and last month it performed its 700 procedure using the system.
Another early adopter, Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville, Florida also surpassed its 700 procedure using the Renaissance System for spine and brain procedures. Itâs an amazing achievement for both institutions and demonstrates the operability of the system. Tri-City and Baptist, each have two Renaissance Systems, having acquired the second system within 12 months of their initial purchase.
We have consistently reported that approximately half of the cases utilizing the Renaissance Systems are minimal invasive procedures, including multilevel cases, which continue to exceed the 12% and 13% broader market share figures for MIS cases. MIS procedures provide a greater benefit over traditional surgery for patients, providers and payers and surgeons that are immigrating their practice to MIS surgeries read about the ease of use, functionality and proven reliability of the Renaissance.
So we believe this will continue to drive a disproportionate percentage compared to the overall market. We continue to estimate the addressable U.S. market for Renaissance, including surgery centers, to be over 3,000 facilities, performing over 400,000 procedures annually, a figure, we believe, will continue to trend higher due to an aging population, enjoying a more active lifestyle.
Although we are currently capturing a fraction of these cases, I believe the focus on better patient outcome, lower healthcare cost and a hospice ROI position us well to capture greater share of these procedures. Additionally, our presence in the largest U.S. cities, New York City, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Dallas, also ensure weâre an available option to the largest base of patient population.
Asia continues to be our primary market outside the U.S. In fact, a peer-reviewed article published last month in the PLOS, Peopleâs Library of Science from surgeons at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan determined 98.74% of the KY ablation with Renaissance were accurately placed.
As a side note, Kaohsiung Medical Center, which purchased the Renaissance System in 2013, is one of the most active users of the system. They performed over 555 procedures to date, and we would anticipate a similar pace this year.
I recently returned from a trip to China, and based on my conversations with key opinion leaders and several hospital visits, I remain encouraged about our prospects. Although their administrative process continues to be long and complex, our investment and awareness raising effort is moving the needle in our favor.
Among the hospital I visited, all leading institutions with the ability to influence the broader Chinese markets, the purchase process is being implemented, and we would expect this to continue developing over the next couple of years. This is why we remain positive on the Chinese market for Renaissance.
Before I hand the call over Sharon to review the financial results for the first quarter, I want to provide an update on our growth strategies. First, we continue to increase our market footprint. We ended the first quarter with 15 capital sales reps and we recently included - that we increased that to 16 and our goal is 20 by the end of the year. This was the first time we ended the year with seven sales team reinforced by the fact that each system sold in the U.S. was by a different sales representative.
Internationally, we continue to work with our distribution partners to penetrate deeper into the market. On the regulatory front, we continue to make progress and move closer to approvals in key markets like Japan and South Korea.
Second, we remain focused on increasing the utilization of the systems, since it could also lead to new system sales. As we discussed on the last call, the average utilization in 2015 was 80 procedures. Apart from being a revenue stream, we believe utilization is a significant parameter and it could lead to new system sales.
Third and our last priority is to deliver product enhancement and product innovation regularly to maintain a high level of surgeon satisfaction. We have a rich innovation pipeline, which we believe will maintain our growth in our vertical leadership in our target markets for the foreseeable future.
Finally, we continue to engage in clinical studies and data collection. To the best of our knowledge, weâre the only Robotic company which initiated prospective outcome studies for its products, especially in an early phase of the adoption curve. We are investing in such studies, primarily because we have a great confidence in the clinical value that our products provide to the surgeon.
Secondarily, we believe it is an obligation of companies, such as Mazor, to provide decision makers with a much data possible in the value of certain process of high-end technologies, both clinically and economically. Iâm excited to report the growing body of clinical evidence of peer-reviewed articles and representation continue to support the clinical rationale to use our system.
Last week at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurosurgical Surgeons, Dr. Michael Wang, Chief of Neurosurgery at University of Miami Health System, presented preliminary results from the prospective comparative study on minimal invasive surgery. The study included 143 adult patients with degenerative lumbar disease treated with fusions of one to three levels. 118 patients were treated with the robotic arm and 25 were performed in the controlled free-hand arm.
Two of the patients in the control arm experienced complications and required a return visit to the operating room. At 8%, itâs statistically significant, because there were no complications or revision in the robotic arm, despite every robotic case involved 1.4 levels, compared to an average of 1.1 levels in the control arm.
The comparative result is impressive, but the data is preliminary and the study is continuing to enrolling patients and we are recruiting additional sites. We are not at all surprised by the data and itâs consistent with the data weâve seen in other studies. Dr. Wang will present you data next week, at Spine Week in Singapore and it has also been accepted as a podium presentation at [IMS] in mid-July and at NASS Annual Meeting in late October. We are also aware that a much larger retrospective comparative study, demonstrating improved clinical outcome has been accepted for podium presentation at the IMS Meeting, further corroborating the prospective results.
We are encouraged with these developments and I expect to share these with you on the third quarter conference call. However, Dr. Doron Dinstein, our Chief Medical Officer, will be available to address questions you have on the studies following the conclusion of our call.
Our performance in the first quarter reaffirms my view that 2016 will be another year of growth overall. Weâre off to a good start in Q2 and the new outcomes focused data continue to validate our technology. Iâm encouraged by the sales activity and the continued development of our R&D pipeline. Weâre making progress in each of our growth strategies and I believe our success will drive greater adoption and expand our installed base.
Now to review the financial highlights of the first quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori, and hello everyone. I will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $6.4 million, an increase of 42% compared to $4.5 million in the year ago first quarter. Geographically, revenue in the U.S. was $5.6 million or 88% of total revenue, with $0.8 million or 12% of revenue from the international market.
Capital sales revenue was $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2016, a 44% increase compared to $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2016, as we received orders for five systems compared to three systems in the first quarter of 2016.
Revenue from disposable kit sales grew to $2.4 million, a 50% increase, compared to $1.6 million in the last yearâs first quarter, reflecting the increased utilization primarily in the U.S. market, as well as increase in the installed base. Revenues generated from service and other income were $1.4 million compared to $1.1 million in the year-ago first quarter. Gross margin was 74.2%, reflecting a slightly lower ASP during the quarter, mainly in the international markets.
Operating expenses were $10 million compared to $8.5 million in the year-ago first quarter. The increase is primarily due to our continued investment in sales and marketing as we recruit more sales and clinical reps and invest in activities to raise our brand awareness, broaden our sales footprint. We also continue to invest in R&D to support increased product offering to clinical studies to validate the clinical and economic benefits of this system. This as well as other development projects will allow us to build on our leadership position.
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the first quarter of 2016 was $5.1 million or $0.12 per share compared to $5.2 million in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was $4.2 million or $0.10 per share compared to $4.4 million or $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2015.
During the quarter, cash used in operating activities was $2.9 million, a decrease compared to $4.2 million in the last yearâs fourth quarter, due to collection from customers. As of March 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $37.6 million, which we believe provide us with the resource to execute our business plans and to drive the continued adoption of our technology.
That concludes my remarks, and now I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary comments, and then we will take questions. Ori?
Ori Hadomi
In summary, we continue to execute our growth strategies, and we are off to a solid start in 2016. The continued growth in recurring revenue enhances our strong reputation in the market and I remain confident 2016 will be a record year in system sales and utilization.
Before handing the call to the operator, I want to point out that later this month we will be celebrating our third anniversary in NASDAQ. Also, on Tuesday, July 12, we will be hosting an Investor Day in New York City. The upcoming event will highlight Mazorâs market opportunity and we will have presentations from senior management and key clinical opinion leaders, as a well as a question-and-answer session.
Thank you again for joining the call. Operator, we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Cohen, with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Cohen
Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Iâll throw them all together at once.
Ori Hadomi
Hi, Jeff, good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning.
Sharon Levita
Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Cohen
So, three parts. If you could talk a little bit about some of the product enhancements and new product launches as far as software and the lateral approach? Secondly, talk a little bit about utilization trends that youâre seeing in the U.S. as far as equipment. And, thirdly, if you could discuss a little bit about the Company initiated clinical trials, if theyâve started and how they have gone thus far? Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Sure. I will start with the first two and I will hand the call to Doron to share a little bit about the study. As to the software enhancement, weâre all the time working on new applications. We introduced during NASS two main applications. One is what we call Global Balance, a software that will be released June 2016, but itâs still in development and will allow sophisticated analysis and planning of correction of the spine.
We also showed new tools that related to lateral fixation and other improvements. These will be launched during the year to the market, but I have nothing here to report, nothing significant to report about this at this point of time.
As to the utilization, as I mentioned earlier in my script, we still continue solid high utilization. You know that we report about this on an annual basis and the last report was about 80 and we donât see any indication that it goes below that, but that to continue and to show improvement, which focus in some of the - we have some strategy in place, how to focus on different accounts that may reduce the average. But, again, the number we are reporting on an annual basis. As to the clinical study, Doron Dinstein will provide more color.
Doron Dinstein
Absolutely, Ori. Thank you. And Jeff, thank you for the question. The clinical studies that we began recruiting patients almost two years ago are starting to bear fruit. The highest recruitment numbers that we have right now are in the minimally invasive - deserves as minimally invasive study, with robotics versus freehand. In this study, itâs limited up to three levels of fusion, so up to four vertebras. Anything longer than that goes to another study.
In this particular study, the time of - the deadline for the abstract submission for - IMS to NASS in the beginning of February. We had 143 patients enrolled in this particular study, and as Ori described, there were two complications and both of them led to revision surgeries and both occurred among the 25 controlled cases that were done freehand. In the 118 cases that were done with the robotic guidance, there were no complications or revision surgery. And that is statistically significant as Ori implied.
We also saw a reduction in fluoroscopy time and these are only preliminary results. Weâve, to date, recruited almost 100 additional patients; almost half-and-half between robotics and freehand control and weâre continuing to recruit and even add more centers to these studies to make the body of evidence even more robust than it currently is.
Jeffrey Cohen
Thanks, Doron. Might we see some updated data at NASS in the fall from the additional 100 recruited?
Doron Dinstein
I believe so. The abstract, which was accepted, had only these 143 patients, but I wonât be surprised if the surgeons will be providing a more up to date analyses for the patient population and studies.
Jeffrey Cohen
Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.
Doron Dinstein
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Matt Taylor with Barclays Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Taylor your line is open sir.
Matt Taylor
Sorry about that. Yes, just wanted to have an update from the other studies, the two other prospective studies, if you could give us an update on how those are enrolling, and when we might be able to see some outcomes there?
Doron Dinstein
Sure. Thank you for the question. The other two prospective studies are both deformity studies. One is focusing on adults and the other one is on children. In the adult study, we were slower on the recruitment; we currently have 30 individuals enrolled, with some of them being controlled patients.
We have recently created a very small notification to the inclusion criteria, which will allow us as an accelerated recruitment in that study by accepting more individuals with these longer constructs into the study.
The pediatric study, weâve recruited - we actually sent some non-controlled data, because we currently donât have control surgeons participating in that study. We have three recruiting centers; all of them use robotics, and are recruiting to the study. But, many surgeons unfortunately are unwilling to participate in the study. We are in advanced processes with one additional center of a key opinion leader and once we have an agreement signed with that center, a major academic center in the U.S., we will share that information.
What I will say that - the data that we see is very consistent with what youâve seen in other studies, meaning basically very high accuracy results with our robotic system, as I said, consistent with the prior data. But I donât have comparative data that is robust enough to share with you today. All I can say is that weâre actively recruiting.
Matt, just one other question I think that itâs worth mentioning. These studies were originally designed to be at least partially randomized. But the surgeons, especially the deformity surgeons are unwilling to randomize between robotics and freehand, which is I think a very strong endorsement of the clinical value of our technology.
However, from managing a study, it does create a problem, because obviously weâre interested in having level 1 evidence of randomized studies. But as I said, most of the surgeons are just beyond [indiscernible] they feel itâs basically unethical for them to offer freehand surgery to their patients.
Matt Taylor
Gotcha, okay. And then Ori, I wanted to ask about the placements this quarter. You announced the one at Mercy, which is great. Maybe, if you could give any color as you have in the past, kind of characterizing the pipeline. And then specifically, because we have seen your Australian distributor pull back on inventories with another company, I wanted to know if thereâs any disruption there. It sounds like things are going well, because you placed the system there. So, any update there will be great. Thanks.
Ori Hadomi
As weâve discussed, I donât see any reason to make any different assumptions about the international market, including Australia. And what we see today in the U.S. is very encouraging. The team is highly engaged with far more transparency and healthy communication between our team and the hospitals and we feel that weâre in the right direction to meet all targets and to make it a year of significant growth relative to previous years. So we are very encouraged, both internationally and domestically.
Matt Taylor
Thanks Ori.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Matt.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Gillings with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
John Gillings
Hey, guys. Can you hear me okay.
Ori Hadomi
Yes. We hear you John. Good morning.
John Gillings
Okay, great. So just wanted to talk briefly about the 41% increase in recurring revenue. You said that that was driven by increased utilization primarily. Could you talk to us a little bit about utilization in the sort of experienced, seasoned centers versus some of the new centers that have just recently got systems?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, I can give more color. I donât think that - we became better and better in engaging the centers at an early stage. We have some centers that joined us just a month ago and day before the quarter - they joined us a very short time ago. And during the first month or two months theyâve more than doubled than what we put to our sales as a target for new centers at the first 60, 90 days. So I think weâve learned a lot about how to engage, how to bring on board more than one surgeon and we are getting the benefit of that. Does that answer the question you wanted, or do you need anything more?
John Gillings
No, thatâs helpful. I just wanted to get a sense of how things are going, it sounds like things are picking up with the new centers. So then turning to the Brain Module, kind of the same thing, could you give us an idea of how the utilization is going with the Brain Module, so far?
Ori Hadomi
Brain, I think itâs slower than what we expected in the past, and we also learn about the brain market. I think that the brain market, at least to the area of DBS is relatively limited, and the adoption is somewhat slower. I also think that in a way we decided not to have a dedicated team - they never have a team thatâs dedicated to the brain. I didnât think that the market is big and attractive enough that it justifies splitting our team and also focusing on this market. We see it as an add-on, as an opportunity to have another stakeholder in the hospital.
This being said, sometimes it may complicate also the sales process. When you have a product with two applications, you may not be able to get the support of few different groups and I believe that some of our sales - some of our members of our sales team would try to short and simplify the sales process and probably would focus on the spine before they introduce up to the brain.
So all-in-all, we are a fine robotic Company. This is our core, this is our focus. We always thought that the brain - the opportunity as an add-on, but this is definitely not the core of our business. So, I donât see has any major impact on the slow adoption of brain, but we do learn from that.
John Gillings
Okay. Thatâs helpful. And then just one last one on the sales force. You talked a little bit about hiring there. And can you remind us the profile, the type of reps that youâre targeting and also do you run into any issues with non-compete agreements when you bring these guys in? Thanks.
Ori Hadomi
No, right now, I canât report any issue around the non-compete. I think that we have two main sales teams, one is the capital and the other one is clinical. The clinical teams we hire people who come either from orthopedic or from robotics or some of them are really generally from many different areas that have the right skills and meet the expectation in terms of personality, customer attitude, technological capabilities and either an understanding or experience in the operating room.
For the capital team, we are hiring people that most of them are very experienced in the area of surgical robotics in the country, or experience in the area of spine. And this is the target people that can work with the administration to have the right relationship, the right personality and we hire these people to join our team. Hence, I canât say that we have any issue with non-compete or something like that.
John Gillings
Okay, great. Thanks guys.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson
Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just wondering if you could give us an update on international business, maybe just refresh us on which countries youâre seeing the most success and then where you see the biggest opportunities going forward?
Ori Hadomi
Sure. International business, so, I think that as you know, today the vast majority of our business is in the U.S. The International accounts something between 20% to 30% if Iâm not mistaken for our overall business. We have activities in Europe with some, with active sites in Germany, Poland, Spain, and Russia. And we have also activity in Asia with active system in Australia and Taiwan, and we are doing our first steps in China, and we are putting some feet in the ground in Thailand and a few other smaller markets, just like Singapore and Hong Kong.
In terms of opportunities, I believe that China represents an opportunity, but itâs still to be proven. As I mentioned earlier in my call, I just returned back yesterday from China. It was for me a very encouraging trip and I do think that thereâs a real market, real opportunities and very educated segment in the market that we should target and can target. But we need to set expectations and understand the time it takes to make these type of transactions in China, and the communications will be needed. Iâm very satisfied with our distributor there.
Weâre also making very good steps with our regulatory process in Japan. But itâs still yet to give a clearer prediction when this occurrence will finally end. I hope it would be June 2016. But given the complexity of this process, it definitely can continue up to 2018. I hope I answered your question?
Mike Matson
And then just, I didnât hear a lot of commentary on the PRO solutions on the call. So Iâm just wondering where things stand with the launch of those and particularly the lateral version of that. Thanks.
Ori Hadomi
We just launched, as you know, during this quarter. We are gaining a lot of feedback of - doing cases. Right now, there is nothing of significance to report. It continues as we expected and I think the surgeons like it a lot. At this point of time, as you know, there is no incremental revenue that comes from the PRO. So you donât see any separation in our numbers. But this is something that I expect that later on will contribute to the adoption and weâd be one of the differentiator.
Mike Matson
All right. Thanks a lot.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much Mike.
Operator
Our next question comes from Craig Bijou with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Craig Bijou
Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to start with the performance during the quarter. You guys had two systems sold, better than last year, two more than what you sold in Q1 of last year, 50% growth in kit revenue. I wanted to ask how that compares to your expectations for the quarter and then is that type of performance relative to 2015, what we should expect for full year 2016?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. You probably remember also the profile of our first quarters from the previous years. I donât think the first quarter indicate about the - shows anything about what need to be expected in any other quarter. I would look at it at six months. I think that looking at the first six months should give you a fair comparison to the previous six months in the year ago - in the previous year. And then you may be able to make initial estimation. So I wouldnât take the first quarter as something as indicative to how the rest of the year will continue.
But as to your question to what extent the first quarter results is in line with what we expected, weâre very pleased with the result, both in the clinical and in the capital, and as I said earlier, we are confident in the results of this year and encouraged by the results of this quarter.
Craig Bijou
And then for Ori or Sharon. The systems revenue came in a little lower than we were expecting, especially considering one of the systems had a Brain Module as part of it. Sharon, you mentioned lower ASP on one of the international sales. I guess I just wanted to ask, if there are any negative trends on ASPs or anything that you would want to call out or have the ASPs been relatively consistent?
Sharon Levita
In the U.S., I think the ASPs are relatively consistent compared to 2015. In the international markets, we had an exception in the high price in Q1 2015, which has actually impacted this quarterâs ASP. So in general, in the international markets I think we foresee a little bit decrease in the prices, because of the different conditions in each country. But in the US, we are more or less stable compared to 2015 average prices.
Craig Bijou
Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
Sharon Levita
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tracy Marshbanks with First Analysis. Please go ahead.
Tracy Marshbanks
Thanks and good to hear from you. One question really focused on the capital sales strategy in the U.S., and what youâre seeing. You could open up new territories, you could open up new academic centers or you could try to go deep in your current metros, or even in your current accounts. As you add incremental resources, where do you see the biggest opportunity, how are you managing that where you focus? For example, would you add more people to New York than put them in another new Metro? What do you see as being more valuable for you?
Ori Hadomi
And there are few more options to consider while thinking about the strategy that I can relate to. All in all, I think that we are doing two things. One, we are focusing on the big cities, on the metropolitan cities. And weâre trying to put feet and grow the installed base in these areas. We are also focusing on academic centers, and the third one is building our relationship with international accounts and chains of the hospitals.
We believe that growing the footprint in the cities, together with some - often time is aligned with some of the major academic centers and working closely with national accounts will help us to continue the growth of our installed base and develop the business. We also keep this type of relationship with the hospital chains that they receive the benefit and get us a direct feedback from the surgeons and from the hospital administration and can take further decisions about growing the business.
Tracy Marshbanks
Okay. So I guess HCA would be sort of a prototype for that and so we could see you go into, if you will, other territories, but itâs really through probably a hospital chain customer, through your system?
Ori Hadomi
Most of the time.
Tracy Marshbanks
Yes. Okay, thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Sharon Levita
Thank you.
Operator
Mr. Hadomi, there are no further questions at this time. Would you like to make any closing remarks?
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much, operator. I wish everyone a good day and good quarter. We are already into the second quarter and Iâm looking forward talking to you at the next opportunity and having you at our Investor Day in July. Thank you very much and good day.
Operator
This concludes todayâs conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
