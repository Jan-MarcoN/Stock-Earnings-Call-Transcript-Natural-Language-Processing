On behalf of Quintiles, hello, and welcome to today's Quintiles Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Todd, and I will be your web events specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles' Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Karl. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.
Let's begin on Slide 3 with a few highlights. Our continued leadership is demonstrated by our fifth consecutive quarter of strong new business, with year-to-date book-to-bills in both business segments greater than our 5-year historical averages. In addition to strong new business, we are pleased with our operational accomplishments, which continue to drive attractive margins. Our revenue reflects factors discussed on previous calls, challenging comparables, successful transitioning of older contracts to significant new business won and foreign currency. Our productivity programs and expense management continue to shine, bringing us attractive profitability.
We continue to focus on executing our strategy and maintaining our leadership within the industry. From my meetings with top executives in the industry, there's a belief that Quintiles can help define new paradigms for development and commercialization. In addition, beyond the numbers, this quarter, we received numerous awards for our employees, technology and delivery solutions, some of which I'll touch on later.
Now moving to the numbers. Our consolidated net new business of $1.34 billion grew 29% in the third quarter and 20% on a year-to-date basis to $3.6 billion. Our quarterly streak of $1 billion plus quarters in net new business has continued, which contributed to a healthy backlog of $9.6 billion, positioning us well for the future.
The book-to-bill ratio in the current quarter was 1.44. The year-to-date book-to-bill ratio is 1.28x our 9-month net service revenues.
In the Product Development segment, our sales machine is finding strong volume of RFPs and creating demand in the marketplace across a spectrum of our customers: the large, the midsize and the emerging pharma, including biotech. In fact, we're seeing an increase in demand across midsize and emerging pharma, resulting in all 3 groups contributing meaningfully to our net new business wins for this year.
We're also seeing interest in delivery solutions that encapsulate the majority of our broad services into end-to-end partnerships. We believe these types of partnerships, which we define as strategic, will become more common in the longer term and will be a key to above-market growth.
During the quarter, we were selected by another important pharma company to be their sole provider of development services, utilizing a broad range of our Product Development capabilities. This is the second sizable sole provider relationship we've been awarded this year.
The great thing about these relationships is that change and improvement to the development process can be achieved in a way that cannot be done with multiple vendors. It's important to note that we only record new business from these partnerships and our net new business and backlog when it's supported by written confirmation and not immediately as an estimated lump sum. Therefore, for instance, we expect this new strategic relationship to result in additional net new business and backlog in future quarters.
In Product Development, the increase in demand, coupled with increased win rates, has resulted in 18% net new business growth to $2.8 billion for the first 9 months of the year and 9% or $862 million for the third quarter. The book-to-bill for the first 9 months of the year is 1.31, and in the third quarter, it's about 1.21x net services revenues.
In our Integrated Healthcare Services segment, I'm happy to report net new business growth of 93% to $479 million in the quarter and 30% growth for the first 9 months of the year to $792 million. On our second quarter earnings call, we announced a commercial opportunity valued at approximately $100 million, which slipped from the second quarter into the third quarter. In addition, in this quarter, we recorded significant additional bookings in that segment.
Our Integrated Healthcare Services segment book was very strong, finishing at $2.19 billion for the quarter and book-to-bill of 1.20 for the first 9 months of the year.
In addition, this morning, we announced an equity repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors of up to $125 million in the aggregate. Using cash in our balance sheet, we expect this program will be accretive to shareholder value.
Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Kevin Gordon, who will provide greater detail.
Kevin K. Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
Before we start, please note we are discussing certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures today, so please reference the reconciliations included in the supplemental information slides.
We were pleased to complete the Novella transaction during the quarter. Novella's operating results from the date of acquisition, which was September 16, and the associated balance sheet purchase accounting are included in our consolidated results for the quarter and have an insignificant impact to our consolidated earnings.
Turning to Slide 4. Let's begin with the consolidated results. For the quarter ended September 30, 2013, our consolidated service revenues grew 4% compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which we refer to as constant currency growth. At actual foreign exchange rates, our service revenues grew 2.1% to $932.7 million.
The growth in Product Development was offset by a decline in revenues in the Integrated Healthcare Services segment due to lower net new business recorded in the commercial business in the first half of the year and cancellations and scope modifications in the commercial business, partially offset by over 20% growth in observational.
We also experienced an unfavorable foreign currency headwind of $17.8 million or 1.9% of constant currency service revenues. For the 9 months ended September 30, our constant currency revenue growth was 4.2% compared to the same period in 2012. At actual foreign exchange rates, our service revenues of over $2.8 billion grew 2.1%. The negative foreign currency impact of 2.1% equated to approximately $56.2 million.
The global diversification of our service revenues remained relatively consistent. The North America and Latin America region contributed 41%. The Europe, Middle East and Africa region contributed 38%, and the Asia Pacific region contributed 21% of the total consolidated revenues.
Our customer base is diverse, with over 400 customers and no customer representing more than 10% of our service revenues for the third quarter or for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013.
Adjusted income from operations grew 20.4% to $132.5 million, representing 220 basis points of margin expansion compared to the same period last year. This included 100 basis points of positive foreign exchange tailwind. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted income from operations was $374.9 million, representing growth of 13.3% and 140 basis points of margin expansion. Of this 140 basis points, 70 basis points was due to favorable foreign exchange. The margin increase was from the larger percentage of revenues from the higher-margin Product Development segment, along with the improvements that we incurred in that segment.
Certain costs are not allocated to our segments and are reported as general corporate and unallocated expenses included in SG&A. These costs totaled $19.8 million during the third quarter compared to $24.9 million for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to the termination of management fee agreement with affiliates of certain of our shareholders and a continued focus on cost controls. Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of revenues compared to 21% in the prior year, primarily due to increased compensation and related expenses, as well as costs from our Expression Analysis and Novella acquisitions.
Adjusted net income grew 36.7% to $71.9 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. For the 9-month period ended September 30, our adjusted net income was $192.5 million, representing growth of 19.8%. Contributing to the adjusted net income growth was reduced interest expense due to the lower interest rates from the repricing of our term loan B2 in December 2012, coupled with a 50-basis-point interest rate step down in August 2013, triggered by the reduced leverage levels achieved with the $350 million debt repayment from the net IPO proceeds.
Diluted non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 20% to $0.54 per share in the quarter ended September 30. For the 9 months ended September 30, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 12.5% to $1.53 per share. Both periods were impacted by the increased share dilution due to shares issued in the IPO.
We recognize $7.2 million of net restructuring charges during the third quarter and $11.9 million year to date in connection with our February 2013 approved restructuring plan. We do expect to incur additional costs under this plan during the remainder of the year.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 29.1% during the quarter compared to 29.7% for the same period last year and 30.7% compared to 34.5% for the 9 months ending period September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The current year effective tax rates were positively impacted by our assertion change in the second quarter regarding the permanent reinvestment of earnings in most foreign jurisdictions.
Our cash balance at September 30 was $610 million compared to $568 million at the end of 2012. This balance includes a net outflow of $145 million of cash paid for the Novella acquisition. Cash flow from operations was $181.9 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $175.7 million for the same period in 2012. This year has been negatively impacted by $32.5 million of cash payments that related to the termination or amendment of certain agreements with affiliates and debt repayment in the second quarter.
Capital expenditures were $77.9 million year to date compared to $49.4 million during the same period in 2012. We continue to invest in IT innovation and customer offerings during the current period, coupled with expansions and facility upgrades in the first half of the year in the Asia markets to support our growth.
Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at September 30, 2013, was $1.44 billion compared to $1.85 billion at the end of December 2012.
Now please turn to Slide 5 for a look at our 2 reporting segments. Our Product Development segment contributed 76% of our service revenues while our Integrated Healthcare Services segment contributed 24% on a year-to-date basis. Product Development service revenue contribution was 2% more than the same period in 2012.
Product Development's constant currency revenue growth was 6.3% compared to the same period last year. At actual foreign exchange rate, Product Development service revenues grew 5.5% to $714.2 million. Constant currency growth was generated from net volume increases within clinical services and volume increases in our global labs, offset by the expected wind down of an exceptionally large clinical project and a large consulting services rescue project. Revenues were positively impacted by the acquisitions of Expression Analysis and Novella, which occurred in the third quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013, respectively.
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $140.6 million, 16% growth at actual rates and 9.3% at constant currency rates. Product Development income from operations margin was 19.7% in the third quarter, representing an expansion of 180 basis points compared to the same period last year, benefiting from 130 basis points of positive foreign exchange. Margins expanded as a result of leveraging our global infrastructure, our restructuring programs, improvements within our Phase I unit and stabilization of resource on-boarding in advance of the expected ramp-up of new projects due to the strength of our net new business.
Integrated Healthcare Services service revenue was $218.5 million in the quarter, a decline of 7.6% or $17.9 million at actual foreign exchange rates compared to the same period last year. Unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations totaled $12.4 million for the quarter. Service revenues at constant currency declined 2.3% or $5.5 million, primarily due to lower new business from the first half of 2013 and negative scope modifications and cancellations from the fourth quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2013.
Integrated Healthcare Services income from operations for the third quarter was $11.7 million, down 5.8% at actual exchange rates but up 7% at constant currency rates compared with the comparable 2012 period. The income from operations margin for the quarter of 5.3% was negatively impacted by 40 basis points of foreign exchange but still represented an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year. The 50-basis-point constant rate margin expansion was a direct result of our continued focus on resource management and expense controls.
In summary, our third quarter results reflects solid performance in Product Development with good revenue growth offset by exceptionally large clinical and consulting projects winding down. These projects, which will be nearly complete by the end of 2013. The revenue burn rate on these projects is lower year-over-year from 2012 and will reduce further year-over-year in 2014 compared to this year. However, the strong new business wins from the last 5 quarters have begun to provide an offset as the projects start up, generating the current mid-single-digit revenue growth rate, and the overall growth rate is expected to increase in the second half of 2014.
Integrated Healthcare Services had its second sequential quarter of improved margin performance, while revenue growth continued to be hampered by negative foreign exchange headwinds. We believe of equal importance was the strong new business booked during the quarter to improve the year-to-date book-to-bill ratio to 1.2x the quarter's revenues.
Now let's turn to Slide 6. Before I move to our financial guidance, I want to address the expiration of the lockup. This has been a question we have received frequently over the past several weeks. The lockup agreement entered into by all shareholders and all stock option holders in connection with the IPO in May of this year will expire on Sunday, November 17.
The shares subject to the lockup will be released as of November 18. We expect there will be interest on the part of existing and former employee shareholders and vested stock option holders, some of whom have held shares for a decade, to take advantage of this liquidity and diversification opportunity, particularly due to the company's long tenure as a private company.
We announced this morning an equity repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase outstanding common stock or vested in the money stock options up to an aggregate value of $125 million. We intend to use cash on our balance sheet for accretive share repurchases, further demonstrating the confidence we have in our business and the company's ability to generate strong cash flows.
Now the guidance update for the fiscal year 2013. We expect to achieve service revenues between $3.77 billion and $3.8 billion, which represent a constant currency growth rate of 4.1% to 4.9%. We are raising our diluted adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $2.03 and $2.09 per share, representing growth of 14.7% to 18.1%, and diluted GAAP earnings per share to between $1.71 and $1.77 per share. We expect an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 30%.
These estimates assumes September foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect. Estimated service revenues of approximately $30 million are included from the Novella acquisition, which is expected to have an insignificant impact on adjusted diluted EPS due to purchase accounting expenses. The guidance also does not reflect the impact of any potential purchases pursuant to our equity repurchase plan.
I will now turn it back to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Kevin. Taking a look at Slide 7 and to summarize, we continue to execute against our strategy as demonstrated by our third quarter financial results and operational accomplishments. We are preparing for renewed growth. We have had 5 consecutive quarters with net new business over $1 billion, a total of $6.1 billion. And our backlog has grown to an industry-leading $9.6 billion, providing an excellent long-term foundation. We are managing our way through a few large contracts that are ending, but in our everyday operations, we can see the transition of activities occurring from legacy contracts to growth.
Operationally, most of you know, we are a people-based business. To deliver for our customers and to deliver solid financial results, this means we must be experts in balancing the supply and demand of people. Our quality reputation has built on an employee-base model, and we are known for consistent, high-quality people around the world. Our margins have been strong this year, particularly this quarter. We are currently doing a very detailed analysis of the resources required to support our industry-leading backlog and anticipated growth. As we have said consistently, our preference is to deliver you earnings growth through top line growth while sustaining our industry-leading margins.
In Product Development, we continue to lead. Year to date, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.31, and for the last 12 months, it is 1.37. This is recognition of the deepest therapeutic skills, the broadest reach and award-winning technologies. I'm regularly in discussions with our customers about how we can make the Product Development process more efficient and improve the probability of success. Our drug developers are intimately involved in the development of protocols of key customers, and our world-class consultants have found double-digit efficiencies in some situations. We're engaged in strategic partnership discussions, our kind of strategic, not just preferred staffing. Because of this step, we had a couple more partnerships this quarter along these lines with incremental business expected to come in future quarters.
Regarding IHS, you can see the third quarter was strong for new business, which will help our growth next year. More important to me, however, is that our strategy, including our view of how the commercial organization needs to evolve and our ability to execute, is being well-received by customers. We plan to continue to reshape this business in coming quarters, and I'm excited about where we can go.
On the acquisition front, we closed Novella this quarter. Our growth strategy is primarily organic with selective acquisitions of capabilities that enhance our ability to grow. Novella fits those criteria, bringing us emerging biopharma oncology medical device skills and customers. Also of note this quarter was great results in our late-stage business centered around our successful acquisition of Outcome Sciences in 2011.
We also continue to be excited about the industry-leading projects coming out of Expression Analysis, a genomic sequencing and analysis company that we acquired in 2012, helping us to become a leader in bringing genomics to clinical work.
Before I close, I want to talk about our people in management. Earlier this month, I was in Asia, Japan and China in particular. We celebrated our 20th anniversary in Japan, and in attendance were over 30 senior executives from Japanese pharmaceutical companies. And we've been in China since 1997. I met with top executives from both global and Chinese pharmaceutical companies in China. Meeting with the leaders of these Chinese companies was exciting, and there's clear recognition of what Quintiles and its market leadership can do for them.
I am pleased as I travel the world to see the quality and longevity of our leadership. As you know, we are the strongest company in our sector in Asia and our position to bring solutions and development expertise to Asia's growing local and regional markets.
Our leadership is demonstrated by many awards. We're proud to have won the Eagle Award from the Society of Clinical Researchers. This is the investigators. Incredibly, we won in all 12 categories among this important constituency.
In addition to these awards, our ability to assist customers is demonstrated by our contributions to medical and scientific leader -- literature, I'm sorry. For instance, our scientists were co-authors on a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as another publication detailing the resistance patterns associated with patients with breast cancer. These publications demonstrate a long history of clinical, statistical and applied research, which assists our customers.
Our methodologies are increasingly becoming the standard for research. For example, our Outcome group recently published a third edition of the user guide for patient registries of observational studies. And this quarter, it was translated into Chinese for local market needs.
In Europe, an expert from Outcome was invited to advise the European Medicines Agency on best practices for studying the effectiveness of medicines in everyday real world settings. As we understand it, this is a first for a company of our type.
Now over 31 years old, Quintiles has a strong global executive team. I believe it's the best in the industry. A part of having strong leadership team is effective succession and management development. John Ratliff, our COO and President, has decided to move on at the end of this year. Over the decade we were private, John provided great leadership. John has also been a great partner to me, and we wish John well in his endeavors. John, along with Dr. Gillings and others, have developed an outstanding management team with over 25 years of experience on average. I'm confident in the ability of our deep management team to continue to execute in our day-to-day operational delivery needs while also innovating to deliver value to our customers.
In closing, we're very pleased with our solid third quarter performance. I'm very proud of what we're accomplishing as the industry leader. We are known as the company in the industry that can see around corners, and we continue to do that. We're being recognized as the leader both by customers and third parties. We're changing clinical development, and we're helping usher in the next commercial sales model.
I would also like to recognize and thank the entire Quintiles team, now about 28,000 strong, for their innovation, hard work and commitment.
Now let me turn the call back to Karl to begin the question-and-answer session.
Karl Deonanan
Thanks, Tom. We are ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Todd, you may now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Gross profit in Product Development, really strong again this quarter, much better than what we were looking for. I was wondering if you guys could maybe just spend a little bit of time talking about some of the drivers behind the gross product -- gross profit in Product Development? And maybe specifically, central lab seems to have been strong from your largest competitor. Wondering if maybe you could talk about that as a driver of gross profit and maybe what you're seeing in the landscape for central lab.
Kevin K. Gordon
Bob, it's Kevin. With respect to the margins, I think we've said pretty consistently, as we're coming through this transition of our backlog where we have certain large projects that are winding down, which you heard us talk about in the remarks, and then the new business coming in, we're actually at a period of time where we're transitioning prior to ramping up those resources. So we have very effective headcount management within the clinical side in that transition of the backlog that we're seeing. That's been a big contributor. You also note that we pointed out the element or the contribution in the margins from currency, which as you saw, weren't necessarily that minor this quarter. And then thirdly, we did announce restructuring program last year and then earlier this year where we are making some shifts in how we are approaching our service offering and where we're doing that from, and we're beginning to see the benefits of that. So those 3 factors, I think, contributed pretty significantly to the margins coming through the quarter. With respect to QLABs, I think you know that continues to contribute well. It continues to grow. We saw growth in the quarter as we have coming through the previous quarters. So it continues to be a strong contributor overall to the Product Development segment.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. And then if I could switch over to biotech. Clearly, much bigger focus as of late given what's going on in the biopharma pipelines. And I know inter-quarter, you guys obviously pushed deeper with the Novella acquisition. I was maybe hoping you could just spend a little bit of time talking about what specifically you're seeing from the biotech client base as of late?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, a couple of things, Bob. It's Tom. We are seeing an increase in RFP volume from some those organizations. And we're seeing strength in both the mid segment and the emerging biopharma. I think like you, you can see some of the funding moving into that part of the industry and a lot of interest in the products. And frankly, we continue to use our sales machine to press into that segment of the marketplace.
Operator
And your next question is from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Tom, can you talk a bit more about what's driving the better bookings in IHS? It was a pretty striking change and awards versus the second quarter. Do you think that's partly just timing quarter-to-quarter? Or are you seeing a real uptick in demand from clients?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I have to say that is a business where you'll see lumpy sales. So in fact, there is an aspect of timing, John. I appreciate you bringing that up. On the other hand, we are seeing a real interest from the commercial customers, especially those who are looking at their product launches over the next several years, and how can they more effectively variabilize and what strategies can they use to understand the provider segments, what's happening with the IDNs and really sell more effectively. So this interest is coming from very senior levels in the pharmaceutical firms. And our array of services where we bring to the table the strategy capability that can do good consulting, we bring an organization that really understands outcome information, which is increasingly becoming part of what the pharmaceutical firms need to drive their sales organizations from. And then, of course, the feet on the street, both in terms of not just traditional sales reps but medical science liaisons and nurse educators, seems to be a model that is generating a lot of interest. So I mean, I'm optimistic. It's going to be lumpy, but I'm optimistic based on the discussions I'm in. And I know literally discussions along these lines are taking place today, yesterday. So I'm optimistic for the future in this segment.
Kevin K. Gordon
John, just to add, this is Kevin. Just to add, it was a really strong quarter really across the segments. So as we saw that contribution, it was not only the commercial business but observational side of the business, which you heard us remark about the strength of their revenue growth in the quarter, also saw very, very strong new business growth in the quarter. So it was a good contributor on both parts of the segment.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
That's very helpful. And my follow-up is also IHS-related. To what extent have you fully benefited from the cross-sell opportunities between Product Development and IHS? Do you see fairly consistent client overlap using those 2 businesses? Or are they really distinct offerings in the client's mind?
Thomas H. Pike
We are bringing them together. Interestingly, I think our customers have a history of being pretty siloed between our development commercial organizations. But just as when you look at the need to get drugs not only approved but paid for on the clinical side and when you look at the implications of the new medications on the medical affairs group and commercial, you can see deep interests. So even within the week, I've been in discussions about how can our clinical expertise really help supplement the medical affairs organization and commercial organizations moving forward. The other thing to what Kevin was describing, this interest in real world data and observational data continues to increase because our customers really are interested in how does their medicine impact the practice of medicine out in the field so that they can really try to make sure that they're having positive outcomes for their patients. So we are seeing more interest. I can tell you, it's not a huge driver of our new business yet. But the encouraging thing is that you're seeing those silos break down in the large pharmaceutical firms.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Just 2 quick questions here. First of all, can you just give us some color on just the average term of the new business additions to the backlog and whether when we think kind of like ahead to next year, should we expect conversion to be in line with historical levels? And then on IHS, obviously improving in the quarter. We're still seeing some margin compression. When you look at the new business that you're adding in on that segment, do you expect to see stabilization in margins next year? And could we even see this segment turning kind of like the trend around?
Kevin K. Gordon
Sure. Let me first start with the Product Development side and the burn rate, Ricky. As we look at the net new business coming in, our average burn or average duration of a contract historically has been in the 48- to 50-month range in terms of the term it takes to complete. We've seen that actually go up slightly to closer to the 50 months or to the high end of that range as we look at the backlog burn coming through. So not terribly different than what we've seen in the past, reasonably consistent but closer to the high end of the range. With respect to Integrated Health, I would point to the fact that our margins actually are very much in line and slightly better than last year on the Integrated Healthcare segment. And on a constant currency basis, we're actually up 7% year-over-year. So I think you are seeing from that perspective through the revenue and/or the cost controls, you are seeing improvement on a constant currency basis through that. As we look forward, I'm not really giving guidance at this point, but I think we've consistently indicated that we see an opportunity to improve our margins in that segment. And we do continue to expect that, that will occur whether through mix of business within the segment and/or just the operational performance of the businesses.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I was wondering if we could get a little bit of at least directional commentary on movements within segments. So starting with IHS, for example, you called out observational study strength in demand. I guess I'm curious about how much of the IHS business does observational represent. And what's the margin difference, if any, between your observational work and your other standard commercial works such that if we see observational grow, that's a positive shift in mix on the margin?
Kevin K. Gordon
Obviously, the commercial sales side of the business is a long-standing business that we've had and it represents a majority or a very significant portion of the revenues of that business. And as you know, we talked about the historical CSO business being the western portion versus perhaps the higher-margin as we've gone from the 50%-ish range into the more eastern and more attractive potentially from a margin perspective business. And then some of the strategic connectivity or the convergence of those 2 that Tom just referred to, I think there's good margin capabilities there. With respect to margin opportunity, I think your question said something about shrinking of observational. We actually see expansion and increase in observational opportunities. We've seen both our interventional side, which would be our later-stage business from a 3B4 [ph] perspective into the observational and registries. We see -- have seen pretty strong demand in that area and expect that will continue to grow, Dave. From a margin perspective, the businesses will continue to evolve. We do have the overhang from the purchase accounting in the observational side that has a negative impact on their margins, which will abate as we go over the next couple of years, and we'll see greater improvement there.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I meant to say growing if I didn't. I think I did. So moving then to the Product Development. Moving to Product Development, I'm curious about the sole provider relationships. Those are fairly rare with clients in this space. They typically don't want to put all their eggs in one basket. They clearly are willing to do that with Quintiles in a couple of cases. Could you elaborate a little bit on those relationships in terms of are they sole provider relationships across the entirety of the client's therapeutic areas? And I suppose what type of pricing concession do you have to give to entice them to line up with only Quintiles?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, David, it's a great question. And with regard to sole providers, we are pleased that we have a couple that we've signed this year. And as you say, I think a company really needs to be able to provide breadth and depth to be a sole provider for an organization. You may know that we have very limited number of subcontractors. We're in 100 countries. We're the largest of our type in Product Development. And it gives us an ability to provide service to these organizations across all the different therapeutic areas. The way we think about that is basically we start with 100%. And then there may be times that we'll work with the customer, and if we feel that they need to be supplemented outside of us, of course, we'll do the right thing for the customer. But generally, we start across the entire therapeutic spectrum. In terms of pricing, basically, the way we view this is that we need to be market competitive in areas where pricing has commoditized a bit. And then we need to charge for value added in areas where we're differentiated. And I think these contracts reflect really simply market competitiveness in those areas. But the great thing about them is that we're able to get higher utilization of our organization. We're able to forecast demand more effectively because we're working very closely with them. And so for our business, the net benefits of better forecasting and incremental utilization are really valuable. For the customer, the big benefit to working with Quintiles, we have the industry-leading technologies. We have industry-leading methodologies. We're the only ones really with a tool to help development of protocols that we developed in our Infosario suite. And so for the customer, the benefit is that we're in there deeply. We can really change what they do in a way with them, in a way that you can't do across multiple vendors. You can picture, David, that if you have multiple vendors, then you have to be the integrator as the customer. But when there's just 2 of us, when it's a customer and us, we can actually put together best practices, SOPs, that really achieve industry-leading metrics. So without getting into it in too much detail, I think for the customers, these are beneficial. For us, they're beneficial because of the utilization and forecasted ability. And we think we're one of the few, if not the only, company that can really be credible doing this.

And your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First one, just on cancellations, it seems -- it doesn't seem like it's a big deal, but we -- you did have a competitor also kind of mention it yesterday. Can you just talk -- I think you called it out for the commercial business and maybe some -- a little bit in IHS, but can you just talk about the degree to which cancellations factored into the floor [ph]?
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. In terms of IHS in particular, the modifications or cancellations we referenced were more so late last year and in the second quarter. So they had certainly an impact on revenue on a year-over-year comparative basis. But nothing remarkable on either segment in the quarter that would say it was out of the ordinary from a cancellation perspective, Tycho.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then...
Thomas H. Pike
And you've seen a couple of large announcements from the pharmaceutical firms, and those, we don't view them as having effect on us.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And then if we think about M&A, just wondering, a, if you can comment on your appetite. Obviously, with the buyback, you're going to be changing your capital strategy a little bit. And then, b, if you can just give us an update on Expression? It's been kind of a year since you did the deal. I noticed you announced the pre-profiling feasibility study with McKesson. So just kind of wondering how that has tracked as well.
Thomas H. Pike
Maybe I'll start on that and Kevin can chip in since he's spoke about some of the details. We have strong cash flow in the business. And we really want to try to make sure that we're delivering shareholder value for our investors. And we took a look at the situation, and frankly, listened to feedback in September and decided that among our choices, the best use of some of that cash in our balance sheet was associated with the repurchase. And so I don't think it's actually changed our strategy, Tycho, at all. We actually have -- we have plenty of capacity, plenty of cash flow for the strategy we've laid out, which is really tactical tuck-ins that help improve our capabilities in key areas around the world. The second thing -- well, I guess that would be the main thing. On Expression Analysis is -- we're really excited about it. One of the things that it lets us do is it lets us move into spaces that are difficult for some of our competitors, and it really keeps us on the leading edge of what's going on in genomics and drug development. And we have a couple of partnerships. We announced one where we're working with U.S. Oncology, looking at pre-profiling, which could be a major help to the industry. If we can start having a pool of patients who are pre-profiled, associated per targeted drug development, I think we could really help the industry with that. And then it gets us into some very interesting areas. For instance, in the provider realm, as some of the providers are starting to look at the way they can help their patients by understanding the genomics more effectively. We're looking at a number of agreements, number of relationships that are very interesting there. So I have to say I'm really excited. We have a great leader there in Steve McPhail, he's well regarded in the industry, and I think that it's one of the more exciting areas of what we do every day.

Your next question is from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Kevin, you talked a little bit about the margin tailwind, if you will, from this transition of work. I'm just wondering if there's a time in the future where you're going to get to a point where the investments you're making to ramp new business are greater than the benefits you're seeing from the margin benefit from business that's kind of tailing off, and so you might see the consolidated margin pull back a little bit. Is that something we should expect to happen? And if so, when?
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes, I wouldn't think that or I wouldn't characterize it as probably being a significant impact. But there's clearly, as we go through the rest of the year and into the early part of next year, as we ramp-up some of that significant net new business, there will be a need for us to add resources. However, I would say historically, you've seen us do that very successfully in preparation for the work and to deliver the work very effectively. I think that's reflected in the consistency of the performance that you've seen from the company over even the last 5 years that we rolled out during the IPO period of our ability to effectively manage, taking on large trials, large new business and effectively planning our resources. We've done a very good job, I think the management team here has done a very good job, of managing resources throughout this year in relation to the backlog and the contracts as they're transitioning. And certainly, we have an expectation that we will invest here going forward. Now will it have some impact? It will have some impact, I expect, but I don't believe it's going to be a significant out-of-the-ordinary situation for us.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And then the other one I wanted to ask was just about the M&A, specifically on Novella. What did you see there that you thought would be a good addition to the portfolio? Kind of what's the differentiator there for Novella? And then what does your M&A pipeline look like at this point?
Thomas H. Pike
The 2 things. We have been searching for a while, Tim, for an organization that could help us in both the oncology and medical device area. And Novella really fits that bill. They work primarily -- when you look at their portfolio of customers, they work primarily with smaller biopharma. That, we view, as an opportunity area for us. And so they are just about a perfect fit. I have to say, we're also really pleased with the executive team that we're bringing in. We know them. And I think from the beginning, they're going to make a nice contribution for the -- a slightly differentiated service for some of our customers who are interested in that.
Kevin K. Gordon
Tim, regarding pipeline, we're obviously always looking in the market to add capabilities to our portfolio. You've seen that with the acquisitions we've done with Advion from a bioanalytical standpoint; Expression Analysis, which Tom has commented on a lot today; and then now Novella. So we're very active in the market. We look for opportunities that -- whether they're tuck-in type acquisitions that is our focus. We talk consistently about adding 1% to 2% of revenues from acquisitions, and we'll continue to look to do that, and I think we have a strong group that leads that activity. Just to follow up a little bit, too, on the question earlier, and I think it connects to yours a little, Tim, as well, is the cash that's being allocated for the repurchase program, we feel very strongly that the cash, obviously, today is available on the balance sheet. And from a cash flow perspective coming through the third quarter, our free cash flow in the third quarter was $163 million for the quarter. So the strength of the cash flow that the company is generating should not only allow us to effectuate that orderly repurchase program but also continue to fill our acquisition opportunities that we're excited about.

Your next question is from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just following up on the question about the sole provider relationship. Just curious when you expect that to become a contributor to your revenue line, as well as how much of that was incremental. And what was the status of the relationship with that client before this new deal was signed?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I don't -- I can't -- Doug, it's Tom. I can't get into too much detail because I -- so let me talk about them more generally. There are a number of customers who typically are more midsize, but we're seeing it at a variety of levels, who are interested in whether they can utilize more of our organization to be more effective with the development process in particular. And so this customer is one of those, existing customer who knows us who says, "Can you do more?" And so that would be somewhat typical, Doug, of what you see in that realm. And what else did you -- within that do you want to comment on? I'm sorry.
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. Doug, clearly, they're our customer I know from -- or the customer base we've worked with. All of the larger pharma companies have been customers of ours for some time. And you drop down even into the midsize, and you'd have that as well across that spectrum of 400 customers. So yes, they are an existing customer. There is an existing relationship. We expect that to be a long-term relationship. It's also important to know, I think as Tom made it in his remarks, although we've signed that relationship, that was not a significant contributor to net new business in the quarter. There's an expectation that, that will drive incremental net new business as we go forward with that relationship.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, these are long-term relationships. So you don't -- the key is, for us, that you can forecast, you don't have sales costs associated with them. And you can really, therefore, dedicate some resources to these customers and really help them drive value is the key. That's what we're all about.

Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So just a question on the operating margin and sort of looking at the progression from 3Q to 4Q. I would assume that the -- you just implied in your guidance that you're expecting the gross margins essentially come down -- or the operating margin to come down between Q3 and Q4. I'm just wondering on just sort of how we should sort of think about the margin potential going forward, for margin expansion?
Kevin K. Gordon
Well, I guess it's easy to say to be consistent with what we said, our focus at this time is really focused on driving that top line. And you see that there's huge market potential out there for us to grow revenue. We have the leading industry margins today. You see in net new business with the book-to-bills that we're booking, we are -- our win rates are up. We're taking more share. We're doing that at a time where we're transitioning backlog a bit, which is actually contributing to our margins. We expect that somewhat to continue here in the short term. But our drive is to continue to take the leadership position on revenues and at least focus on maintaining what our margins were. So Derik, I think when I look at our guidance, I know that you've brought that up, is we're raising our earnings guidance from where we were. We had a strong quarter, and we expect we're going to have another -- in that guidance, you can see another good quarter coming into the fourth quarter. So we feel pretty good about that.
Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. And just a little bit of commentary on the Indian market. Obviously, there's a number of changes that are sort of going on in the regulatory landscape in India in the clinical trial space. I know you've made some changes over there recently to right-size your organization. I guess can you talk about how much of a headwind is India to the business?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes. Actually, let me talk a little bit about the environment. I think people will know that the regulatory environment is certainly, to use a phrase, tricky over there in India, and it is impacting our customers' choices. Interestingly, I see our customers going in a couple of different ways around it. Some are continuing on because unfortunately, the burden of disease there is so great that the belief is that there's a long-term need in that country. And so some are continuing on. And then others, of course, like some of the public agencies like NIH and some others, are pulling out. We've really haven't done anything significant in terms of reductions. In fact, you may know that we have a couple of thousand people there, and we have the leading data management capability in the industry, leading pharmacovigilance capability in the industry. And we have a real strong services capability associated with what we do. So now there are some areas of our business that we've decided to exit for the moment such as the Phase I facilities base business in India. However, that is not a material piece of our business there. So I'm actually kind of excited about the services capability that we provide out of India. And as you're seeing the evolution to things like risk-based monitoring, the fact that we have such deep skill and such strong management in that country actually provides us competitive advantage in terms of being able to globally support something like risk-based management with high-quality resources from India and then other parts of the world. So Derik, not a material piece of our business. We're following our clients on the clinical side where we're getting great service support for the rest of our business.

Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with Raymond James.
Alexander Y. Draper - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But maybe just a little bit of a slight different angle on the sole-source provider. One of my question, Tom, is when you think about your broader discussions with your customers today compared to where they were maybe 2 or 3 years ago, I mean, this case clearly the sole-source provider wants you guys to get deeper. But is that trend where the customers are looking to you guys, are more willing to give you more not just outsource more but actually have more intellectual conversations, maybe give you guys more flexibility to do things differently, is that changing at all from where it was 2, 3, 4 years ago?
Thomas H. Pike
Well, Sandy, I think you hit the nail on the head. If you really look at these, they are about making improvement to the development process and improving the probability of success. And these are the kind of relationships we want. We don't -- these aren't preferred staffing relationships per se. Certainly, they result in that, but they're not preferred staffing relationships. They really are about using Quintiles' capabilities. I mean, we have 800 docs and another 800 Ph.Ds., and we have the deepest skills in the industry. And you're seeing this general flow of talent out of some of the large pharmaceutical firms and into our drug development expertise and into our process expertise. And so frankly, the customers want to take advantage of it. That's really what drives the sole-source piece of what we do. And I expect based on the discussions that we're in, I expect to continue to see these types of deeper partnerships because there's a such a need to improve the effectiveness and development in our industry. And frankly, this is something that we spend -- our leaders spend a significant amount of their time on, is trying to make sure that we're bringing the best practices and proving the probability of success for the customers. And the customers are responding. So appreciate the question.

Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
This is Vijay in for Ross, and I think most of the questions have been asked. I just wanted to ask maybe one sort of follow-up on the earlier question on Expression Analysis and sort of your announcement on the pre-profiling of cancer patients. Can you maybe give us some color on sort of what you hope to achieve, like how are you going to monetize, I guess, this data set? And what do you think is the long-term opportunity there?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, the most important thing for us is that if you look at the number of drugs in the pipeline that have some kind of genomic aspect to them, oftentimes, you'll see a number that's north of 30% associated with that. And so as the industry leader, we really have to figure out a way to get genomics into clinical trials in an effective way. And so you take something like the pre-profiling, one of the key things for me is that if you want to create efficiency in our industry, you have to think about before the development process, during it and after. And what I mean by that is that you're creating efficiencies in terms of building communities in advanced with key patient groups, and then you're actually improving the development process itself, the creation of protocols, the actual process, making it efficient. And then afterwards, you're collecting effective real world data. Now in this first category of things, we're excited about our ability to bring a genomic capability and pre-profiling capability because as you can imagine, if your drug is targeted towards a certain mutation, you get tremendous efficiency by being able to find those patients quickly and then being able to seek approval based on that subpopulation in the high responding rate. So when we look at that, we think that we're doing a service for the industry, and we think that we have the ability to create an important service line moving forward. I have to tell you, it's a subject, you can tell, that I'd love to talk about it. I think it's one of the most exciting things that we're involved in. So we think that effort will be good for the industry and good for the company.
I think that we're complete now in terms of time. We're a little bit over. Thanks for joining us on today's call. We feel confident in the ability of Quintiles to drive profitable growth and to assist in delivering better health care outcomes. We look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you, all.
