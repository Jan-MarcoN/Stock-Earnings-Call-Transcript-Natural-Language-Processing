Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Praxair first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.
I'd now like to introduce your host for today's program, Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast.
I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors Section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
In addition, please note that sequential comparisons include non-GAAP adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation, and the press release.
Matt and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results, including the current business environment, and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter, Praxair delivered earnings per share of $1.43. This result was in the middle of our January guidance range despite an incremental $0.03 headwind from weakening foreign currencies since our last earnings call. Negative foreign currency translation impact has been quite significant, both in the magnitude and speed of devaluation. In fact, several global currencies had reached 10-year lows against the U.S. dollar.
While we can't predict where future rates will go, we will continue to protect the business through strong contracts and prudent investment decisions. So, we'll experience short-term swings in reported earnings but still generate long-term enterprise value.
Looking around the world, general industrial activity is still muted as certain growth areas like India and the United States are mostly offset by deceleration in China and recessionary conditions in Brazil. Furthermore, the very strong U.S. dollar and weak commodity pricing has created challenges for certain U.S. industries specifically energy and metals producers, who are now running at fairly low utilization rates.
The customers that we serve are being impacted by these economic headwinds, and thus are affecting our growth rates. Despite these challenges, we are taking actions to preserve our profitability today and position ourselves for highly accretive growth for the future. We continue to manage cost and drive productivity, as evidenced by our 30-basis-point operating margin expansion this quarter. We are successfully raising price, especially in higher inflation regions such as the 6% improvement we achieved in South America.
We are closely managing the balance sheet to maximize free cash flow, as can be seen in our year-over-year working capital improvement. And we continue to win new business for future growth and density improvements, such as our recently announced long-term supply contracts for U.S. Gulf Coast ammonia project and the CNOOC refinery and petrochemical project in China.
So, while the macroeconomic headwinds are weighing on our current reported earnings, we continue to pursue density-growth opportunities while improving the quality of the business. This combination positions us well for highly accretive growth when the growth cycle returns.
I'd now like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Matt. Please turn to slide number 3 for our consolidated results. Excluding negative foreign currency translation impact and cost pass-through, sales grew 1%, operating profit was steady, and earnings per share grew 4% year over year. Sales for the quarter were $2.8 billion, and organic growth of 1% year over year came primarily from price attainment.
Overall volumes were comparable to the prior-year quarter, as growth from new plant startups, as well as higher volumes to refineries, healthcare, food and beverage, and manufacturing customers globally was offset by declining upstream energy demand and weaker steel demand.
Sales grew 1% from the fourth quarter from higher pricing, primarily in South America and Europe. Sequentially, volumes decreased 3%, including the typical seasonal impact of Carnival and Lunar New Year as well as impacts from upstream energy and metals end markets.
Operating profit was $623 million. Excluding currency impact, operating profit was steady with the prior-year period, as higher price, productivity gains, and acquisitions were offset primarily by lower volumes in South America, as well as prior-year quarter benefits in Europe and South America that did not repeat.
We are seeing positive traction from prior-quarter cost actions and ongoing cost control, which expanded the EBITDA margin 100 basis points to a record 33% and the operating margin, 30 basis points to 22.6%. Net income of $416 million includes the benefit of lower interest expense.
During the quarter, we repaid $500 million of 4.625% notes that became due and issued $750 million of notes with an average tenor of 13 years, and an average rate of 2.45%. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains stable at 2.3 times.
Earnings per share of $1.43 increased 4% year over year excluding negative currency translation impact. EPS benefited from a 2% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased $191 million of stock net of issuances. About $800 million remains available under the current authorized share repurchase program.
Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 12.6% and return on equity was 29.6%. Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract grew to $2.1 billion and is comprised of 21 projects.
During the quarter, we signed new long-term contracts for plants in North America and Asia and started up plants in Asia, South America and Europe. Geographically, our current backlog is about half weighted towards North America, about 25% in Asia and the remaining 25% for customers in Europe and South America. These projects will serve a diverse set of end markets including energy, chemicals, manufacturing, electronics and metals.
Please turn to slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.5 billion, 2% above the prior year quarter excluding negative currency translation and cost pass-through. Volume growth of 1% year over year in North America includes modest growth across all three distribution modes: on-site, merchant and packaged gases. Acquisitions of packaged gas distributors contributed 1% growth.
On-site volume growth of 2% year-over-year was driven by strong sales of hydrogen to refinery customers and included spot sales made possible by Praxair's innovative 2.5 billion standard cubic foot high-purity hydrogen storage cavern. This growth was partially offset by lower onsite oxygen sales to metals customers who have been impacted by the lower price of commodities, and strength of the U.S. dollar.
North America metals end-market sales are down 8% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially. North America merchant volume growth year-over-year was modestly positive as growth in the U.S. and Canada was largely offset by Mexico energy-related sales.
The reduced liquid nitrogen sales in our oil well services business in Mexico is a continuation of a trend of lower oil production by Pemex that began in the second quarter of 2014. We expect to lap this year-over-year impact next quarter.
U.S. packaged gas organic sales were steady year-over-year as higher price and moderate gas growth was offset by volume declines in hard goods. U.S. packaged gas transportation-related sales remain strong while end-markets such as metal fabrication, machinery, and energy were weaker.
Mexico packaged gas volumes grew mid-single digit year-over-year, and Canadian packaged gas volumes remained steady. Sequentially, overall North American volumes declined 2%, primarily due to lower sales to metals and energy end-markets.
Price in North America was steady, as low single digit merchant and packaged gas price attainment was offset by lower prices for hydrogen co-products that are indexed to natural gas, primarily steam and carbon monoxide. From what we are seeing, the price environment remains positive overall in North America. Utilization rates for liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen remain at about 80%.
North American operating profit was $379 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter excluding negative currency translation impact. The increase in operating profit was driven by higher volumes and acquisitions. Segment operating margin was 25.3% above the prior year.
During the quarter, we announced our largest-ever individual project with CapEx of approximately $400 million to add hydrogen and nitrogen production capacity and extend our U.S. Gulf Coast pipeline systems approximately 46 miles from Texas City, Texas to the Freeport, Texas area. We have included a map on page 13 of the slide deck in the appendix.
We signed a 20-year agreement to supply approximately $170 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen and 2,000 tons per day of nitrogen to an ammonia complex being built by a new entity formed by Yara and BASF. The supply to the complex is expected to start in late 2017. Praxair won this project given several advantages that the customer valued. First was our creativity. As we initially proposed the project to Yara, our joint venture partner in Scandinavia, who then invited BASF to participate as a partner and host.
Secondly, was our ability to capture, process and store by-product hydrogen generated by multiple crackers that are being installed on the U.S. Gulf Coast, including the strength of our relationships and reliable operating history with the ethane cracker operators.
The Yara/BASF site will be connected to our existing network of hydrogen and nitrogen production in the region including our hydrogen storage cavern, resulting in even stronger reliability. This unique project not only meets our disciplined growth criteria, but also positions us for future opportunities by extending our supply network down to Freeport, Texas. The pipeline activity of U.S. packaged gas distributor acquisitions remains healthy. The targets are smaller and the timing is dependent on the circumstances of each individual distributor.
Now, please turn to page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $326 million, 18% below the prior year quarter. Ex-currency and net divestitures, organic sales growth was 1% above the prior year, primarily due to price attainment in all countries. Sequentially, organic sales were steady as overall price increases were offset by volume declines primarily in the energy end-market.
Operating profit was $62 million, and the operating margin was strong at 19%. The business continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage with minimal volume contribution due to ongoing productivity, cost controls, and price. The prior year quarter included credits from the recovery of energy costs in Italy of about $5 million.
For the remainder of 2015, assuming at least stable to modest volume growth, including new plant startup contribution in Russia, we expect to continue to see at least a high-teens operating margin percentage that reflects continued solid operating leverage with constant focus on fixed costs and productivity.
Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $401 million, 2% above the prior year quarter, ex-currency. Strong price of 6% year-over-year included significant recovery of high inflation in the region. While South America volumes declined 5% year-over-year, the business again outperformed estimated quarterly industrial production of negative 7%.
Application-driven volume growth from healthcare, food and beverage, and environmental customers was more than offset by lower volumes to manufacturing and metals customers. Sequential volume decline includes the seasonal impact of Carnival.
Operating profit in South America was $85 million, down 5% from the prior year ex-currency due to the prior-year quarter having included a gain on an asset sale in Brazil.
During the quarter, we started up small plant serving the oxygen needs of a specialized food and drink packaging manufacturer, a customer of Praxair's for almost 20 years. The SÃ£o Paulo state-based customer uses Praxair's oxygen in glass furnaces resulting in enhanced combustion, improved efficiency, as well as reduced nitrogen oxide emissions, enabling them to increase productivity and improve their environmental performance.
And while the economic environment is currently challenged in Brazil as the government implements fiscal controls, these measures should be positive for the medium- and long-term. With a stronger balance sheet, the government will be better positioned to invest in needed infrastructure projects and will have ample ability with its current 13% interest rate for reductions to stimulate growth.
Regardless of macroeconomic conditions, we remain diligent in preserving the quality of the existing business. Our local employees are constantly adapting to current conditions and have implemented price actions supported by strong existing contracts and are delivering productivity and controlling cost in a highly inflationary environment.
At the same time, we are successfully winning new business with application technologies in less cyclical end markets such as healthcare, food and beverage, and for environmental purposes such as waste water treatment. The end result is positioning the business for highly accretive growth when any recovery does occur.
Please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Asia's sales for the quarter were $371 million with organic growth of 1% year-over-year. We continue to see strong double-digit growth in India given the improved economic environment driving base business growth. In addition to incremental growth from new plant start-ups, primarily to metals customers. China volume growth from new project start-ups was partially offset by weaker sales to metals customers. Sequentially, volumes declined 4% which included the seasonal Lunar New Year impact. Price was steady as increases in Korea and India were offset by continued price pressure in China.
Asia's operating profit of $69 million decreased primarily due to the impact of a plant sale in the prior quarter, partially offset by lower costs, and productivity gains. During the quarter, we started up plants to supply chemical customers in China. In addition, we signed a long-term contract to provide industrial gases to the China National Offshore Oil Company, CNOOC, a Fortune Global 100 company, and one of the largest in China. The project, expected to start up in 2017, will enable the reliable and efficient supply of industrial gases for CNOOC's refinery and downstream chemical production. Praxair will build, own, and operate two 2,400 ton per day air separation plants in the Daya Bay Chemical Industrial Park located in Guangdong, China. Praxair's product line plants will provide oxygen and nitrogen to CNOOC to support the company's refinery expansion.
In the park, Praxair currently serves CNOOC's existing ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol production, plus six other customers. These plants further position us to supply new customers to the park via pipeline. The project is consistent with our continued efforts to build out density in regions which we believe makes us more competitive.
Our result for surface technologies are shown on page 8. Surface technologies sales for the quarter were $160 million, 2% above the prior year, excluding currency, due primarily to stronger demand for aerospace coatings and higher pricing.
Operating profit of $28 million increased 2%, excluding negative currency impact, with operating leverage on improved organic sales growth and cost control.
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to slide 9. We are revising our revising our full year earnings guidance to now be $5.90 to $6.15. You can see in the upper right of this slide the key drivers to the guidance reduction from January. The majority of this adjustment, or $0.20, is due to the updated foreign currency translation impact. You can see on the left side a graphic showing the change in some key foreign exchange rate projections since January. Basically, one-third of our global revenues between Brazil, Europe and Canada are anticipated to have twice the currency headwinds as initially estimated. All in, we're projecting the year-over-year EPS impact from foreign currencies to be about $0.64, or a 10% headwind. However, we continue to take actions to mitigate this impact. So, while the translation impact will vary up and down, our cost management and price efforts will provide earnings improvement going forward. We also continue to incorporate currency risks into our project investment opportunities, thus preserving our future returns.
In addition, we are also making a $0.05 to $0.15 guidance adjustment related to lower volumes in the metals and energy markets. Lower oil prices have had negative impacts on both upstream production, as well as the industries that support them. U.S. steel producers have experienced lower volumes from a combination of lower tubular demands to energy, and increased imports due to a stronger dollar. These are cyclical markets, so we've seen this before. However, we continue to work with our customers to help make them more competitive in these market conditions. Our updated annual guidance anticipates EPS growth of 4% to 8% excluding foreign currency. So we still expect to grow underlying earnings mid- to high-single digit in this environment. We reduced our sales guidance to a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion. But we also expect capital expenditures to drop to $1.6 billion from a combination of management actions and weaker currencies.
For the second quarter, our guidance range is $1.40 to $1.48. This range includes an estimated currency headwind of 11% year over year and 2% sequentially. So, in summary, we are managing the things within our control. I'm pleased with the efforts of our employees around the world to drive productivity and pursue price improvements which improve our business quality.
We are also continuing to invest in our core geographies in opportunities that meet our return criteria. All of these actions provide significant earnings growth potential as macro conditions improve. Until then, we will continue to leverage our strong free cash flow to repurchase stock during this harvest cycle.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Your question, please.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
When you think about your volume outlook for 2015, the 2% to 3%, I'm trying to get a gauge of how underlying demand is. Is some of that growth from new projects, and does it kind of suggest that base volume is kind of flattish? Is that the way to look at it?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, Mike, you may recall in the last January call, we had laid out about a 2% to 3% project and sort of 1% to 2% organic. And that came to about a 3% to 5% outlook. What I would say we're seeing now is while there might be some slight delay in the projects, they're still tracking pretty close. And what we're seeing on the organic side is really the on-site is a bit softer. And that's primarily in the metals, which is causing some impact on the top line. There's just less molecules going out in the metals customers.
So that's causing that growth to be a little bit subdued. And on top of that, you still have the continued headwinds in places like Brazil, where we have negative 7% industrial production. So, volume there continues to be challenged. So, those are probably the two drivers that are causing our outlook to be a little softer on the organic.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Right. And then just â if you step back a little bit and think about maybe 2016 a little bit early, but just sort of the longer-term backdrop for industrial gases. Clearly, the growth rate this year is below what you initially hoped. What are your thoughts longer term? Do you still think this is an industry that will â can generate some good growth and maybe where do you think Praxair can really get back on track as you head into the outlying years?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I definitely think we can continue to generate good growth. I think the challenge we're facing now is we've got multiple headwinds. We're seeing sluggishness in emerging markets, we're seeing sluggishness across the entire commodity space, so specifically energies and metals but even mining is still very weak. And frankly, you're in a disinflationary environment with governments across the world constraining their spend, so infrastructure spending is quite weak and has been quite weak. So I think all these factors are hitting right now, which are creating just a myriad of headwinds for us. But when I look in the outlook, especially the medium to longer term, I think these things will turn. They are cyclical in nature, and I expect them to turn, and that will give us some good growth. And when we get that growth, it will be highly accretive. We're going to keep these cost savings that we have. We're going to keep the price actions that we've taken. So, when this growth does come, it will be highly accretive and it will drop heavy to our earnings.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Good morning. Actually this is Matt Andrejkovics calling for Vincent. Just wanted to ask, was there anything inherent in the first quarter that enabled you to meet the midpoint of the prior guidance but that might be absent for the balance of the year, thus resulting in the reduced guidance?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. There was no special items if that what you're referring to, or nonrecurring items. In fact, we probably had a little bit more severance in the first quarter here given some of the cost actions we're taking. That was a slight headwind.
Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, in Europe, can you indicate how much of the volume weakness was energy's? I guess we would have expected, and it seems like you got some volume benefit from the currency decline?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So yes, in Europe, the primary energy sales are related to our offshore business, called Dominion, and that has been quite weak. That was, frankly, one of the first areas to get hit by low oil as most of the customers they serve are rigs for things like diving gases and other type packaged gases that go on the rigs. So as those rigs have slowed or been idled, we've seen a pretty significant drop in that activity. Excluding energy, I'd say in Europe, it's been slightly improving. We did have one outage called a standard chemical outage in the first quarter here that's going to be starting up here shortly. But we are seeing some improvements in metals, in areas of Southern Europe, we're seeing a little bit of uptick in some of our package gases.
So, while industrial production is slightly positive to slightly negative in areas like Southern Europe, we are seeing some signs of improvement, and that's something we'll continue to hopefully see going forward.
Matt Andrejkovics - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your question please.
Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Adam Seiden for Duffy Fischer.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I was just â I guess, Matt, Kelcey. So, over the course of the past several quarters, the number of projects in the backlog has gone down, but the total backlog amount has been increasing. So, with the large downspin in Q1 in the U.S. likely resulting for the higher dollar amount, I was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics of the backlog and for the international regions, about how many projects have started up in the past quarter and if there were any cancellations or delays?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. So, we've had a handful start-ups. We've got one project that I'm viewing as inactive right now that we're sort of addressing and working with the customer. And then, we had a couple that we've added, as you mentioned. And what we're seeing right now is the projects are just getting larger. So, the best activity still is the U.S. Gulf Coast and certain parts of Asia as far as â and specifically China, you're still seeing some opportunities there. So, the two large projects we announced, one being the ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast, is really taking advantage of the low cost hydrogen by-product sources that are being generated from ethylene crackers, and we're able to get in the middle and make that deal happen. And therefore, the ammonia customers can essentially build a very low-cost solution that doesn't need to handle hydrocarbons.
And what you're seeing in China is with the rising demand for transportation fuels, CNOOC is making some expansions of both the refinery aspect, as well as some of the downstream PetChem to be able to take advantage of those growth areas. So these projects are larger. The project on the ammonia was both processed gases and atmospheric gases, and they tend to require more capital, and they're more in some integrated complexes. So while they are lumpier, they do take longer to sign and execute, but they are going to be quite accretive. So that's sort of the trend that we're seeing. And on the other side, we're seeing much smaller projects for things like environmental, food, beverage, and they tend to be very small on-site plants. Those are also doing well. I'd say it's kind of the middle-sized plants that we're not seeing as much growth right now, especially in some of the regions like South America, and areas in Europe.
Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.
That's very helpful. Thanks. And I guess just separately, in India, it's been a very strong growth avenue for the company. With new plant start-ups helping to drive growth, so I was just wondering if you could touch on the underlying growth that you're seeing in India going forward, and how we should think about that cadence of growth through 2015 with the JSW, ASU looking like it could possibly start up.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So there is clearly a lot of momentum and just positive views in India right now, which frankly is a stark opposite of Brazil. But this momentum in investor confidence is really causing more interest and opportunities to make investments both brownfield and greenfield. India is a big recipient of the low oil as they're an importer of hydrocarbons. And they are taking a lot of steps to be more pro-business and business-friendly.
So, the combination of all that coupled with these known infrastructure needs and growth needs that India has, I think is pretty powerful combination that's making it more attractive for investment. Now, we'll have to see long range, if these trends continue, but we're seeing a lot of confidence in our customer base. And we tend to see more opportunities there both on on-site and liquid credit opportunities.
So, we'll keep our discipline. We'll keep our same investment criteria we keep around the world. But there is some optimism there and the momentum seems to be quite positive.
Adam Marshall Seiden - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your question, please.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Sure. Thank you. On slide 14, I'm surprised that chemicals are down 7% year-over-year. I didn't think we had that much of a weakness and downtime and lower operating rates. Is that just Praxair specific, did you just get unlucky in terms of your mix of customers?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, John, a substantial portion of that actually is natural gas. And maybe I can explain it because it not only impacts this part of the slide, but it impacts the price in North America as well. So, the way we look at natural gas is anything that's related to hydrogen direct sales, we call pass through. And as you know, natural gas dropped 30-plus percent year-over-year, almost $2 a therm. So, anything that's hydrogen-related goes to the pass-through line. Anything that is related to co-products, from a HyCO steam methane reformer such as steam or CO or methanol, that we put to volume and price. Specifically in this case, price. So, that is all wrapped into that chemicals.
As you know, these end markets show a combination of price and volume, but exclude pass-through. So, that actually has a natural gas impact to the co-products, the pricing impact. And that's a substantial portion of that drop. The rest of it are some outages. We had an outage in Europe, an outage in the U.S., and one in Asia, and those are coming up here in these few months here, and one is already up. So, we do expect that to recover back, but you'll see this natural gas sort of pricing co-product impact until we lap it.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
And then secondly, for the on-site metals customers. Are many of your customers near their take-or-pay minimums at this point, or is there still further room to fall to get to minimums on a lot of the business?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, we have a handful in the U.S. and a handful in South America right now that are below take-or-pays. So, we are collecting the take-or-pays, but their volumes have dropped below. In Asia, there were a few but that tends to tie more to the Lunar New Year impact. We tend to see this seasonal impact. But in both U.S. and South America, we are seeing a handful in both on the metal side below that number.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, Matt, Kelcey, Liz. How are you?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good. Morning, Sam.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Morning.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
A follow-up on the last question regarding the â hopefully this is a silly question, the take-or-pay contract structure in the developing markets, what's the susceptibility worst case of being hit by some sort of a force majeure or a legal equivalent? I would imagine it would be low if for no other reason as your share of wallet's low and the critical nature of supply and the inability of some of your competitors to undercut you on a subsequent bid because they don't have the assets in place, but â has that happened in the past and how susceptible do you think you are, worst case, in that environment?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, I think, Sam, that really comes down to strength of contract and how you define force majeure in a contract. And our language is fairly clear, and force majeure is not economic. And what you're seeing across all of these situations are economic, right? It's supply-demand driven. It's pricing of things like hot rolled or what's going in their individual markets. So, we don't have concerns in this. We are getting paid, like I said, and these are economically driven. If there is a clear force-majeure situation, then we will work with our customer on that, and if it meets the definition and criteria of the contract, then there will be some relief. But at this point, none of these are force majeure situations, and there's no expectation that they will be.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And can you remind us what your take-or-pay mix is in the developing markets?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
We've never provided that, but I can say this. Every on-site contract we have, there's some form of either fixed facility or take-or-pay structure that we will apply.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And last question before I defer to others, you mentioned, Matt, management actions around CapEx, not just taking it down because of FX. I'm guessing that's more on the maintenance side. And if so, what would you â if things don't change between now and next year, what would you anticipate for CapEx to be next year?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, when I say that around management actions, we're taking a very holistic look across our entire spend rate, not just what hits the P&L, but also what hits the balance sheet. And maintenance is part of it, small growth CapEx, so that could be transportation assets, storage assets. In light of sort of the current environment we're in, we need to be very, very prudent on how we allocate capital and not just related to big projects, but to small capital expenditures as well.
So, we've got fairly large efforts under way to manage that. And when looking forward on CapEx, clearly we signed two large growth projects, so we're going to need to do some up-front spending for equipment ordering on that. And then in about a year or two, we'll start getting some on-the-ground expenses related to them.
But I'd say the number from a large perspective is going to be contingent on how many large capital projects we announce here. The kind of management actions we're taking could be a couple hundred million here or there on what we'll call the smaller growth and maintenance aspect. So, at this point, I'd still see it in this range of kind of $1.5 billion to $2 billion depending on where the large project timing spend is.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just had a quick question on the updated guidance, you talked about kind of having an incremental $0.05 to $0.15 range from the impact of the lower oil and metals. And I was wondering if you could maybe give a little bit of a breakout, kind of between the two and what the scenario for the low-end versus the high-end looks like to you through the rest of the year?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, Ryan. I would say, high level of the $0.05 to $0.15 range, probably two-thirds I would attribute to metals. And that's mostly U.S. related and how I would quantify the U.S. piece is, there's really two components in my mind that are impacting that. The first is the lower sales for tubular goods, and that's being impacted by the significant drop in energy. So that's â tubular goods going in upstream, midstream.
And the second piece, which is frankly to me almost seems like a bigger piece right now, is the U.S. dollar impact. So as you've probably seen, imports of steel is up 20% to 30% in the U.S. In fact, I believe a third of the current steel that's being used in the U.S. is imported. So that's creating some pressure on production in the U.S., and that's also impacting some of the volumes from the customer side.
The one-third that's energy, while we did anticipate some of the, what I'll call direct upstream impact, which would be our nitrogen going downhole for fracturing. The piece that this more ties into is the secondary impact on manufacturing, metfab and some of the other ancillary industries that were supporting this very broad-based energy across the United States. And we're seeing that slowing in both our package and merchant businesses. So that's how I'd quantify, kind of the other third. But that's just a rough split right now.
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. And then just kind of a follow-up on that, on that metals piece, it sounds like the imports issue is a big piece in the North American weakness. And do you get the sense that you're not going to be able to make that up kind of in other parts of the world? I know you called out the metals weakness, I think, in each of the geographic segments.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, it depends obviously where it's coming from. And we are seeing some strength in Canada. Some of these imports are coming from Turkey, which we're not present in. So it just depends on what part of the world is importing. We are seeing some strength in India. We're seeing some strength in Canada. And we'll need to see out here in the next few months.
Ryan L. Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you very much.

Matt, I was hoping you could talk about your competitive advantages and disadvantages in the Gulf Coast hydrogen market and your capabilities once the expansion is complete in 2017.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So we have the strongest hydrogen network when you take the access of pipeline plus the hydrogen storage cavern, and we have a very strong blend of both on purpose hydrogen production and byproduct hydrogen production. So we'll now be extending that from Texas City down to Freeport, which will give us additional opportunities all along that pipeline to be able to branch off for future projects both for sources and for sinks of hydrogen.
And on the atmospheric side, as you know, we also have a very strong atmospheric network extending throughout the Gulf, and that will also be extended. So we'll be able to bring the full complementary process in atmospheric gases with a very strong backup network and ability to deliver very high-pressure, high-quality product at very short swings and intervals that are needed by our customer base.
So that gives a very strong and unique advantage, and we'll be able to continue to branch off this network for other opportunities between that whole Texas City and Freeport corridor.
Mike J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC
All right and turning to Brazil, kind of a series of questions. In your mind, has the economy there hit bottom? Can you maybe talk about what trends you've been seeing in the manufacturing and metals markets since Carnival got over with, and we got back to work? And maybe just give us your thoughts on the political situation. I know a lot of us thought that the elections would give us some closure and maybe some stability no matter who won. Now we have some continued issues, so to speak.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So I would say there's a whole bunch of interrelated issues going on in Brazil, and frankly, I don't know if it's hit the bottom. We'll see. It definitely feels pretty low right now. The negative 7% was pretty steep here for this quarter. But when I look at some of the factors that are driving the headwinds, I think some have improved, and some are kind of still at the same level. So, for instance, if you start with the energy, there were serious issues around the hydroelectric production. There was a very, very minimal amount of rainfall, and that was putting a lot of stress on the government balance sheets as they were subsidizing. Now those subsidies are starting to roll off. There's a bit of inflation in that market, but they have gotten some rains. They've seen a lot of less consumption of electricity in the industrial sector, frankly, given the low production environment. So, that situation seems to be working its way out, which was one of the headwinds. It's still not out of the woods yet, but that aspect seems to be working its way through.
Another issue, as you know, that came right after the election, was the entire Petrobras scandal. That has put a renewed headwind on activity not just around Petrobras, and I would say the overall confidence in the environment. But Petrobras is a very large consumer of goods across the whole country. So, this has had a knock-off effect on their suppliers and the local economies they work in.
So, that's been a bit of a drag. Now that they seem to be getting some progress, they are working to get out their financial statements. And the more that gets resolved, I think that will help rebuild some of the confidence, and we can get maybe back to some production. But other than that, volumes are still weak on anything that's industrial, anything that's manufacturing. Auto is very weak, noncyclicals are still doing well, food and beverage and healthcare.
So, we're â as I mentioned before, below take or pay on a handful of steel mills, so it won't get worse in those steel mills. And if we can see any amount of growth here, it will be quite accretive, but we're not going to bank on the growth, hence why we're making sure we keep our cost in line. And we're definitely raising price to stay ahead of this inflation.
And remember, that price will keep. So, the currencies will recover at some point. In fact, they had been recovering from the sort of low of 3.3 BRL/USD, it's now in the low 2.9's BRL/USD. But this price we will keep. And we just have to get ahead of it, and that's what we're looking at. So, I'm not going to bank on a recovery, but if it does happen, it will be quite accretive for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson. Your question, please.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Thanks for taking my question. With respect to your uses of cash, you've guided your CapEx budget a little bit lower here. And I'm just wondering about share buyback intentions going forward. Do you expect to maintain this pace of buybacks that you had in the first quarter or should it be a little bit higher?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, James, as I can keep making more cash freed up from my free cash flow, I'll use that for buybacks. So while I'm â we did lever up a bit this quarter, but first quarter is our weakest cash flow quarter in general just based on timing of tax payments and other payments. But I'm looking for the full year to keep my debt roughly consistent on a net debt basis. So, what that means is every dollar that I'm able to get back from either working capital or CapEx, or out of operating cash flow in general, I will use for buybacks.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Very good. And secondly, on your merchant utilization rates, I think you did mention the North America region. Could you also fill us in on utilization rates in the other regions, and your outlook on those for the rest of the year?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, so as Kelcey had mentioned, U.S. low-80%s, and argon, we're still seeing fairly tight at mid-90%s, moving to South America, we're about mid-80%s which may seem somewhat surprising given the conditions down there. But you need to remember that the merchant liquids tend to go into a lot of the non-cyclical pieces of business and they're doing well. So while the on-site volumes are quite challenged in Brazil, the merchant business is still doing fairly well.
When you move to Europe, on average, we're low-70%s. We're seeing a little bit of improvement in the south. North is fairly stable, but more weakness in areas, especially Scandinavia. That's having some economic impact from low oil.
And when you go to Asia, we're around mid-70%s. Korea is still doing quite well, I'd say mid-80%s. We did add some capacity to India, so that's getting absorbed, so they are stepped down in probably the low 70%s. And China is in that low-70%s area as well, as Chinese New Year tends to be, during this quarter, a slower point on merchant consumption. So, that's kind of around the world. We've got plenty of capacity to sell more molecules when the demand comes. We're clearly not looking to add any more merchant capacity. But this is how we're operating right now around the world.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Robert W. Baird. Your question, please.
David J. Manthey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. Matt, when you look at the list of available productivity enhancement programs at the company, are the opportunities today still as plentiful and meaningful as in the past? Or after many, many years of excellence in productivity enhancement, is it hard to find significant business functions that are run sub-optimally today?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
I think there's â David, there's always opportunities. It's just the opportunity set sometimes will shift with what's going on in our end markets that we serve. So, for example, the main elements of productivity, if you sort of put them in buckets, you'll have efficiency of use of our input cost, so that could be natural gas, that could be power. You'll have efficiency in our distribution through our logistics efforts, so that's more efficient routings, saving things like diesel fuel, hours of drivers, and then you'll have just your general what I'll call overhead costs, the people and their associated costs to maintain the businesses.
So, when you see challenged environments like this in lower energy costs, you may not have as many opportunities to go after the low-energy cost side simply because the return on those projects become less, right? The capital you put in, the returns are not as great at low energy. However, you see strong opportunities in both the overhead as well as the distribution cost because as our merchant routings change with demand, we need to make sure we're constantly optimizing them to be able to save the most money.
So, I would say they don't go down as much as you think. They just shift, and our focus shifts. And another big area for opportunity, frankly, is going back to all of our suppliers and taking advantage of this low-commodity world. We buy commodities, too, whether it's steel for our plants or whether it's other type things that we use in our production processes. We go back across our whole supplier chain, and we also go to try and get productivity initiatives around the procurement. So, they still exist. You're seeing them in our results. You're seeing our margins expand, and I'm not concerned that the opportunity set is dwindling in this environment.
