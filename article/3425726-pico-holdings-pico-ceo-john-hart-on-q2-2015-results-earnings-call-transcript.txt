John Hart
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. As you have seen from our press release, it was a disappointing quarter with a net loss of $49.8 million or $2.17 per share. Importantly, however as announced, we closed on the sale of Northstar Hallock on July 31st. The sales price is $127 million which after all closing adjustments for working capital, and as a closing cost resulted in a loss of $16.9 million in addition to the operating loss for the second quarter as $8.8 million.
After all transaction cost to be booked in the quarter, PICO will net approximately $22.6 million in cash from the sale. While there were good reasons for investing in Northstar when we did it, and the management team performed well under difficult circumstances, it turns out to be a terrible investment for our shareholders, and I'm sorry for that. The entire Northstar investment over July including all associated transaction cost resulted in a decline in book value of $4 per share before any tax loss impact which if we are able to book in the future, we estimate such impact to be a positive $1.40 per share. Based on our estimate of intrinsic value, the decline approximates to 13% before the potential $1.40 per share tax benefit.
In the second quarter we also recorded a net of tax write down of our investment Mindjet of approximately $18 million. The write down reflects the fact that our investment is now further down the waterfall on any monetization event due to additional funding Mindjet has required in the third quarter which we decline to participate in. Reversing in net of tax positive adjustment to estimate a fair value of $15 million we had previously recorded, when our original investment stake was merged with Mindjet in the third quarter of 2013. In the wake of Northstar and Mindjet, our Board has been engaged in urgent total and holistic review of our capital allocation and investment decision and criteria. Simply put in whether significant value to be harvested in our company, we have not been performing. We know this, email this, and we need to fix this.
Before strategic review concentrates on PICO's remaining subsidiaries, UCP Inc. and Vidler Water Company, which together represent 93% of our shareholders equity. While the current stock price performance of UCP has been extremely disappointing, we believe that at current levels the price is highly disconnected from its intrinsic value. The homebuilding operation has been dissipated the value of the land and doesn't prevent them from selling land. Our 57.2% holding of UCP has approximately the same book value as when they went public giving UCPs dramatic growth since going public two years ago, and the increased geographical diversity it now has, we believe the value of the company and its underlying asset should be greater today than when it went public.
The outlook is positive as to how to market continued share improve for the first six months of the year including their backlog, UCP has sold more homes than all of last year. Margins continue to improve as they realize the benefits of scale and work to improve their cost structure. Land sales which continue to be somewhat weak should also improve as homebuilders continue to reduce their buildable wide inventory due increased on sales. The UCP management team has committed to enhancing shareholder value and we are confident that they are exploring all alternatives to achieve that goal.
As for Vidler Water you may recall that in our 2014 letter to shareholders which is available on our website, we discussed at length the potential value of Vidler's assets and the drivers for increasing value. Real estate activity, both residential and industrial, and water demand and scarcity are key factors to increasing value and we remain confident in the longer term prospects of this asset. Nevada and Arizona are some of the fastest growing economies in the U.S. and are in a prolong period of drought. Recent data for northern Nevada shows an increase in new single family home sales year-over-year and medium values of new single family homes have also increased for the same time periods. All in all, we are pleased with the trends and optimistic about the attended value creation in the Vidler asset.
Before we take your questions, I'd like to finish by saying that while we believe we can generate meaningful value with our remaining assets, we understand your frustration with our performance. Our Board heard you loud and clear at the Annual Meeting and the same results in a very clear message. We are moving with urgency to maximize the value to you of our assets, and it is our intention to pursue monetization and as they occur, our media priority will be to return value to you in the form of share repurchases. In the near future, our Board will be reaching out to you to discuss the same and get your thoughts. We are also planning an Investor Day for this fall and will send the save the date notice soon.
This concludes our quarterly update, thank you for your attention and patience. We will now open the call for questions and of course, you can always call Trish at 858-652-4130 to schedule a call if you would prefer to speak further.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Weil of Tier One Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, John, how are you doing?
John Hart
Hi Chris, good, how are you?
Unidentified Analyst
Good. So obviously, one of your shareholders put a letter out on Friday and I think it had some pretty hard things to say in it. But instead of talking about the parts that are hard, let's just go with the parts that I think probably everybody is on board with which is monetization and return of capital. One question I have for you is, the share repurchase will work just fine for small amounts of cash but if there is really a major monetization, this is a practical matter, doesn't it make sense to think in terms of a share tender?
John Hart
Well, I think there are a number of alternatives we can consider to affect our share lead purchase, whether it's through the open market or through a tender offering. And those are all things that we would consider and really look at what would be the most valuable and the most effective return to shareholders?
Unidentified Analyst
Is it safe to say that if there was, if you had enough cash that share repurchase through open market was obviously going to be too slow that you would pursue some other avenue like a tender or special dividend?
John Hart
I think depending on the amount of capital available, a tender offer would probably be more efficient than share repurchases through the market because there are certain limitations that we would have and affecting all the market purchases. So it really depends on the situation, the amount of funds that we have available at the time.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Well, that's all I have, and thanks for taking my question.
John Hart
Thank you, Chris. And again, if you have any follow-up questions please feel free to call Trish and we'll be happy to speak further.
Operator
The next question comes from Taylor Finch of Century Management. Please go ahead.
Taylor Finch
Thanks for taking my question guys. I was curious about what progress is being made, maybe monetized or UCP asset or maybe some of your other non-core assets? And are you actively making plans to turn these into cash?
John Hart
I'm sorry, Taylor, can you repeat that last part?
Taylor Finch
Yes, are you actively making plans to turn your non-core assets into cash?
John Hart
With regard to UCP, yes, we appreciate it, they are an independent public company. So we are limited as to what we can say other than - again, as we've said publicly, we feel very confident that management at UCP is exploring all alternatives for creating shareholder value. With regard to our other holdings, we always evaluate our holdings, Mindjet is a good example where we decided to not continue funding, providing funding to that operation. Other holdings that we have other than UCP and Vidler are pretty small. If they are a stage where it's appropriate to liquidate them we would clearly do that, St. Bonicks [ph], I think its $2 million there. There is still very much in a growth phase, it doesn't require any capital from us, it's probably considerably early in their lifecycle for us to consider selling them. So it really has handled on an individual basis.
Taylor Finch
Okay. With regard to UCP I understand that they are separate company - you're kind of limited in what you can say there, but maybe we can just talk about your interest which is controlling stake in UCP. Could you monetize a controlling stake in UCP in some way, either an outright sale to another party or how do you think about that?
John Hart
You're referring to outselling our shares independent of any transaction that the company can itself might perform?
Taylor Finch
That's right, since you hold the controlling stake.
John Hart
We could sell our shares to someone else but under a shareholder agreement that would require the approval of UCP's Board of Directors, independent Board of Directors.
Taylor Finch
Okay, understood. And then last question for you guys, we think Vidler is a pretty good business and these assets are certainly worth a good deal being more in what they are being carried under books for. From your share price though it's not clear that the market is seeing that, what can be done to illustrate their value and why not sell off a couple of pieces to demonstrate what these water rights are worth off?
John Hart
Well, it's always difficult to speculate on why your share price has reacted the way it has but it's probably safe to say that that's a reflection of the negative results we had in Northstar. And also the uncertainty that Northstar created in terms of its ongoing cash flow needs. We have tried to provide considerably more information on the data points that are useful for helping to determine the valuation though as the water assets, all the assets are available - ultimately market demand will determine the timing of monetization. Potentially we could accelerate that but it would be a bit extensive of what we're our evaluations than will just be unnecessary. I think the thing to really track that's important is where is growth occurring in those markets, what stage are you in that cycle, the quality of that growth, and particularly in northern Nevada, it looks like it's pretty early days for transformational growth in that community. So there - although there is a sense of urgency to demonstrate the value of those assets, we have to balance that with leaving too much money on the table. So that's an exercise again that we go through continuously but everything is for sale, so to the extent that we have credible offers and there are at reasonable valuations, they will be considered.
Taylor Finch
Okay. One more if I could on that, I guess to the extent then that we can demonstrate the value but we know that the shares are severely undervalued, this comes from what I've been reading the letter that was posted on the SEC website last Friday. We really agree the share tender being a really good rout, so to be able to do that with a lot of cash, I mean what - either what kind of sources of cash do you think you can tap in reasonable amount of time to make that occur? What options do you think you have on the table there?
John Hart
I think the only option would really be cash from monetization's.
Taylor Finch
Alright, thanks guys.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Eric Sperin of Bert's Foundation [ph]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi John, thanks for taking my question.
John Hart
Hi, Eric.
Unidentified Analyst
John in your annual letter you spoke about the value of Vidler being or you said in access of 2.2X book value. This morning you served you spoke about what you thought the value of UCP was relative to its value at its IPO but is there anyway to be more specific on what your opinion of value is just to demonstrate to the market? Potentially how cheap that answer would be as a percent of your total?
John Hart
Well, the comment that I made with regard to their current value of UCP, really have to deal with since the time of the IPO. On an accounting basis their book value is for the most part unchanged. Since the time of the IPO there has been tremendous improvement in terms of the organizations ability as a homebuilder, they have a platform now that when you look at their pace of deliverables, this is much more advanced than it was two years ago. Also as we've seen in the recovery, a gain of little bit of traction, clearly the land is worth more than book value in aggregate and that's really what I was referring to.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. But nothing more specific in terms of filling a yardstick out that you find that the market should grab onto in terms of UCP value relative to book or anything else?
John Hart
No, they have excellent analyst coverage and again, our comment is if you look at the current share price relative to their book value and the book value is probably understated, that represents a pretty reasonable opportunity.
Unidentified Analyst
Sure. Thank you, John. I appreciate it.
John Hart
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Bill Gordon of Gordon Capital. Please go ahead.
Bill Gordon
Good afternoon. Can you add a little clarity in terms of this concept that UCP is an independent company with independent Directors, exactly, can you narrow that a little into what percentage management there owns anything and where we are in terms of ownership? In other words, it's unclear to me.
John Hart
What I'm referring to is, even though we own 57.2% of the shares, they are an independent private company that has to follow their public company which has to follow their own corporate governance requirements and their Board, particularly the independent members of the Board have to act in the best interest of UCP shareholders, not PICO shareholders. So although we can speak as PICO shareholders on behalf of our shareholding we can't speak for UCP.
Bill Gordon
So another, what I'm hearing from you is that, if we own 99% of this company and Vidler they own 1%, they control the operation, we have nothing to say?
John Hart
I can relate it further specific shareholding in our amounts, I mean your example, I'm not a securities lawyer and I suspect the situation would be very different if you did on 99%.
Bill Gordon
Well, we own two-thirds of the company, it's the same - if doesn't matter [ph].
John Hart
Right, I understand what you're saying but under securities law, corporate governance, UCP Directors have to act in the best interest of UCP shareholders.
Bill Gordon
I see, okay. One last question, on your release that you used - send out moments ago, you mentioned that our objective is to maximize long term shareholder value, we manage the operations from a long term standpoint, to achieve superior return from a long term basis as opposed to short term earnings, it reads well. You've been at this now five years, all I've seen is if this has been - you managing short, giving up short term for long term, well we're very superior in managing long term whenever that shows up but so far we're just been bleeding out over these years, I haven't seen what we've accomplished in almost area of this company. I don't understand how this is going to change here?
John Hart
Well, we agree Bill that our performance has been unsatisfactory and the majority of our access are carried at book value and that's not reflected in our results and our results had been impacted primarily by what has been a very bad investment for shareholders which is Northstar. And our focus is on continuing to preserve but also enhance the value of our UCP and Vidler, and that includes monetization events in a timely fashion.
Bill Gordon
Mr. Hart, we've had a tremendous turn in housing in the last five years, this land bank has gone up tremendously and value from 2008-2010 in California, we've got very little out of it, we've bleed and we've converted over the home stick building so that hasn't worked any important to me, so for the first quarter I've seen the light of day. Vidler Water, how did they come out in California or in Arizona with Tesla? And there again, nothing is shown up. When are we going to wait - next millennium? When had to wind it all back and nothing showed up?
John Hart
Again Bill, I can just tell you that with regard to land values in California, we do believe that they have depreciated since relative to the caring values. We have not seen a robust market in California. UCP has certainly willing to entertain any reasonable offers for the land that they have, there is nothing preventing them from selling the land and with regard to the water assets, everything is for sale and to big step that we would get a reasonable offer, we are more than willing to consider that. Things do look very encouraging, I agree, northern Nevada, particularly Tesla, it is one of probably a hundred new businesses that are relocating to that region. So we agree that the future does look quite encouraging with regard to those assets. Thank you, Bill. We appreciate your questions.
