Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Melissa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to DIRECTV's First Quarter 2015 Earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Martin Sheehan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Martin J. Sheehan - Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Melissa and thank you everyone for joining us for our first quarter 2015 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; Michelle Locke, CFO of DIRECTV Latin America and Larry Hunter, our general counsel.
In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first I need to read to you the following: On this call, we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Martin, and thanks for everybody for joining us today. Before I review our Q1 results, let me just start by reiterating that I fully expect this will probably be our last earnings call as a separate public company.
In reiterating what AT&T said to the Street a couple of weeks ago, I am very confident that we will be able to close our transaction in the second quarter.
On a related note, I was also pleased to see AT&T increase their expectations for annualized cost synergies to $2.5 billion. I think that fact just really helps demonstrate how strategic this deal is for both companies and why I was comfortable on behalf of our shareholders receiving AT&T's stock in the transaction so that our shareholders would have the opportunity to participate in further upside value creation driven by these synergies.
And I might add, I strongly believe there will be significant incremental revenue growth opportunities with unique new bundle offers as well as numerous cross-selling possibilities, which should further increase shareholder value once our two world-class management teams get to operate as one company.
Needless to say, we at DIRECTV are really excited and looking forward to the time when we can start competing more aggressively as a new unique national mobile, broadband and video company that is truly world-class.
Lastly, let me just take this opportunity to briefly thank all of you, our investors, for your support over the past five and a half years. Since I became CEO, our number-one focus has been driving shareholder value and serving our customers. And if I take a look at our stock price, I'd like to think we've made some good progress on the shareholder value creation front.
I think it's important to point out that the reason for our success, though, really goes back to our DIRECTV people. So let me just thank all of our DIRECTV employees for all their hard work, dedication, their creativity and imagination to make our business what it is today over the past five and a half years and even beyond that. Those are the folks who have truly made this a great company as well as, I think, a great place to work. And at the end of the day, I certainly believe that â and I think Randall does as well â that the most valuable assets AT&T is buying is truly our people.
So with that, let me turn to our first quarter results. DIRECTV and PanAmericana, especially when you exclude Venezuela, had solid first quarter results beating both external and I might add, our internal expectations. Our main headwind in the quarter, as you saw in the release, was Sky Brasil where significant depreciation in the real as well as some billing system migration issues caused a drag on our consolidated results.
Starting with Latin America, as is the case with virtually every other global company that I watch, we've seen increased volatility in the global currency markets this year, which has presented significant foreign exchange headwinds for us particularly in Brazil and Colombia in the latest quarter. As such, we've increased our focus on our strategy to manage these countries in local currency by ensuring smart pricing with inflation, particularly in the high inflation countries, also maintaining a keen eye on costs so we can protect our margins and reviewing all of our capital expenditures carefully, particularly those that have to be made in U.S. dollars to ensure that each investment will generate a solid and attractive return.
Particularly due to the challenging foreign currency and macroeconomic environment, I have to say I was really delighted with the results of our PanAmericana team and our other segment when excluding Venezuela where we drove both strong local currency and U.S. dollar-based revenues and even better OPBDA growth, improving margins 260 basis points. In addition, we reduced capital expenditures by around $35 million in the quarter resulting in nearly $90 million improvement in cash flow, ending the quarter in positive territory at PanAmericana.
Obviously, the main headwind in the quarter was Sky Brasil, where a 22% depreciation in the real put incredible pressure on our dollar-based results. That pressure was compounded by issues surrounding the implementation of a new billing system which Bruce will touch on in a bit more detail in a moment. So whereas the real depreciation certainly pressured our dollar based results, it was billing system issues that caused most of the revenue and margin shortfall in the quarter. And as we said in February, and I still believe, we should be out of the woods on most of these issues by the end of second quarter and, by the way, making good progress in the second quarter and are also putting in place plans to recapture the lost margin in the second half of the year.
Now, I think it's important to point out that our strategy to attract customers in Latin America from both the high end and mass market segments continues to drive very strong demand, as DIRECTV Latin America added 1.1 million gross adds in the quarter, similar to a year ago, led by a record first quarter in Sky Brasil.
And in addition, our advanced product churn rates in Brazil are at levels that continue to generate strong returns, even in a challenging economic environment, while PanAmericana post-paid churn rates remain amazingly near all-time lows due to our strong brand as well as our outstanding product and service offerings. So although we still need to complete our system implementation in Brazil, our long-term confidence in the growth potential of these markets continues to be high.
Moving on to DIRECTV U.S., I thought our first quarter results were very, very solid and continue to reflect our overarching goal of attaining high-quality subscribers while also managing our top and bottom lines so that we can achieve long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
Specifically, we believe our enhanced focus on the quality, loyalty and profitability of subscribers is increasing the long-term value of our subscriber base and yielding stronger financial returns and you can see that when you look at the percentage of our customers that were low risk in the first quarter and that the same way you can look at percentage of customers over $60,000 a year in income were very, very strong. These benefits are particularly also evident when you look at the fact that we had our lowest first quarter churn rate in six years while at the same time delivering 6.1% revenue growth generated mostly by our ability to grow ARPU and add high quality subscribers in a continuingly challenging U.S. macroeconomic environment.
And although this year's OPBDA growth for the quarter is lower than our usual goal, our use of refurbished equipment as well as lower set top box costs are showing up on the cash flow line, as we stick to our algorithm of mid single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit cash flow growth before interest and taxes for the U.S. business.
I think it's also important to note that these results come in the face of a significant amount of effort by countless folks here at DIRECTV and our counterparts at AT&T to prepare for the close of our transaction, and not just on the staff side. Teams that are preparing for all of the things that have to be done to close the books, provide a seamless transition for employees, but more exciting, I think, on the operations side, as we think through new offers, new service models, and provide a seamless transition for our customers. So overall I think a very solid quarter for both our U.S. and PanAmericana businesses and I do expect a stronger second half of the year from Sky Brasil. So with that let me turn the call over to Bruce.
Bruce Barrett Churchill - Executive VP & President, DIRECTV Latin America, DIRECTV
Great, thanks, Mike. As Mike said earlier DIRECTV Latin America had mixed results at the start of 2015 with solid results in PanAmericana but challenges to performance at Sky Brasil.
Starting with Brazil; so during the first quarter we faced a challenging set of circumstances. First there was a 22% depreciation in the Brazilian real year-over-year along with a weakening economy. In addition, we implemented a major phase of our billing system migration and to be frank it did not go well.
These two factors combined to reduce revenue, increase churn and negatively impact expenses. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the challenges facing the Brazilian economy. Weakening currency, higher inflation, lower demand for natural resources from China, a consumer debt overhang, Petrobras et cetera. So I'm not going to belabor these points, but I would like to take a few minutes to expand on our billing system issues.
During the quarter we discovered a number of bugs which resulted in the billing system not communicating properly with the customer care and conditional access systems. These bugs were not identified during the testing phases and only came to light as we were migrating a large number of subscribers to the new system.
In addition, it took our team and our outside vendors over three weeks to fully stabilize the systems. A combination of our inability to properly process payments, handle collections and reactivate customer signals in a timely manner led to a one-time loss of revenue of over R$100 million in the quarter. In addition the need to handle significantly higher call volumes resulted in higher churn, higher bad debt and higher subscriber services expenses.
Now, the good news is that the systems have been largely stable since late February. And the entire Sky Brasil team has been focused on cleaning up the backlog in customer care issues that resulted from these events.
In addition the team has a plan to recover the lost revenue and operating profit before depreciation OPBDA, and we are expecting our full year performance in local currency to be in line with the guidance we provided on the last call. As you can imagine, the impact of the callback plan will not happen all in one quarter. So you will see our results improve with each consecutive quarter during the remainder of the year.
In relation to sales, we continue to see surprisingly strong demand in Brazil with record first quarter gross additions of 589,000. Of particular note, we doubled the number of new customers who took HD and HD DVR equipment in the quarter and have now surpassed 40% advance product penetration of our nearly 5.7 million customers.
In the future we will further segment our offers driving more customers who struggle to pay their bills to a prepaid model which should result in lower churn from these subscribers and lower delinquency. Also in Brazil our broadband business had a terrific first quarter and brought in net additions of 47,000 subscribers, bringing us to a cumulative subscriber total of 153,000 in Brazil. We also continue to see nice cross benefits with the video business in terms of improved gross ads and lower churn in those markets where we offer broadband, as approximately 75% of our broadband customers are bundled with video.
Moving on to PanAmericana, they had a very strong quarter, and to be clear, my comments below will all exclude Venezuela. So beginning with subscribers, we surpassed the 5 million subscriber mark with 117,000 net additions. This was down from last year's 194,000 mainly due to lower gross additions, as last year we started to see the run-up in new customers in anticipation of the World Cup. Meanwhile, postpaid churn remains low at 1.55% while total churn improved 8 basis points due to our strong prepaid reconnects during the quarter.
In PanAmericana, local currency revenues increased 33% driven by a 9% increase in the subscriber base and a 22% increase in ARPU mainly driven by price increases in Argentina. The Argentine peso depreciated about 13% year-on-year and the Colombian and Chilean pesos depreciated at 23%, and 13% respectively. In spite of those significant currency declines, on a dollar basis revenues increased 19% and OPBDA nearly 34%, improving margin 260 basis points to about 24.5%.
It is worth noting that our Venezuela business continues to perform well when measured on a local currency basis. It's still a business with almost 2 million subscribers, a 48% market share, less than 1% churn and high operating margins. So wrapping up on PanAmericana, we're very pleased with the overall results in Q1 and PanAmericana is on track to deliver solid top and bottom line growth both in local currency and U.S. dollars consistent with what we discussed last quarter.
And as usual, I would like to mention Sky Mexico whose results were released by Televisa a little over a week ago. Sky Mexico delivered another strong quarter adding 129,000 subscribers in the quarter bringing their cumulative subscriber count to nearly 6.8 million. Financial results of Sky Mexico were also strong with roughly 9% growth in local currency revenue and 10% growth in OPBDA.
And finally, in light of the fact that this is probably the last DIRECTV earnings call, I would like to thank the investor community for their interest and support of the DIRECTV Latin America story over the last 10-plus years. I admit it's not always been an easy story to understand and certainly I would like to have gone out on a stronger note.
But bottom line, when Chase Carey and I first spoke to you on October 11, 2004, about the series of deals that created today's DIRECTV Latin America, we had pro forma fewer than 3.5 million subscribers on the three platforms and pro forma revenues of less than $1.3 billion. Last year the three platforms had revenues of almost $8.4 billion and with the results we just reported today, DIRECTV Latin America now has almost 19.5 million subscribers, within spitting distance of my colleagues in the United States. So all in all, not a bad run.
Again, thank you from all of us at DIRECTV Latin America for your attention over the years. And with that, I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat?
Patrick T. Doyle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Bruce. DIRECTV U.S. delivered yet another quarter of strong results as both our financial and subscriber performance exceeded our internal expectation. Beginning with subscribers, DIRECTV U.S. net additions of 60,000 were driven by the lowest first quarter churn rate in six years of 1.37% as well as continued strong gross additions.
Similar to the fourth quarter, gross additions were aided by strong performance in our consumer electronics distribution channel as well as continued strong demand for our HD DVR which accounted for over 70% of gross additions. The low churn was driven by higher customer pay rates brought on by the combination of our continued focus on attracting high-quality subscribers and improving macroeconomic conditions including lower gas prices. In addition, we continue to see strong results from our customer winback programs. We believe these programs attract valuable customers back to our service as these programs provide targeted offers to our former long tenured customers who had a good payment history.
Shifting to our financials, revenue growth was also ahead of our internal plans at 6.1% driven by a 5.5% increase in ARPU as well as a modest net subscriber gains over the last year. The key drivers of our ARPU growth were our annual price increase which was one of our highest ever, the introduction of a lease fee on new customer's first set top box, as well as higher advanced receiver fees in part from increased HD DVR penetrations. In fact, we surpassed the 12 million mark for customers HD DVRs and the 15 million mark for subscribers with HD equipment.
ARPU also benefited from a 12% increase in ad sales as we saw growth in all categories, national, addressable and direct response. Continuing recent trends, addressable ad sales yielded strong results, increasing 32% compared to the first quarter of 2014. In addition, commercial revenues continued to grow nicely increasing 10%.
Moving, now, to the bottom line OPBDA performance was better than our internal plan, although growth was a modest 1.1% in the quarter. Programming cost increases were the biggest factor weighing on growth although we did benefit in the quarter from a settlement of a prior year programming dispute. The settlement kept our average programming cost per subscriber under 10% in the quarter at roughly 8.3%.
Also impacting growth was higher subscriber acquisition costs which increased $55 from a year ago to $914 per subscriber. The increase was driven by a combination of factors including a 20% increase in higher quality subscribers coming from our higher cost consumer electronics channel, a 12% increase in new customers taking our more expensive HD DVR equipment and higher ancillary equipment costs that go along with HD DVR installs.
In addition, roughly $10 of the SAC increase was driven by our new LifeShield Home Security service. Most of this increase impacted the P&L as dealer costs and ancillary equipment are expensed. Similarly OPBDA growth was impacted by an increase in upgrade and retention expense that was mainly from the increased success of our winback program, although a reduction in Genie upgrades, as well as lower box cost lowered our capital spend in the quarter keeping the category spend roughly flat from a cash perspective.
With regards to our full year U.S. outlook, our first quarter performance has us right on track in terms of growing revenue in the mid single digits, OPBDA low single digits and cash flow before interest and taxes high single digits. Regarding subscribers, our larger than average price increase, as you might expect, has impacted churn more than last year although lower than we planned. This fact, combined with our other ongoing offer changes, will likely weigh on subscriber growth this year, especially in the seasonally low second quarter.
Looking quickly at our Q1 consolidated results, adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding the Venezuela devaluation charge in 2014 declined to $1.44 in the quarter mainly due to the decline in OPBDA at Sky Brasil as well as a $50 million pre-tax decline in our below-the-line income recorded in other net on our P&L.
This change was mainly driven by the impact of the depreciating Brazilian real on our dollar denominated liabilities in the country. However, free cash flow, one of the primary metrics we focus on, increased 5% to $927 million in the quarter as the lower OPBDA was more than offset by favorable timing of working capital, proceeds from the settlement of a swap contract, lower cash tax payments and higher interest income due to the higher than average cash balances.
Turning to our consolidated outlook for 2015, based on the first quarter results, our expectations for modest free cash flow are unchanged. In addition, as of today, our outlook for about $6 of full year EPS would only be impacted by differences in actual foreign exchange rates with those that we laid out for you in February. So with that I'll turn the call back to Martin.

Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys, thanks, you caught me off guard. Two things, one, if you could talk about the programming dispute resolution where would the growth have been there? And second, I was surprised to see churn so strong, given the fairly large price increase. Can you sort of expand on the winback efforts there and what else is going on in churn? Thanks.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Phil. Look, I'm not going to get into the details of the settlement. Suffice it to say, it didn't move the programming expense growth rate that much. I think for the full year, I think we had said maybe double digits. We may be a touch below double digits; in fact, we probably will be, I would say, for the full year, but still on the high side of the historic range we said of 7% to 9% and that is driven by a significant reset primarily from the Disney contract. So we feel very confident in terms of where we're at in managing those expenses and we certainly expect this year to be the high water mark in terms of programming expense growth. So I'll leave it at that. Pat, I don't know if you want to touch on the churn thing.
Patrick T. Doyle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, on churn, so the 8 basis point reduction that we saw year-over-year in churn, 6 basis points of that 8 basis points came out of involuntary churn. And we saw that trend in the fourth quarter. It continued into the first quarter. Generally we see some favorable activity there with refunds and other things. But there's definitely, as I said, we think there's some macroeconomic, we think the lower gas prices are definitely helping. On voluntary, like I think we said, we really â the team did a great job of really identifying customers on winback. We look at that very carefully to make sure that we're getting the adequate return on the investment in winning back customers. Clearly there were some disputes in the early part of the quarter that probably maybe some people that might think about switching providers, didn't. But the big drivers were macroeconomic and our winback program.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC
If I can follow up, I mean, it seems like â it seems a little, maybe a little silly, given where we are in the merger dynamic, but you tightened credit down pretty aggressively over the last couple years and I would think that's part of the involuntary getting better. If you were here over the next few quarters, do you think you could open that up a little bit now that you're seeing sort of what the impact is?
Patrick T. Doyle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You know, we â I mean, there isn't a month that goes by that we don't sit down and analyze the quality of the customers that came on, their performance over periods of time, and that's where you really saw our tightening last summer. I think we had made some changes on opening up some stuff that clearly wasn't paying back for us. So the answer is, yes, absolutely. I mean, we will continue to look at all of our cohorts, and if we see the right kind of return coming out of cohorts that we've tried to filter out, we would definitely expand them if we saw that happening.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's a delicate balance, Phil. I mean, I think we did make some changes, particularly last June on our credit scoring based on kind of the revisions that we had to our long-term value model, and you see that in the first quarter. As I said the quality of the subscribers, to deliver 60,000 net ads and at the same time our low-risk subs was like 73% versus historically in the mid 60%s, percentage over $60,000 was almost 50% from the low 40%s. We made a lot of progress. Having said that, I think it's always a delicate balance because you can have too much of a good thing. So we're always kind of looking at the knobs, but we do it with a very rigorous long-term value model that we look at, by channel, by type of credit score, and make those decisions accordingly.
Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you. Mike, I wanted to get your thoughts, while we have you still on the bundle from here, you've been a big advocate for more flexibility and choice for consumers, so I wanted to ask you a couple things. One, the entertainment and select tiers you put together, can you talk how successful or not successful those have been?
And do you think the programmers are becoming a little bit more flexible lately when they've seen changes in the landscape around distribution requirements? And the last piece is when you think about your set top platform, particularly Genie, could you integrate over the top services into that over time like Netflix and others? You've had that pop up on a couple of earnings calls, so I wanted to see how you thought about that from a technology perspective.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Thanks, Ben. First of all, I think I've been pretty outspoken in believing that consumers want more flexibility and choice and frankly should have it. I think our industry, particularly, I would say around sports, regional sports networks, in particular college sports networks, you know, honestly, I think those things should be a consumer choice or not. But having said that, the industry is the way it is today. Most industry contracts typically have a fair number of restrictions in them in terms of what you can do. Now, we'll see with Verizon's approach. I'm certainly happy to see someone drawing attention to the issue of giving consumers greater flexibility, but we'll have to see how that works out.
Having said all of that, and I â so I'm glad you brought up the entertainment SELECT. Look skinny bundles, if you will, isn't something new for DIRECTV. Frankly, we got on this case, I don't know, I'm going to say about a year ago when we dusted off our kind of low-end entries. And we've got over 1 million subscribers now that are taking entertainment in SELECT. It's a little less than 7% of our residential subbase. And we're quite happy with it.
Now, given penetration rates and so on and so forth, we manage it very, very carefully and very explicitly but we feel like we've got a good value for customers. The lowest one even at full rate is about $49.99 for 130 channels. So we certainly believe that is a good place to start. I also think, to be honest with you, Ben, you would think differently, I would think differently, if I was selling Internet. I will be, or we will be post our deal, in which case even skinnier bundles may make sense as really an integral part of a broadband strategy.
So I think the programmers have become a little more flexible. I think reality may be settling in. And I think in the end, it's awfully hard in today's world to not provide consumers what they want with some flexibility. I'm not a believer that we ought to go all the way to a la carte, but I do think the system has kind of gone too far the other way at this point.
And lastly, in terms of Genie, absolutely. I mean, I think you've seen us put up Pandora, I mean, the Pandora app, which I love on DIRECTV. There was no reason why we couldn't put other apps up. Now, I'm not going to comment on Netflix. You start to get into kind of rights issues and things like that, but from a technical standpoint, and particularly, again, in a world where we're going to sell bundles we are looking at opportunities to put more things as an app onto the set top box.
So we've built that capability, we started it with both YouTube and with Pandora. I'm not sure the YouTube thing will continue because they're trying to do something different to control the whole experience themselves, I guess. But I certainly think that opens up opportunities where it makes sense. Again, we have a very profitable premiums business that I don't want to cannibalize, but we're not close minded on anything in that regard.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC

We'll take our next question from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. First of all, just going into churn on retention a little bit more. With the retention spend down or basically flat, and you indicated in the release that promo offers were up, is this a mix in strategy shift or just the usual quarter-to-quarter shift in the balance between offering upgrades versus retention discounts? And second, if you could just give us a sense of your view on the value of sports programming to consumers as a whole, and particularly given your experience with the Dodgers network and the like that, do you think there is a large group of customers out there who would have essentially very little willingness to pay for sports and how do you think they're best addressed? Thanks.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Yeah, the first one, I think the answer is no on the first one, James, but let me let Pat talk to it.
Patrick T. Doyle - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, and one of the things to keep in mind when you look at the upgrade and retention spend on the P&L, a lot of what we do â I mean, that's part of retaining customers. If one of the issues is that they may be considering leaving because of their experience in their home, then we try to get them the right experience in the home, if that's an upgrade to Genie or whatever â whatever the issue is that they're dealing with. A lot of our retention is really in the save area and trying to right size their bill or to maybe downgrade them to the packages if it's a value issue.
So a lot of those credits will show up in revenue as we try to save customers. And I think I might have mentioned on the last call, I feel better than I ever have that we've really got a very good science in evaluating the return we get on customers and certain cohorts of customers of using tactics that allow us to try to not overspend on saving customers and also not spending a lot of money on customers that really have a low propensity to churn and you would otherwise be spending money on customers that aren't going to leave you. So it's nothing new although I will tell you within, I would say, probably the last year with some technology we've put in, we are very, very much better at making sure that the retention spend is a good return on investment.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I wouldn't say we changed strategy much in the quarter, to be honest with you. I would say we did make some tweaks to our strategy after third quarter last year, but nothing further since then. So on the sports programming topic, look, I think it's a paradox, James. I think you know very well, if you look at any of the highest rated programs, most of them are NFL games. I mean, there's no doubt that sports, particularly live sports, continues to draw massive audience. I mean, we were thrilled with the results of the fight, pay per view; we had over a million buys at DIRECTV. It was a record for us. We had some challenges getting everybody through but we did get everybody through, we were ready to go by the end and we learned a lot out of it, but we just blew the doors off in terms of sales, which was nice because it will help the second quarter.
But I don't think you can kind of just say one thing or another about sports programming. Look, I think in the case of the Dodgers, frankly at this stage it's probably for AT&T to make a decision, but it was a reckless deal at many multiples of what was being paid before, well above what anybody else would have bid, and then they tried to force customers to pay for it.
We had very minimal churn last year, I think something like 2,000 customers which was a pittance and we got like half of that this year. I think the â in my view we made a very fair offer last year; it was rejected out of hand by Time Warner Cable. Frankly, now that we haven't lost any customers the channel is probably worth less to us today than it was a year ago. But I have to say I think it's when the â when you abuse customers by overpaying for stuff and then try to jam them, which there's a lot of in this industry, whether it is for a college network or whether it is for a regional sports network, I think what we've learned out of our Houston experience and our Los Angeles experience is, you know what, customers don't care that much. And so, I think it behooves all of us to be more responsible when we're striking these deals with sports teams to recognize that there is a limit beyond which customers will go.

We'll take your next question from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great, thank you. I wanted to touch base on competition and so forth. Now with the Time Warner deal sort of falling apart, do you think that's going to make the competitive situation a little bit more difficult rather than what it's been, has that been what sort of helped with the churn recently, how should we think about that and then how has your market share fared on the commercial side the last few quarters, are you gaining or losing share and do you think you can accelerate that with AT&T?
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
This is a very, very competitive industry, first of all, and as Pat said on churn, 6 basis points of the 8 basis points was involuntary, which I suspect had less to do with competition and more to do with just the overall kind of environment for our kind of customers that have the hard time paying the bill, shall we say. So and if I look at it by the â we found the cable guys much more competitive, DISH is much more competitive, I mean, it's a very competitive industry. And I don't think there's anyone out there that I've seen that isn't very aggressive, you see a lot of them now doing 24-month fixed-price offers which with rising content costs is kind of crazy in my view, but you see it.
But I don't think that it'll change the dynamic, because I think it's been a very competitive industry and will continue to be that as we go forward. So, I don't really â I mean, look, we're all out there battling every day with new products, better services and so on and so forth. I'm just particularly proud of the DIRECTV folks for the technology that we bring to the market, for the service that our folks provide and for the branding work that our sales and marketing team does.
In terms of commercial, we had another great quarter. I mean commercial has been a real bright spot for us I think now for a couple years. We put in place a new management team over commercial a couple years ago under Mike Wittrock. They've been delivering double-digit growth. I think it's over $1 billion dollar business now for us, so it's an attractive business. And when I looked at kind of the breaks between bars and restaurants, hotels, and so on and so forth, it's pretty much across the board.
I mean, there wasn't one segment or whatever; it was pretty much all of the segments grew in the quarter. And I expect that we'll continue to be able to expand that business. And I think particularly when we think about the kind of business-to-business relationships AT&T has, which we haven't really had access to at this point, I have a feeling there's an enormous opportunity for us to find more synergies there.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys, thanks. Mike, just maybe a quick comment on how you sort of view the video product going forward, I know you were talking earlier about over the top skinny bundles, but if you were in AT&T's shoes and you've got broadband in a certain part of the country and no broadband in other parts, how do you view sort of app space TV versus nonapps? And how would the strategy differ between those two areas?
And then I guess secondly for either Mike or Bruce, thinking about Latin America, is this â I'm assuming it's not a product issue, there's a lot of macro headwinds obviously in this quarter you've got, or previous quarter you've got the billing issues and whatnot, the systems issues. I'm just trying to think strategically how important LatAm is in the overall scheme of DIRECTV, whether you're getting significant scale benefits or other things we should be thinking about. Thanks.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I wouldn't presume to speak for Randall, Mike. But our joint teams have been doing a lot of work on envisioning the product of the future, and they've got some really exciting stuff that I think we're really kind of in the middle of the river working through.
I think certainly as a company that has a world-class mobile business, you can fully expect they're going to mobilize everything. I think you can certainly expect that we are going to try and take TV Everywhere, all the way to the promise land, to deliver on the promise that we made several years ago that has been difficult for the industry, I think. I can see a future not too far out there where you're going to see a lot more exciting stuff of â your ability to watch stuff on any device you want.
I think when it comes to over-the-top skinny bundles I think that still remains to be seen. As I said, certainly if you think of razors and blades in a world where you're selling a profitable broadband product you probably have an incentive to do more over the top even if it's digital pennies and not all that attractive financially.
I think when you get outside the footprint I think that's an open question in my mind still. I mean, I think in the industry you're seeing a lot of experiments of different ideas and everyone is well aware that consumers would like skinnier bundles. It's not at all clear to me that it's just an over-the-top product is going to be all that attractive financially a proposition if you're not selling broadband, but who knows? I mean, I think we'll see, we're all watching, and goodness we've got our little experiment with Yaveo which is Hispanic programming.
So, the technology is not a barrier from our standpoint and I think the right discussions have evolved quite a bit. I think it's more what is an intelligent way to service the customers that are perhaps broadband-only homes today, and I think we all agree that everyone would like to find a way to service those customers to at least give them a taste of the ecosystem and then be able to upgrade them when they eventually want to watch Sunday football. But I think it â you have to be very careful about that or you're going to have a massive cannibalization of your low-end customers, and I think that's the watch out. But...
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
Mike, I think you mentioned â sorry, I think you had mentioned on the prior earnings call that you sort of tempered down expectations on sub ads and sort of a different topic, but what are the thoughts now on the full year's looking to 2015 on U.S. subscriber ads?
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, as you know Q2 is always a seasonally low quarter, that's why Pat mentioned it, so I would guess we'll be net negative for the quarter like the rest of the industry, but for the full year gosh we're ahead of plan, we had a very good first quarter. I think we've got some great stuff for the second half of the year.
I think we all have to be careful about the low-end customers that are struggling to pay the bill. So, you know, I think that's a watch out. But I can't say that I've seen a huge increase in cord cutting. And I think we are seeing maybe some improvement in housing. I don't think it's huge, but some. So I'm still very â feeling pretty good about the full year being a touch positive.
I think it's still a pretty mature economy and the bottom 40% of America that are less than $40,000 in income still have challenges. And so I certainly don't see a robust net ad world in front of us but we'll hold our own and I continue to feel very, very proud of the way we've been able to grow subs in a challenging environment over the last five years.
Bruce Barrett Churchill - Executive VP & President, DIRECTV Latin America, DIRECTV
Mike, maybe you could repeat your question on Latin America.
Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC
I was just trying to think, Bruce, about the business itself and we hear that it's a very popular product, obviously we've got pretty strong ads, but is this just you've got some macro headwinds and as you look out over the next three to five years it's still a very attractive business? And then thinking about the benefits to DIRECTV overall, how strategically important is Latin America either from scale, buying power, whatever the case may be?
Bruce Barrett Churchill - Executive VP & President, DIRECTV Latin America, DIRECTV
Well, look, I guess I would agree with your premise that we continue to believe there's a great opportunity in Latin America. I mean, overall pay-TV penetration is still well below 50% across the region. And as you mentioned, there's still very strong demand for our product. And I think one of the successes we've had over the years that has enabled us to grow the company is our ability to serve multiple segments, which is what it takes to grow.
That does help the scale, that does partly explain the increase in the margin at PanAmericana where in some of these smaller countries we are finally getting to a place where the scale improves. I'm not sure that it has a huge impact, per se, on the scale economies of the U.S. business. It's obviously a much bigger business. But the long-term strategic of importance is obviously going to depend a lot, I think, on what AT&T's agenda is. It's clearly a fit with what we currently do in Mexico and their recent investments and it's very early days and I think we'll see what happens in Brazil and the rest of the continent.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Actually, Mike, I think I agree 100% with what Bruce said. I just would add also I think that still you have to realize the technology road map is linked between the U.S. and Latin America. There's still a lot of synergies in how we operate together and I frankly think perhaps some of our work on both over-the-top and TV Everywhere may find even more residents in Latin America as a low-cost way to provide product to consumers. And I think we surprised ourselves when we did a kind of off-the-cuff app for the World Cup and had huge take on it in PanAmericana. So I know Bruce has got the team starting to think about some of that stuff. I think there's still a lot of opportunity.
And, again, if you look at the â it's not just the penetration rates, if you just look at the rise of the middle class in those countries and, you know, you kind of look over the long haul, there's still plenty of upside for more folks to join the middle class, just looking at the demographics in Latin America. And to be honest with you, as painful as it is, it does seem like the finance minister in Brazil is doing the right stuff.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Question for Mr. White. I think it's been about three years since you renewed with Viacom, so it doesn't have near term implications to my questions. But I was just curious on your high level observations in terms of what your reaction to the sub-defections from some of your competitors after they dropped Viacom and what conclusions, if any, you've drawn from any of that?
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not going to single out any individual programmer. We've had our disputes with just about all of them, I think, in the last five and a half years from what I can count. I think certainly all of us on the distributor side are looking at what customers want. I mean in end of the day, it's talking to customers and what do customers want and I think it's been said before, if I can get the most watched channel of my bundle over the top, maybe it doesn't need to be in a bundle anymore. And so I think we're all going to be thinking differently about opportunities to help manage the price value equation with our customers.
At the end of the day, I feel a deep responsibility to represent the total of our customers in these negotiations and I think I've said that for five years. So I have no doubt that at the end of the day, if people are watching your stuff, there will be demand for it. If they're not, I think, you know, in a world where we all have to start making tough choices, I think you'll find all distributors starting to make tougher choices.

We'll take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan, your line is open; you may ask your question.
Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, hey, sorry. So just a couple from me. The first is in terms of all the programming contracts that you have, how many of them would you have right, which AT&T could basically use on their mobile platform, if any? And then also, from a programmer perspective, there are obviously all kinds of constraints on the distribution side coming from the most favored nation kind of a clause. But on the other side of it, what is it that the programmers can or cannot do as they start including some of their content in these over-the-top bundles? I mean, what are the restrictions that the distributors actually have placed on these contracts?
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not going to â I mean, all of these contracts are confidential. And so legally I wouldn't get into any of those specifics. I'm not going to comment on how our rights are structured. I think it is fair to say, though, that over the last two years all distributors have been pursuing mobile video capabilities and rights. It is a world that is evolving. I would say you've still got some challenges with local broadcasters on the big four networks because it's so fragmented, that is different when you get to national cable channels where I think you're seeing pretty much all distributors trying to really deliver on the TV Everywhere promise. And there are a number of ideas that I know AT&T has, and I'm going to leave it to them to talk about how they plan to mobilize video once our deal closes.
You know, in terms of over-the-top and MFNs, look, every single programmer has a different strategy. So, you know, they're all acutely aware of millennials, I would say we all have to do a better job of providing content that millennials want to watch, but I know when you do, you know they come running.
I mean if you just look at some of the offerings on AMC, they'll come running for that stuff. So I don't have a problem with our programmers trying to service the broadband only households and to try and ensure that they've got a product that appeals to millennials.
I think our issue is simply you cannot ask â the customers that are paying the load of these bundles to pay higher prices that you then think you're going to offer a la carte to other customers or you're going to have what happened to the World Wide Wrestling thing, which is it doesn't work out real well. So to me it's mostly about ensuring that our customers are treated fairly and, as I said, I'm not afraid of more flexibility and choice. I actually would welcome it.
Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.
All right. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.
Tuna N. Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC
Hey, thank you so much for taking the question. So, Michael, the price increases, it seems like you're suggesting that your customers are â you're passing them along to your customers much better than you had hoped, and I was wondering, , A, why do you think that's the case, and, B, is that something that you view as sustainable?
I know you've been pretty outspoken in the past about the programming increases and the ability of guys like yourself to pass these on. So I was just kind of trying to get a sense of why you think the customers are paying that? Is that a function of your shift to higher quality subs? Any color, that would be helpful.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think I was saying earlier, Tuna, first of all, I think DIRECTV has the best customers in the industry. And you see it. I mean, we tracked internally by income and by kind of credit scoring and I was looking at the first quarter numbers and they were really quite interesting. As I said, the percentage of gross ads of our customers that are over $60,000 went from the low 40%s to almost 50%. And if you look at our cumulative subs, we've got a huge percentage of our subs that are over $60,000 a year in income. I think it's 40% of the population and it's like 60% of our subs.
So we skew higher quality subs to begin with and that's been, I think, both deliberate in our premium branding, given the quality of the service that we try and provide our customers. And so I guess we probably have been able to manage through some of these price increases, but none of us should ever kid ourselves
Look, median incomes are not growing at those rates and for any business that deals with customers, consumers, sooner or later if you're going to price ahead of median income, you're going to have a problem, and I think we also shouldn't forget that we have a significant swath of our customers that tend to be rural where the satellite is the best technology to deliver the signal, and make less than $40,000 a year.
So, we still have a significant number of customers that make less than $40,000 a year and are price-sensitive. I've always said we have to be both Southwest Airlines and Mercedes-Benz in the same company given the strategy of serving rural areas well, as well as having a premium brand. I think we do a pretty good job of balancing that but I have no doubt that â and I see it in the complaints about price and about the bill, and they are up this year versus last year, just not as much as we planned. But, as a distributor, if the cost of eggs goes up, the price of eggs goes up. So we do the best we can in these programming negotiations to keep costs from going out of sight.
And that, again, is one of the reasons why I'm so optimistic about our merger, because I think the combination of the two companies will help us better manage those cost increases. But we try to do both. And I think we can walk and chew gum pretty well as a company and I think that's a testament to the folks here at DIRECTV and their flexibility and the way they innovate.
Tuna N. Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC
That's very helpful. Just separately on the merger itself, you were pretty confident on the closing and I know that with regard to â with the Comcast deal, I know it's not exactly apples-to-apples and most of us were also optimistic that the Comcast deal would close. So what is it that gives you the utmost confidence, what are you hearing from the regulators, you must be pretty certain that â that makes you pretty certain that there's no major concerns or conditions that could give you guys pause?
And lastly, Mike, I know you talked about your people being the greatest asset and I wanted to also commend you for the way that you've run the company for the last five and a half years and I don't know if this was mentioned as to possible role that you might have in the new company, is this something that you're going to be involved in or are you just going to ride into the sunset? Thank you.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, those are two easy questions, thanks, Tuna. Let me take the first one, though, and just comment briefly on the status. Obviously, we are still in the middle of the regulatory review process and we thoroughly respect the regulators. And so I don't yet have a date. And I think we have proposed â AT&T has proposed a number of commitments and I would expect that over the next several weeks we will begin to discuss conditions and understand what conditions the government believes would be required to approve the deal.
Having said that, we've been in discussions one way or the other with both the Department of Justice and the FCC now for almost a year. I think they have something like 7.5 million pages of documents, 300 white papers, testimony by a number of our executives at both AT&T and DIRECTV and we're in close touch with the regulators.
I think most importantly the Comcast deal is quite a different deal. We don't have a 57% market share of broadband and we don't own NBCU. So I think those are two fundamental differences versus their deal and I think furthermore, we feel very, very strongly that there are both significant consumer and competitive benefits to our transaction.
When I think about what our transaction will do, I think it helps consumers â where there'll be more fiber, there'll be a more vibrant competitor to cable. I think it will also enable us both to innovate in ways that we can't today. So I think there are significant consumer benefits and benefits to strengthen competition particularly around giving â one thing we know is if you want a more aggressive investment in the Internet, the single biggest way to monetize Internet is video. And so having a profitable scale business like DIRECTV with the relationships we have with our content providers, I think is a huge unlock for further fiber build-out down the road in the long-term.
So I'm very, very bullish on it. And I truly believe this is positive for consumers and will strengthen competition in our industry. As far as roles are concerned, look, I don't think we have anything to announce as of yet. But I know from the conversations I've had with Randall, we each have worked as partners over the last year in shaping our strategy around this, we both testified together in Washington, D.C., we see things very, very much alike and are both equally excited about the future of the joint enterprise. And I've been very clear with Randall, I will do anything I can to help facilitate a smooth transition and play whatever role would be helpful and I'm sure we'll have more to say on that down the road.

Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Great, thank you very much. If I could just follow up on that last question. In terms of the Washington, D.C. approval process, I thought we were waiting to hear from the appellate court, and why do you think the FCC wants to open up those contracts? Thanks.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, that's an easy question, Tom. Thank you. I actually am looking at my general counsel to my left and I'm going to let Larry take that one on and just update you all on â yes, there is a programmer lawsuit that is still being reviewed by the courts but, Larry, you want to just comment on it?
Larry D. Hunter - Executive Vice President & General Counsel
Yeah, the programmer lawsuit continues to be pending. I think the FCC explained why they wanted to make the contracts available under strict conditions of confidentiality. It probably, almost certainly isn't legally required that they do that. This was a choice. And evaluating our transaction and evaluating Comcast, the FCC can obviously change the way they consider that.
Michael D. White - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
But we've been told, you know, that, however that gets resolved may have some implications and some things to do, but that it should not be an obstacle to the FCC completing its review of the process.
Larry D. Hunter - Executive Vice President & General Counsel
That's exactly right. Because both they and the Department of Justice have had full access to all those contracts for almost a year now.
