Travis Stice
Thank you, Adam, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to rattler mainstreams fourth quarter earnings call. The fourth quarter of 2020 continued the trend of rattler normalizing operations, volumes and capital spend to a business plan with low to no growth from its sponsor down back. As a result, EBITDA increased over nine percent quarter over quarter to seventy eight million and operated capex decreased by over 60 percent quarter over quarter to 12 million. These metrics set the baseline for battler's 2021 forward outlook as Diamondback plans to maintain relatively flat production and activity levels at current commodity prices. Operating capex is expected to decline by approximately 50 percent year over year and will be down over 70 percent from levels seen two years ago, setting rattler up for significant free cash flow generation that will be returned to unitholders in the form of our distribution and common units. Buyback program, rather, is also near the end of our multiyear investment cycle and non-operated equity method investments with distributions from equity method investments nearly reaching parity with contributions in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we expect distributions from these investments to significantly exceed our expected remaining contributions. Our only remaining meaningful contributions are to complete the link to Webster Pipeline Project.
We are forecasting significant distributions from both our great Oak and OMCG investments in 2021. Looking forward to 2021 with Diamondback planning to keep a fourth quarter. 2020 oil production volumes relatively flat. Guidance reflects a continuation of the strong results seen in the second half of 2020. The stable operated business underpinned by Diamondbacks low cost development of its top tier Permian assets, along with equity method distributions outpacing contributions, is expected to deliver increase in free cash flow to rattlers unitholders this year.
In conclusion, when we created Ramla to build out the infrastructure necessary to develop Diamondbacks assets, we envisioned a midstream entity that combined conservative financial management, visibility to volumes and a clear and honest relationship with its sponsor, the low cost independent producer in North America. We still believe that each of these attributes apply today, and there's a clear advantage as that adapts its business model from accommodating growth to optimizing operations and free cash flow, which will accrue to unit holders in the quarters and years ahead with these comments now complete. Operator, please open the line for questions.
Adam Lawlis
Operator, you go over the line for questions, ladies and gentlemen.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
This time, if you were to ask a question, you will need to press as far along, are you to grasp the bounty again? That is what I want to ask a question. Please stand by. Raster.
Adam Lawlis
Brian, we're unable to hear the question. An. Yes, we're here. We're waiting on you to put the questions there.
Operator
Yes, we have a lot of questions here. First question from James Kirby with JPMorgan.
James Kirby
Just want to start dying back and made comments, you know, following the recent acquisition with Cupie about potentially dropping down, you know, the midstream assets held AQAP. Just wondering if you can provide any commentary there in terms of the nature of those assets. And, you know, that's something you're looking at in the near term or letter data growth.
Travis Stice
You know, James, good question. You know, if you if you did a really good job building out their midstream assets and their, you know, their county line area and the Mustang Springs area where they've been pretty active here for the line area and the Mustang Springs area, where they've been pretty active here for the last few years, you know, there's a lot of fresh water assets, disposal assets, recycling assets, and on top of that, some small oil gathering terminals and assets. So I think we're pretty excited about how they develop their midstream capabilities. And, you know, I think over the long term, those assets, you know, likely belong at Rattler. But we've got to do a lot of work here post, you know, hopefully closing this deal in a few weeks and then and then working up the valuation and getting two boards aligned on valuation for a potential dropdown. But it's certainly our intent. I just I just wouldn't expect it to happen in the first half of the year.
James Kirby
Got it, that's helpful and then just a follow up on the on that, when you think about financing of it, you know, leverage here below to. Do you have any early thoughts in terms of how you'd go about financing the dropdown and if that would kind of coincide with buybacks, maybe use the buyback pace in favor of the financing, the drop downs?
Travis Stice
Yeah, I mean, I think it's too early to make that call, but I think in general, you know, we're not going to cover up the company, we're not going to cover up, you know, the parent in exchange for the sub or vice versa. So I think it'll be. You know, prudently financed and, you know, I think it just depends, you know, I doubt we put more than two terms of leverage on the assets that get dropped down and the rescue fund with cash or other sources. So, you know, we've been we've been prudent and drop down financing in the past at VIPR. And I think, you know, for us, you know, keeping rala below two times because, you know, that leverage consolidates up to the parent is probably the right thing for us to do.
James Kirby
Got it. That makes sense and the nation's point of clarification. Are you receiving full descriptions from all your jobs in line with of cash flows? And do you expect those distributions to remain stable or to grow across the portfolio over time?
Travis Stice
Yeah, we're certainly not receiving one hundred percent because there is some interest to be paid at eggroll, but we're probably getting 80 to 85 percent of EBITDA there in the form of distributions on the Omaha JV. There is not a lot of debt at that subsidiary at zero right now. So we are getting full distributions of EBITDA from that business. I think we're pretty excited about the forward outlook for the Omaha JV this year. I'm very active in a few of the other producers on the system are going to grow volumes. So I think that system's going to see pretty significant growth. Now, with that comes a little bit of capital that needs to be spent, but overall, I think the distributions from those two businesses are going to outperform expectations. And then on the upside, you know, we're not expecting distributions from that business. So I think I think it's fair to assume that there's probably, you know, 10 to 15 million dollars of EBITDA leakage to what we receive in the form of distributions from the from the investments.
James Kirby
Got it. I appreciate the color there. And last one for me just to previously, you guys, Pawsey Amorello build out there and just with current commodity prices where they are. Is there any chance that, you know, maybe gets pushed, accelerated ahead and you guys start building something in this year or is that still later dated?
Travis Stice
Yeah, I mean, I think if, you know, it's still later dated, if we decide even to build the plant, you know, I think we're Pawley thinking pretty strategically about the asset and how it fits in northern Martin County. So right now, you know, no intention to spend an extra 50 million dollars to build a new plant in an area that that's probably long capacity. So, you know, I think we're going to be we're going to be smart with Pawley capital there.
James Kirby
Does that make sense? I'll stop there. I appreciate calling guys.
Travis Stice
Thank you, James.

Next question Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America.
Ujjwal Pradhan
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start first on ESV and emission reduction targets and some of the items that Diamondback disclosed earlier this week. Diamondback has made significant strides in this area and in many aspects of the industry with the recent emission reduction targets. So I was curious if you could discuss the emission profile for Raptor standalone and whether saw the issue in profile for Raqa stand alone and whether some of the EU initiatives within Fang's broader EU program include some attractive as well.
Travis Stice
You know, it's a good question and we talked about that a lot in the times. That call, you know, I kind of see the commitment that, Donna, that made as consolidated commitments. You know, I think, you know, rattlers carbon footprint is obviously a lot smaller than the Diamondbacks with everything on pipe, but. You know, we are doing things, you know, at the right level to reduce our scope on carbon footprint, which is basically, you know, getting rid of as many generators in field as possible, you know, connecting all of our facilities to two line power. And two-line then on top of that, and I think overall and, you know, this debated if it's a scope or scope to emission. But, you know, we are buying power from renewable sources and sourcing power from renewable sources and that power gets allocated between diamondback rattlers. So I think certainly the foot building rattler was Ezgi positive because you're putting so much stuff, so much production on pipe versus trucks. But on top of that, the next step is, you know, full field electrification across all of our fields and in sourcing that electricity from renewable sources.
Ujjwal Pradhan
Got it and a quick follow up on that, so with this the sourcing renewables, are you able to do that from the grid, you know, given where operations are, where is that, you know, actually investing in some critical assets yourself?
Travis Stice
Now it's from the grid, you know, when we buy both power and this has been a hot topic this week for Texas. But, you know, when you buy both power, you have the option to source it from 100 percent renewable sources, you know, with some assurances, obviously. But, you know, it costs you a little bit more. But it wouldn't be a meaningful amount unless that reduces your total emissions profile.
Ujjwal Pradhan
Got it. Thanks for that. And kids with fangs, production plants largely flat year over year and, you know, significant water disposal capacity at raptor level. Do you think you could approach third parties for opportunities to get higher utilization of those disposal capacity?
Travis Stice
You know, we have discussions with third parties all the time, you know, usually it's in an awkward capacity, you know, so I think, you know, those discussions will continue. I think there's a lot of consolidation to happen in the water business, particularly in the in the Delaware Basin. And that means, you know, bigger relationships with more well-funded counter parties that can take water and vice versa. So I think overall that that's happening. I wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it in our in our financials just because we want to bet on what we can control, which is the Diamondback plan. But certainly, I think, you know, rationalization of capacity in all forms of fashion, in midstream in the Permian is going to happen here.
Ujjwal Pradhan
Got it. Turning to CapEx plans this year, obviously the cappa appear to have come down significantly and could be one of the last years where you have bulk contribution to your JADI projects. Looking forward, are you able to comment on what we should expect the run rate capex specifically will be? And, you know, following up on the umbrella buildout comments earlier, how much of how much capex there could be for that build out?
Travis Stice
Yeah, so, you know, if we built a rather than the bill, that would be, you know, probably less than we originally said, you know, probably close to 30 or 35 million to us. But that's very unlikely to happen. You know, I don't think that's even a 2021 or even 2022 decision. But, you know, I think I can't speak to the operating capex and I think, you know, the team understands that, you know, Rattlers budget starts at zero and builds up from there. You know, we spent 11 or 12 million dollars worth of capital in Q4. You know, our guidance assumes somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 million a quarter. But I think overall, you know, we kind of break out the CapEx into mandatory CapEx and kind of flex capex that, you know, just in case Diamondback still schedule or completion schedule changes. And I'd say, you know, in the budget we presented today, you know, seventy five or two thirds to 75 percent of it is kind of mandatory capex and there's a little bit of flex for the good guys in case things change throughout the year. But overall, that number needs to continue to decline, and particularly in a world where we're not growing at that number needs to continue to decline, and particularly in a world where we're not growing at Diamondback. I think the capital spend will be extremely limited to areas that that are growing rather than areas that are staying flat.
Ujjwal Pradhan
Got it. Very helpful, guys. Thanks for the answers and I'll jump back on the queue.
Operator
Thank you. Next question goes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides
Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. Just curious, a follow up on the potential of maybe chopping down some of the key assets. Can you remind us, sir, have disclosed a lot, just kind of the book value or the asset value of the QIP midstream assets? I'm just trying to get my arms around kind of how big of a potential series of multi-year drop downs could that be or is it relatively small? That's my first question. Second one is, how are you thinking about the cost of capital for rattler right in the best use of cash? Meaning is the best use of cash for rattler to buy assets from diamond, back some of the assets or continue deploying it, whether it's even more deleveraging or even more share buybacks at this unit price.
Travis Stice
Yeah. Michael, good questions. I'll start with the size of the dropdown. I think, you know, in general, overall, we're going to drop everything down at once. You know, I think life's too short for us with three earnings calls in a week to do a multi-stage dropdown. I will say, you know, I'll give you a range of 10 to 20 percent the size of a rattler today. So it's not a huge drop down and certainly manageable with the amount of free cash that we have and the leverage capacity that we have. So like I said, we're not going to cover up the stuff in exchange for the parent. So I think we'll be smart about funding it. But it will be all in one fell swoop.
Then your second question, your use of cash. I think that's you know, that's the question we need to ask ourselves every quarter. And that's the question our board asks of us and talks about in every and every audit committee meeting is you know, is this the best use of our cash to buy back stock at these levels or should we bring back the distribution now? It's a lot easier to it or it was a lot easier in November to say that we're at a four 18 percent free cash flow yield is the best place I could put my money maybe in North America. But, you know, that decision got a little harder this this this quarter because the stocks rallied, but we're still trading at 11 percent free cash flow yield with all of that cash being returned to unit holders and in some form or fashion because there's not a debt issue, rather. So I think it's a fortunate place to be. I think in general, we prefer this to be a higher distribution vehicle than a low float buyback vehicle. But, you know, I think that's a that's a good, good discussion to have.
Michael Lapides
Got it. Thank you, guys, much appreciate it.
Travis Stice
Thank you, Michael.

Next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Truist Securities.
Tristan Richardson
Hey, good morning, guys. I appreciate the comment just on kind of relative scale, the key assets, Chris, just about integration. You know, to the extent that that goes for it, is there organic build out potential or an integration spend potential in terms of linking up QIP midstream assets with rattler assets from a connectivity standpoint?
Travis Stice
Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I think if you look at the map, you know, we're going to have an opportunity to build a very efficient system in Martin County. And, you know, I said did a really good job building up their midstream assets and basically on that county line area, we're neighbors. So that's not a huge amount of capital to connect our systems. But I think overall, as you think about our development, there's not a lot of added capacity needed with the combination of the two. So I think there's going to be some nice efficiencies there. You know, we'll minimize capital spend. And I think overall, you know, I think investors will be surprised with how little capital is needed to integrate those assets because of how Bellport they are that both companies.
Tristan Richardson
Appreciate in case that's all I have, thank you, guys.
Travis Stice
Thank you, Tristan.
