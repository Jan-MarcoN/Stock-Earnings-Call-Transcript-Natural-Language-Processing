I'll now turn the call over to Matthew Kolby. Matthew Kolby, you may begin.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks operator and thanks to everyone for joining us today for Markit's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. I'm joined here by Lance Uggla, Founder and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Gooch, Chief Financial Officer.
As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the IR Section of the Markit website. The press release and supporting documents can also be found on our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this call may include certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
[Audio gap] And looking ahead to 2015 and Jeff will cover the detailed financials before we open up the call for Q&A.
And now I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Okay. Thanks Matt. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.
2014 was an exciting year for Markit. We went public. We exceeded our plans and I am pleased today to report record results for both the fourth quarter and the year.
On Slide 5 you can see records in revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings, supported by a strong performance across all three of our segments. Now Jeff will cover the details, but let me give you the brief highlights.
So revenues for the year up 12.4% with a strong organic growth component of 7.8%. We're also excited that we've broken through $1 billion in revenue for the first time.
The growth delivered through to adjusted EBITDA was up 16% and finally diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 up 7.1%. A great set of numbers keep us on track to achieving our long-term financial objectives of 5% to 7% organic growth, double-digit revenue growth including acquisitions and adjusted EBITDA margins in the low to mid 40s.
So I am very proud of the whole team at Markit who drove these results. It really was a team effort.
Now when we went public, we talked about five factors that were driving our growth. Cost efficiencies demanded in the financial markets, changing regulation, product innovation, customer growth in cross-sell and finally acquisitions. These drivers underpinned our success in 2014 and will be at the heart of our 2015 strategy.
Let me give you some examples of how these drivers worked for us throughout 2014. So first, helping customers address cost inefficiencies. We really have a world-class set of products designed to help our numerous customers address cost inefficiencies.
We're focused on processing and settlement, data management, documentation management as well as delivering software as a service, all of these to help address cost inefficiencies.
We're focused on the creation of repeatable services that benefit Markit participants globally. This year we've seen a good deal of press with respect to the need for an industry service to mange client on-boarding.
Markit has such a service in partnership with Genpact and today I am pleased to update you that we're now working on this with 10 banks globally, including seven of the worlds largest and have on-boarded over 950 buy side for the platform. So we have real momentum that's positioning us very well.
Second, let's talk about the regulatory landscape. It continues to evolve and that's a constant, we expect to see over the next several years. Now what does Markit do with respect to regulatory change? We help our customers comply with specific regulations and in 2014 we had many examples of this. I'll give you a few.
In our Information division, helping customers comply with Basel III. Here we developed a new prudent valuation service that was adopted by many of the largest banks. Over in Processing, MarkitSERV provided confirmation updates on over $1.2 million freights to help roll out the new 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives definition.
And finally in Solutions, we launched functionality to help Asian dealers meet new trading active stations required by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission bringing 15 new dealers on to our counter party manager platform. These are all great examples not complete, but some of where we're helping to implement regulatory change.
Now the next driver is much broader and that is product innovation and innovation really is the heart of everything we do at Markit. It's not just about launching new products. We do that every year, but it's also about continually making incremental product improvements. Let me talk about some of those innovations across our divisions.
I'll start with the Information division. So within our Totem service, we launched a new XVA service to help banks better allocate the profitability of trades. In our Solutions division, we enhanced I think full year offering by adding both SEF and CVS clearing connectivity, becoming the first investment management system to do so.
And finally within our Processing division, MarkitSERV drove connectivity to the Korean Stock Exchange. So we're now connected to five exchanges in Asia, CCPs in Asia and 16 globally, as well as 14 SEFs. These are all small, but incremental and valuable product innovation for our customers that are driving Markit's results.
Customers, cross-selling and adding new customers, this year we had real progress adding 450 new customers globally across different industries, markets and regions, including buy side, sell side and corporates and we made particularly good progress in Asia.
We continue to strengthen existing customer relationships and grew our cross-sell rates globally. This will remain a key strategic initiative for our sales force in 2015 as well as maintaining our contract renewals at or around 90%.
Finally, let's talk about acquisitions. In 2014 we completed two; thinkFolio and CTI. With thinkFolio, we continue to integrate the business into our current product set and have identified many cross-sell opportunities in both our loans and data management businesses.
The CTI integration is also going well and we're seeing strong interest from customers as they see how these tax solutions fit within our broader client on-boarding product set. We think both acquisitions will make continued progress in 2015.
Looking ahead, we have a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and will maintain our focused and disciplined approach on those assets where there is a clear strategic fit and where we believe we can create long-term shareholder value.
When I look forward at 2015, I continue to see the financial industry facing challenges that focuses on growing returns within the new regulatory framework. Across the financial markets, we will see both the buy and sell side further streamlining and standardizing complex processes.
We see this as a significant opportunity and we're well positioned to address these industry changes. We'll continue to invest in our businesses as we see the right opportunities, while retaining our prudent approach to deploying our capital.
We're also well prepared for the move towards electronically executed and cleared derivatives trades that we've discussed before as we continue to actively manage our cost base.
I'll now pass it over to Jeff.
Jeff Gooch
Thanks Lance. Good morning, everyone.
I'll now share summary of our full quarter and full year results. I'll start on Slide 7. As Lance has already said, we're very pleased with operating performance in Q4. Reported revenue increased by 11.3%, and by 12.4% on a constant currency basis.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 15% while margins improved to 46.3%. Adjusted earnings increased 5.7% to $69.1 million, partially impacted by increased amortization and tax charges compared to Q4 2013.
The increased amortization was driven by continued investment over the last few years and a $1.4 million one-time charge related to changes in the estimated life of certain assets.
The reported expected tax rate for Q4 for exceptionally license booked in the period. Our ETL on adjusted earnings was 25.8% in line with our medium term guidance of 26% to 29%. For the full year, we finished slightly below this range of 24.7% due to slightly higher R&D tax credits as anticipated.
Q4 diluted adjusted earnings per share of 37% reflects the higher diluted share count compared to the prior year period. Diluted share count increased 6% offsetting the adjusted earnings growth. Share count increased due to both a higher average share price used to calculate option dilution and option exercising into shares.
We've included in the appendix a summary of the share count movement for this quarter and an overview of our outstanding share options. For the full year, revenue increased 12.4% breaking the $1 billion for the first time and adjusted EBITDA grew by 15.9% whilst margins were maintained.
Full year adjusted earnings were up 12.3% and full year diluted adjusted earnings per share were $1.51 up 7.1%.
Let's now talk about organic growth, which is a key measure for us on Slide 8. Organic revenue growth for the fourth quarter was 8.9% and 7.8% for the full year. This growth was a result of strong performance across all three business segments.
The key focus as Lance mentioned has been our cross-selling imitative, although only nine months into the program, we can now see a measurable improvement in the number of our customers taking more than one product from Markit.
Acquisition related revenue growth for the fourth quarter was 3.5% and 3.1% for the full year. Adverse FX movements during the quarter reduced our revenue growth by 1.1%, whilst for the full year currency exposure had a net positive impact on revenue growth of 1.5%.
Whilst we've seen increased FX floating the market, it's important to remember that our revenue exposures are naturally hedged by sterling expenses to a significant extent. The revenue currency mix of 2014 was 69% U.S. dollars, 26% sterling and 5% other currencies.
Similarly, currency exposure for operating expenses was approximately 51% U.S. dollars, 36% sterling and 13% other currencies. As a rough rule of thumb, a 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies impacts quarterly revenue by approximately $8 million, which is offset by approximately $6 million movement in operating expenses.
Now on to our revenue mix on Slide 9. Here you can see the revenue mix remains broadly stable with 95% recurring revenues of which 54% is revenue from recurring fixed contracts, up from 51% in Q4 2013.
Renewal rates remain robust and approximately 90%. The long-term recurring nature of our revenue is key to our business model, developing high quality predictable earnings.
Slide 10 summarizes our operating expenses. For the full quarter, operating expenses increased by $3.9 million or 2.9% compared to the prior year. Personnel cost increases were partially offset by reduced non-personnel cost.
We've tightly controlled technology spend during the year including shutting credit center in the last quarter as well as reducing other non-personnel cost. Full year operating expenses increased 10.5%, largely due to new higher percent of price on acquisitions. However, we've managed the growth in non-personnel cost of 5.3% for the full year despite our acquisition activity.
Looking forward to the next year, I would like to remind you with respect to increase in personnel cost in Q1 due to annual increase in employee compensation. Now, I'll move on to performance of our three operating segments.
Starting with information on Slide 11, which had a strong finish to the year. Q4 revenue growth was 5.4% while 6.8% on an organic basis. Within Pricing and Reference Data, fixed income products continue to show good revenue growth.
Loan pricing was a particularly strong performer in Q4, which reflected increased demand from CLOs, new entrants to the loan market and new product enhancements including additional loan performance in [data] [ph].
Industry showed good growth across our economic, bond and derivative indices. A number of products within valuation and trading services delivered solid revenue growth for Q4. For example portfolio valuations grew due to both enhanced product coverage and volume increases and our new transaction cost balances offering continue to secure new customers.
The overall growth for the sub-segment was limited due to the impact of the closure of our bulk Trade Reporting service.
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $64.3 million during the current quarter. Full year revenue growth in the segment was 5.9% with organic revenue growth of 4.4%. However, the combination of the Totem term-out on the sale of our Trade Reporting business reduced organic information growth by 1.2% compared to the full year in 2013. Going forward, the Trade term-out had a smaller impact in 2015.
Full year adjusted EBITDA of $239.2 million grew by 10.1% with full year margins improving to 49.2% due to the strong operating leverage in the business.
Turning now to Processing on Slide 12, revenue during the fourth quarter increased 5.4% or 6.2% on an organic basis. This was driven by growth in OTC derivative processing with high volatility driving volumes and interest rate businesses. We also have benefitted from increased revenue credit due to compression activity and one-off support from the transition in CVS documentation standards.
Our loans processing business saw an overall decline in revenue in Q4 with increased revenue from secondary trading being offset by reduction in volumes compared to the same quarter in '13.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased to $36.5 million resulting in improved operating margins of 53.3%. In Q4 we did not see a significant impact on revenue from electronic execution and clearing derivatives. Now we've started to deliver cost savings in anticipation of future impacts.
Overall, full year revenue growth of 7.4% with organic revenue growth of 5.1%, whilst full year EBITDA increased to $156.6 million.
We've not yet seen an impact from SEC trading so far in Q1, but we will be making certain pricing adjustments, mostly focused on SEF flows at the beginning of Q2 2015.
We will start charging SEF flows at a lower price point even where customers have not yet made the technology transition to the simpler work flow. These changes and customer retention by supporting our technology transition and enable us to solve our revenue uncertainty.
Whilst the exact impact will vary with volume of SEF adoption, we estimate that these changes will result in a $3 million to $5 million reduction in quarterly revenue from the start of Q2.
As a reminder through the last quarter's call, we shared our conservative estimate that the potential revenue impact from electronic trading will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million per year in total phased in over the next three years. This overall estimate has not changed and as price changes crystallize the initial phase of this impact.
Turing now to our Solutions segment on Slide 13, fourth quarter reported revenues increased by 28.8% or 15.7% on organic basis. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was driven by new business wins across both Managed Services and Enterprise Software. We saw double-digit growth in EDM, WSO services, Analytics and counterparty manager.
In Q4, we started to recognize revenue associated with Markit services to our Gen KYC joint venture as well as, previously mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum for the service.
In November, we announced the sale of our Collaboration Services business to Symphony, which had no material impact to our Q4 results and had no material impact in 2015. The acquisitions of thinkFolio and CTI in 2014 and Corp Actions in 2013 contributed 13.9% to fourth quarter revenue growth.
Markit Corporate Actions in particular showed strong performance for the quarter.
Full year constant currency growth was 30.9% including organic growth of 17.8%. Overall adjusted EBITDA margin reflects our continued investment in new initiatives and acquisitions and solutions, but margins across the rest of the businesses in the segment remain robust and have shown significant improvement year-over-year.
Markit shares results from our KYC joint venture with Genpact were consolidated in Q4 for the first time. The fourth quarter EBITDA impacted this consolidation was a loss of $1.2 million reflecting the equalization service cost with Genpact.
Iâd like to point out in appendix was included a revenue breakdown of the sub-segment levels to both intimation solutions. We're committed to providing these on an annual basis.
Now looking an exceptional items in Slide 14, in the fourth quarter, we recognized the impairments of $31.5 million primarily related to Markit analytics in our Solutions segment. Whilst the business showed good revenue growth for 2014, we conducted a strategic review of the business during the quarter and plan to make significant investments in developing the product to target additional customer groups.
Given these increased costs, and with a prudent view to future revenue performance, it has a carrying value of this asset.
Looking now Slide 15, operating cash flows for the year were $369.9 million an 8.9% increase compared to last year, which has enabled us to reduce net debt by 36.3% with the acquisitions of thinkFolio and CTI.
We showed good control of capital expenditure whose totals were $124.9 million for the year down $5.6 million or 4.3% from the prior year. This reflected reduced third party technology spend in 2014 and reduced investments in office space.
We ended the year with a leverage ratio of 0.65 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Iâd like to mention you one of our previously stated capital allocation strategies. Firstly we invest in our businesses for organic growth and you can see this in our Solutions segment this quarter.
Secondly we look to acquire complementary businesses in a disciplined manner. Weâre currently actively looking at number of bolt-on acquisitions where we believe we can held shareholder value.
Strategically, we're comfortable with our bolt-on acquisition model and any larger deal in feature would only be considered with a strong conviction on investment returns.
Thirdly, we consider share buybacks. Historically, we've bought back stock and continue to believe this can both mitigate dilution from employee stock compensation and enhance long-term shareholder value.
Currently, management is actively looking at the appropriate mechanism and timing for share buybacks during the course of 2015 and will make any appropriate announcements later in the year.
Iâll now hand back to Matt.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks Jeff. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now take the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Okay, we have Manav Patnaik from Barclays on line with a question. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik
Hi, good morning gentlemen. Just wanted to clarify on the processing side, so the $50 million to $60 million a year hit gross, is that the $3 million to $4 million that you talked about quarterly starting in Q2, like was that baked into that $50 million to $60 million or was it incremental to that, I guess I was just trying to clarify that.
Jeff Gooch
It's a good point to clarify, that absolutely baked in. Itâs part of that $50 million to $60 million. So itâs the first part. On the last quarterly call, I said we anticipate an impact on the first half of this year and then should be the first stage of it.
Manav Patnaik
Okay, all right. And then so that quarterly reduction, which you attributed to price, that would be presumably and dropped all the way through to the bottom line, so any help on how we should think about margins?
Jeff Gooch
I think the initial flow through for Q2 will largely be to the bottom line. We already saw and our numbers started to address the cost base in this quarter is one of the reasons why margins expanded. We'll probably continue on that basis through Q1, but Q2 you'll certainly see margins come back down again.
As you know, longer term against the three year estimate is still lot more we can do on expenses and seems very actively working on lot of customer occasions to start technology consultation and other things that we can do.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. And then generally I understand youâre not giving 2015 guidance, but is there anything, obviously you call that process but let just say an information and solutions that should change the trajectory of your topline growth and your, I guess margin expansion and information and then I guess margin investment and solution.
Jeff Gooch
No, I think we've tried to highlight through the call, all of the things on a topline perspective that would impact, one is that change in Q2 for processing. Secondly, the year-over-year impact of Totem term-out to be less pronounce next year than it has been this year, but I think otherwise we're sticking with that 5% to 7% may be in term target for topline growth.
On bottom line since that will be the next question, yeah the one thing that you noted looking at numbers historically, personnel cost will pick up in the first quarter as we give annual increases and that's got to baked into margins through the course of the year as revenues pick up to catch up.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. And then just one last one for Lance, just in term of this active pipeline that you guys referred to, I understand that there is obviously timing and when things close and so forth, but can you just help us understand the nature of those discussions? Is it -- how valuations getting out of hand, is that why itâs taking long? Or just some color on whatâs happening behind the scenes?
Lance Uggla
Okay, well if you look at 2014, we only completed two acquisitions and one of them we're negotiating in late 2013. So definitely throughout 2014, we had a lot of discipline. We were steadily looking at our landscape and looking at opportunities.
We donât feel that we missed anything, but we definitely have a very close eye on shareholder value in terms of return on invested capital and discipline around the debt and expectations of integration.
So â14 really was quite quiet. As we went into the end of '14 now into the first quarter of '15, what I can say is, is there is a robust pipeline of things we're looking for.
So Iâd say a bit more activity than we saw at any point through 2014 in terms of the numbers of things we're looking at and we're advancing a few of those through the pipeline. So I do think that our -- again our long-term objectives of the organic growth plus a double-digit growth with acquisitions is intact and we're busy on that front.
Nothing to announce at this time, but the pipeline is robust and that activity is expected to flow through in throughout 2015. I do think itâs important to note that one of the things that I feel our team and Markit has stood for in terms of our approach on acquisitions is that we look for very integratable bolt-on acquisitions and they need to produce the right return on capital for us to actually make those acquisitions happen.
And just last year, that pipeline was not very robust in terms of the number of things that we saw that met that pattern, but that has increased in the end of the year into the beginning of this year.
Manav Patnaik
All right. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman form JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Louis Pavia
Hi, this is Louise Pavi on the line for Andrew Steinerman. Can you guys give us an update on the timing of platform migration and processing and what impact that could have margin? Are there any periods in time where we should look for step change in margin there?
Jeff Gooch
Hello, it's Jeff. I think the margins were up from the way. From our perspective, we've been focusing short term on staffing changes, but the location in numbers, which you see in the results. There is more to do that.
In terms of dealing with the bigger platform ways that you know and multiyear initiative, I think it's still very much in the sort of planning stage and we've got new deadlines to get on when that will be done, but that's something it will take several years rather in the next couple of quarters to realize. But certainly that's big opportunities on the cross side over that three year time period.
Louis Pavia
Okay. Thank you. And then you also said on processing there was a one-off benefit from CDS documentation changes? Did that have a material impact on the organic growth rate for the quarter?
Jeff Gooch
From the maximum we had, the impact to the organic growth rate for the quarter, I think in the full year context, I think it makes a lot of difference. Just to be clear to everybody the credit industry you saw the change to the documentation standard that used to reflect some of the events over the last couple of years.
That reconfirmed there was an agreement we we're having with the existing trade documents in a different way, but as a great example, the loss will come in about how Markit can get involved in those regulatory driven situations and they have to do something, which years ago would have taken months in the tens of millions of dollars of man hours with all the banks try and make it happen to make it possible and that we can get involved there over a couple of weekends move $1.2 million documents down to a new standards, which is fantastic result.
Louis Pavia
Okay great. And you're saying on a full year basis it's not really going to move the needle on organic growth for that segment?
Jeff Gooch
Thatâs correct. Yes
Louis Pavia
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Sara Gubins from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Chu
Hi this is David Chu for Sara Gubins. So Iâm not quite sure the $3 million to $5 million you talked about quarterly impact versus the $30 million to $50 million kind of annual declines in revenue, what's the disconnect there?
Jeff Gooch
The big number comes from a review over the next three years regulated globally in the U.S., Europe, Far East with core electronic trading for the Vanilla derivatives and that we did a lot of transactions, which will move to electronic trading over a three-year period.
At the moment, the only place where it happens in the U.S. to FTC regulation products. We said on previous calls that Markit shrunk somewhat trades and activity move out of the U.S., but there is a piece that's there, which trades electronically. Most of our customers have not made the technology changes as of today to use a lot of price flow that has been available to them.
What we are going to do some Q2 is for those existing trades and already traded on SEF is allow them to achieve that lower price point without making the technology transition, but we're going to make it at some point any way.
But from our perspective it gives a bit more predictability to our results and from a customer perspective they can make the change for '15 with technology cycle following the trend of special releases to get a price change from outside and it helps their cost base as well.
David Chu
Sorry. I still didn't get it. So the $30 million to $50 million is the impact of moving rates and credit to SEF right. So what is the $3 million to $5 million that you are speaking to?
Jeff Gooch
So the 30-50 is global number when the whole world moved to electronic trading, which will be a three-year process. The $3 million to $5 million is relatively small number of trades, which are already executed on SEF as of today being moved to eventually lower price point as a quarterly number.
David Chu
And is included in that $30 million to $50 million. So are you saying that $30 million to $50 million annually or in the three-year window.
Jeff Gooch
So last quarter, we said that over three years there will be a $50 million to $60 million change in revenue as the whole world moved from voice to electronic trading. So that's the guidance we've given for the headwind processing over three years.
The $3 million to $5 million that we're predicting will happen in Q2 is the starting to bite into that $50 million to $60 million because one of part of the world is moving to electronic trading, that's the CFTC regulated activity post DoddâFrank and what we are saying to our customers is even if you havenât changed the work flow, but you're trading on FEVs electronically, we're going to start to give you that price reduction.
We think one is good for customer franchise and two, it starts to give certainty towards that $50 million to $60 million that will happen over the next three years. Now on the other side that of courseâ¦
David Chu
Sorry, so its $50 million to $60 million over three years and its originally the $3 million to $5 million is kind of incremental start to it that we're going to expect to start to see in the second quarter?
Lance Uggla
Correct.
David Chu
Okay. Got it. And so in terms of KYC, do you still think you can be EPS accretive in 2016 for the product?
Lance Uggla
I believe what we said at the last year that we will have revenues in 2015. And I don't think we have given any more guidance on that at this present time.
Jeff Gooch
I think we've been pretty clear, we don't expect to be earnings positive in '15.
David Chu
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Ato Garrett
My first question has to do with some more of the media coverage that we've seen with large banks and the perspective sales some of their index businesses. I am sure you guys are tracking those potential transactions and just wanted to get your perspective whether you think those are taking -- whether those might take a while to close or if those are going to able to maybe possibly quicker transactions.
And also I also had a follow-up just to see if you had any updates on the European Commission Investigation?
Lance Uggla
Iâll take the first one and Iâll give Jeff the second one. So on the index side, we're engaged in discussions with several financial institutions with respect to the sale of their index operation and we think that those will be ongoing throughout 2015 and as we've said before we like that space.
We think it's a good growth driver for our Information division long term and we're very much focused on the index assets and we feel they fit our bolt on strategy for incremental organic growth very well. Jeff, do you want to take second one?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, I think there is no particular update in terms of those anti-trust cases movements in the last quarter. So we will stick with the same prudency on that.
Ato Garrett
Great. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm
Well, they donât call me Alex today that's good. Anyways good morning, everyone. Well Neil is my first name actually technically, but I wanted to come back to the processing side.
I think I understand what you're doing here obviously taking the bleeding a little earlier here and given more a view of what's going to maybe shake out anyways over a long period of time probably helps the customer franchise.
So the question is, obviously with the U.S. now being done basically as we go into other jurisdictions let's say Europe starts going 2016, would you do the same thing basically? Would you take the head early and say like listen, we donât care how long this is going to play out, we just going to take the head early as we move to these other jurisdictions, what I'm trying to say?
Jeff Gooch
I understand the question. We've made no decisions about long term processing strategy, particularly [indiscernible] in the US, we've started to make particularly as low here in U.S. Weâre looking everything else on a case by case as the business rolls out.
Alex Kramm
Okay. All right, fair enough. And then may be just on processing on the loan side appreciated the extra color but can you may be give us a little bit more on how much that loan business actually constituent in processing. And then particularly how much primary and secondary issuance or trading is since, I think there is a view out there, the secondary will continue to do well given the size of the market that has grown last year.
But I think issuance is looking little bit soft may be like 20% down in 2015 as you talked to that. So in that scenario, how would you view the loan side of that business?
Jeff Gooch
We said previously, the lines is the second biggest product in processing. Our interest rate droves to being a biggest than loans in credit, with the big drop offs to the FX and equity is much smaller businesses.
Our business as we said in loans, is the mixture of secondary and primary. I think I could agree with your comments, secondary market has been very strong at the last year continues to be strong.
Loan market on the primary side, we had a weaker fourth quarter and this continue to be relatively strong, at the first two weeks of this year.
So we see in terms of - how that comes out. Itâs probably too early to call at the moment but I think clearly primary issuance side has been a bit slower in the last couple of months.
Alex Kramm
Okay. But no color on how, what the mix primary versus the secondary, you donât want to go there?
Jeff Gooch
We're not going to go there.
Alex Kramm
Okay. And then may be just lastly as somebody asked on KYC already, can you - and you made the comment about 10 banks being on the platform now, can you see what youâre seeing now on the competitive side.
I mean Clarent for example, I think there are some founding banks I think seven or so. Are those banks in your platform to how do you feel against, other options out there?
Lance Uggla
Well, there are three choices out in the marketplace right now that people consider the Markit ZenPack offering, the Clarent offering, and in some jurisdictions TR. So those are the three offerings.
I think we made good headway this year. We have 10 banks now engaged from the original four that we started with. So I think that's a good, a very, very good progress because of course, those institutions have choices as well. So weâre pleased that they chose to go with us.
And we've used our market counterparty manager platform to onboard, I think in Q3 or around Q2 or Q3 last year we announced we had 700 approximate buy side on-boarded and by the end of the year we had 950.
And I think those are the types of the things that you should look at to see progress. I think the industry knows that client on-boarding is a key expense initiative that needs to developing to a managed service.
We'd hope there to be one, maybe there will be two, but we feel our progress has been very, very strong, and we feel that, the number of institutions participating and the number of buy side engaged are two important measures to the competitive success of the platform. And I don't have those numbers for either of the competitors, so I canât answer those questions.
Alex Kramm
All right. Fair enough. Thank you.

And our next question comes from Gerald Bisbee from RBC. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Gerald. I just had a quick question going back to the Information segment, obviously had strong revenue growth and profit margins in the quarter. I guess could you guys give us little bit more color in terms of what drove that strength and how sustainable it is throughout 2015.
Jeff Gooch
Yeah, I think I'd commented - some of the colleagues I made earlier on, but particularly fixed income pricing has been very strong for us in the second half of the year. I think I highlighted, the Q4 loan pricing in particularly was strong within a lot new entrants, pension funds coming into the loan market.
So, I think our pricing that I referenced out and business had good momentum and continues to do so. So that's been a great driver. Index business was a good solid growing business, particularly for bond indices and economic indices on the derivative side picking up.
And then valuation trading services is a quite few different businesses in that grouping, someone like PB have been performing very we'll. Other like that which we closed down and possibly we had to turn out to drag back a numbers a little bit.
So I would sort of characterize that fourth quarter and probably most of 2014 growth to be pricing and reference side as driven.
Unidentified Analyst
And I guess the sustainability within those divisions to, how is that change so far in â15.
Jeff Gooch
I think, do know where the growth is coming from - some of the comments Lance made earlier, we do a little work on cross setting which we think it is a great opportunity to find new customers. We acquiring new customers into the firm, and constantly notifying those products to make new to new customers group.
So I think continues to do for the share â I'll make a full looking statement about it, but I think in practice as a good business models, it works well for number of years.
Unidentified Analyst
Great. The recurring fixed revenue that obviously increased become more or greater portion of sales, obviously a lot of it has to do with the success you guys had and information but I guess geographically has some of the success kind of been fairly equal cross your main geographic regions or is there anyone particular place that that's doing better than ours?
Jeff Gooch
I think it has been fairly strong across the Board, I should particularly focus on loss âactual strategy on where we are.
Lance Uggla
Okay. So we increased our footprint in Asia, quite substantially my partner and co-founder Kevin Gould moved out there about a year and few months now -- a year and half ago. And we have just shy of 200 people on the ground from Sydney to Tokyo.
We definitely have steepened our trends and are seeing increased performance across all three divisions and I really think itâs a combination of having strong decision making on the ground and then being properly staffed with appropriate sales and marketing folks that have the, depth knowledge in our products in each of the regions.
So we've had great success Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore. So I'm pleased with those results. And then Europe and North America regulation drives for cost efficiencies as being able to innovate and enhance our products to meet new regulations, is feeling steady growth across the firm.
And Iâm very pleased - I think this year was slightly above our trend 5% to 7% organic growth but I really think, relative to our peers, I think that weâre right in the sweet spot. So I think we have done, done a great job.
Unidentified Analyst
Great, thanks.
Operator
And your next question comes from George Mihalos from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
George Mihalos
Great. Thanks for taking my questions and nice to see the accelerating organic growth. Wanted to dig in on the solution side of the business, obviously that somewhat lumpy growth was stronger in the first half of the year then it was in the back half.
Any thoughts about what sort of the proper growth rate is jumping off going in â15, I think you had said 15% to 20% is sort of the long term rate of growth but any sort of narrowing you could provide for us.
Lance Uggla
Well, solutions is an area that, I think we clearly stated perjuring and post IPO is in area that we see as carrying above trend growth for us, a long term over the next three to five years.
Within that division we have a lot of investment going on. And we have a lot of product that are delivering double digit growth. So we continue to be very bullish on those investments. And we think that to expect mid, high teens up to 20% organic growth in that division is a reasonable expectation.
George Mihalos
Okay, so looking at the performance in 2014 that's a pretty good read going into 2015?
Lance Uggla
Yeah, I think that's a fair statement.
George Mihalos
Okay. And then can you just remind us I know you [indiscernible] fully your acquisition now, CTI is still outstanding I think for another two quarters. What exactly is the contribution of growth from CTI, 13.9% acquisition related growth and solution how much of that is coming from CTI. Thank you.
Lance Uggla
Well, we don't disclose the individual assets out in that format. But what I can tell you is CTI this year was about integration moving over staff over to our premises integrating into other software assets.
And account management process, weâve added the first ever sales people to that product, that products always been sold by the product managers of the technologies. So weâve added - Andrew Well has added a sales team that's now on the ground on a global basis.
We've integrated account management and professional services as well as introduced onsite training programs. So, weâre doing a lot to make it look feel like the rest of our software division. And the rest of the software division has growth in line with the expectations we have for that division and we expect thinkFolio to fit into that equally.
So we're pleased - Iâm pleased with this year's performance in terms of the integration and fit and we don't expect - we expect it to perform right in the sweet spot of that division.
Jeff Gooch
I just like to clarify, the original outside CTI both CTI and thinkFolio been a quite a organic growth and neither of those are being trend to our current organic growth numbers?
George Mihalos
Okay, great. Thank you.
Lance Uggla
I would say one thing that I quite - I kind of sort of mentioned in my opening with respect to thinkFolio on incremental enhancements. One of the key things when we talk about cross-sell thinkFolio is getting - because it's our first kind of on the desk portfolio tool, we've looked for key integration to our strong presence in the loan market.
And we have several new customers and data working with us on portfolio management solutions around the loan space. And the cross-sell into our loan clients is several hundred accounts and that's a key initiative for us in 2015. And it just showed how the cross-sell works really well.
So that would be the WSO software assets marrying together with our thinkFolio assets. We have probably time for couple of more questions yeah nine minutes.
Operator
We have Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley online with the question. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan
Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just to make sure I completely understand the processing revenue figure out very correctly. You mentioned the pricing change starting in 2Q, so I guess that means that in 1Q youâre not really expecting any sort of impact.
And then after the second quarter should we expect that the $3 million to $5 million accelerates at some point with - and what would cause the acceleration would it be a shifting of customers work flows leading to sort of a step change. Is that the right way to think about it?
Jeff Gooch
You're absolutely correct, there will be no impact from a change in Q1 and weâll kick it on 1st of April at beginning of Q2.
Secondly, the estimate weâve given is based on the volume of SaaS trades we see today. We'll see that number reflects up and down by overall volumes in the market whether SaaS compared must more market share from both trading and whether we have in market share connectivity provided.
So, you have caveat it, over the next few years we expect a lot more SaaS trades against the 50 million to 60 million number over three years but the 3 million to 5 million maximum weâre currently seeing today just the impacts of that pricing change.
Toni Kaplan
Okay, great. And then could you provide just a little bit more insight on the exceptional charge for a market analytics, I think you mentioned that had sort of weaker than anticipated growth, can you just give us maybe some background on when the product was built or acquired and the background behind it?
Jeff Gooch
We brought that business in 2010. If you look at originally now the business very much focused on large installation and market reassessments for bank. If you look through 2014, weâve seen a good revenue growth through 2014, but as we mentioned earlier down our strategy review position our business for next few years.
And we really want to do two things. One is to modify that for us other customer groups, that only has been success, which Lance mentioned. That does increase the cost life of the product quite considerably.
Secondly given recent performance, we want to take somewhat more conservative view of the revenue outlook. I know some tax changes given that more conservative views, a bunch of tax credits we've incurred from that business, which we donât think is too proven to recognize given performance as part of the numbers.
So, combination of that led us from accounting perspective to make a write-down on good will carrying all the customers, assets doing that would shape.
The key point is, this change result our decision to invest more in that business because we talked about our prospects. So from a accounting perspective, generates a write-down, but it's no indicative of anything it does has a commitment that zero percent.
Toni Kaplan
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
And your next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin
Thank you, good morning. Most of my questions have actually been answered. Just one simple question in terms of the products and solution I know they grew double-digits and speaking with the 15% to 20% range for 2015. I was wondering if you could provide kind of an update versus say the time weâre at on - how much three of the major products the EDM solutions, market On Demand and WSO are contributing to revenue today versus some of your newer solutions.
And then if you look back on 2015, how they'll probably rank in terms of being contributors to that 15% to 20% growth?
Jeff Gooch
I think if you look at those businesses, I mean EDM is been clearly as a percentage and so build in term are fastest growing business.
That percentage is going to come down next year, because weâre comparing to a small or bigger base given to the high growth, but I mean as Lance said, weâre also telling the good many times particularly lot of new customers onto that business.
We never found installation, we never lost a customer, there's a great success story. So weâre starting to integrate that with thinkFolio and with some other parts of the base.
On the WSO side again, a very strong growth through 2014 particularly on the 70s side. The reason our cloud services rather software - we bring clients in, much clients these days want to take the managed services. We would cannibalize our existing software business by upgrading customers from pure software to services, but that has software like growth left quickly but services been a strong growth for us.
An idea has been high-single digits showing for the full year. I think in the nine months part we just drift into double-digit. This is a very large business for us and so again dollar terms a big contributor but hovering that about by 10% mark, a great performance.
And then there is bunch of smaller products that growth very quickly and counterparty manager being an obvious one doing strong double-digit growth and somewhat smaller base. Iâve covered all the ones you mentioned.
Andre Benjamin
Thanks for that.
Jeff Gooch
That segment software and services is going to be a good growth engine for us into next year. I think 15% organic growth for Q4 about 17% for the full year, it gets hard to get 20 for bigger base, but if you think the next year but still I think thereâs lot of growth opportunities there.
Andre Benjamin
If we want to make some kind of assumption at those three kind of add up to 80%, 90% of the segment is that an older statement?
Jeff Gooch
I havenât got the numbers beside yet, looking over statements for me, but we havenât disclosed individual product numbers.
Operator
And our last question comes from Vincent Hung of Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Vincent Hung
Hi, just firstly, if I look at the information segment the revenues have been about 122 to 123. So last three quarters so this big step up in margin this quarter. Maybe I missed it, but just can you give me a bit color there because I have seen slide - operating leverage so Iâm just trying to look at whatâs going on?
Jeff Gooch
Yeah I think itâs always the case with the information segment. The flow through really depends where the growth comes from. Last couple of quarters we get good growth on established products like fixed income pricing, weâre getting new operating leverage is a very strong business.
If you have to add new products in the cost of the getting there, so it always depends where the growth is being coming. But second half of this year it has been growth from established products, is really been driving fulfillments, hence the high flow through in the margin. Also fair to say the guys have done a good job on expenses in terms of margins.
Vincent Hung
Okay. And on Slide 18, you provided the update of the sub-segment revenue. Can you just give me a sense for the year-over-year growth between derivatives and loan processing please?
Jeff Gooch
So I think for the Q4 number, we had a very positive OTC derivatives growth, I think if I remember right, organic growth overall for the quarter was about 5.5% just check the report, but yeah loans with negative. So that was really a positive result on secondary and negative result on primary as compared to 2013.
If you look at the trend through this year I think weâll see a similar pattern to Q3. Q4 was a little bit difficult to make the assessment because of Thanksgiving and Christmas, as fewer trading days. So that would impact the secondary volumes. We have to go and fix that out in terms of the numbers.
But I think weâre seeing from OTC growth across that mix of products good secondary growth, negative growth.
Vincent Hung
Okay. And just lastly on the cost savings and processing, firstly where those cost savings come from and how far are we down the line of and the overall cost savings that talk about within the next three years?
Jeff Gooch
So I think yeah the moment what the guys, Brad seem to have been very focused on is couple of things. One is looking at our people cost. Both in terms of where those people are located and the number of people we have. Secondly, trying to be very focused on our own investment profile. So decision to shut credit center as we talked about last quarter for example it was very beneficial in terms with technology cost of that segment.
So those were the kind of things that are easy to act or we're developing to act on those in preparation for that revenue reduction, other things weâll work on longer term will be I think, you had -- guys mentioned earlier platform consolidation is something that gives us a big opportunity.
And also as we've said previously, a significant part of our cost base at the moment is modifying the system for the new regulatory requirements at some point and obviously that will be down and that will make us to write for that development investment as well.
Vincent Hung
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Iâll now turn the call back over to Lance Uggla for final comments.
Lance Uggla
Okay. Thank you.
Well thank you everybody for the call today and the questions. Just following up on Andreâs question of GS, I did a quick back of the envelope and I think the top three products Andre would be closer to 55% to 60% sub-60% if you did that calculation. So nowhere near the 80% number that you had possibly suggested.
So I just want to say that I think the opportunity set that surrounds us in 2015, looks pretty similar to me to the one when we started 2014. I think the need for assistance to rule out regulatory change thatâs at a higher the high as ever and in fact the regulatory change isnât just known, itâs been implemented and thatâs good for Markit.
The second thing thatâs good for Markit, which I see increasingly pushing us towards the larger percentage of activities with the buy side as well as the sell side is the need to reduce cost.
Regulatory change and profitability in our industry is not just a sell-side problem. Large buy side are also facing substandard cost that they need to manage and they want to manage them with services that are hosted, managed, outsourced and Markit is very well positioned and I believe our teams are very well positioned globally to execute on those changes.
We had a quiet acquisition footprint in '14. As I mentioned our pipelines are stronger donât know if that will mean that we make one, two, three or no acquisitions, but I can guarantee you that our discipline is high and the opportunity set that weâre looking at will only be executed on if it fits from a shareholder perspective. And weâll be increasingly diligent as we have been.
So thank you very much and I look forward to talking to you again next quarter and until then thank you very much, bye.
