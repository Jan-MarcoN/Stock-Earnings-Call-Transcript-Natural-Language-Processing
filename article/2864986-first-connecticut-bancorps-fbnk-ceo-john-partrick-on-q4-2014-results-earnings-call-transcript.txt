Good morning and welcome to the First Connecticut Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Daukas. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Daukas
Good morning everyone. Thank you, Theresa. I am the Investor Relations Officer of the company and before we begin with our presentation today, weâd like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcement. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor afforded by that advisement. Thank you and now here is John Partrick, our Chairman, President and CEO. 
John Patrick
Thanks Jennifer. Good morning everyone and thank you for your interest in First Connecticut Bancorp and turning into our call. I was going to actually change the format up today and have all my management team do a presentation, but then when I turned Bloomberg on, I saw a quote from Ben Franklin that said âSpeak little, do much.â And so I think thatâs what weâre going to stick to our typical brief overview and let you guys ask the questions because I know how busy this earnings season is for everyone out there.
We are very pleased with where we are at the end of the year, at the end of the fourth quarter. We delivered on all our core objectives and keeping in mind that our business model remains as simplistic as we can keep it, taking in deposits and making good loans. And I think that you saw our retail deposit growth in the quarter, which we felt was very good and Iâll talk a little bit about that.
And then obviously our loans continue to grow in the quarter and asset quality continues to improve. So not only are we growing loans, but weâre also improving the quality of the assets and the balance sheet and in doing so increasing the diversification of the composition of those loans on the balance sheet.
We have a company that we are very focused on process improvement and expense control, and our expenses overall from where we were a year-ago, Iâm very pleased with. We do have the added expense in the fourth quarter of our strategic investment in Western Massachusetts and that expense in the fourth quarter really is a full impact of the hires that we had. And in fact, besides the team of lenders that we had, weâre able to attract a very confident and experienced cash management professional in that market also. So that was one additional body that we added that I didnât expect when we did the initial list out of the team. 
In addition, as we continue to grow the company, I think itâs important for us and we started the growth of our company based of a solid risk management platform and we also added to our risk management area during the quarter to encompass some of the added growth that we had this past year and would anticipate as we continue to move our company forward next year.
So those expenses are all in and even though they were all-in in the fourth quarter, I do feel good about where that is and then driving that efficiency ratio down into the 70âs, which I think that we gave some forward guidance as thatâs all we needed to be at the end of the year and we will continue to focus on that going forward.
So, weâre right on target where we work. As it relates to the deposit side, we do have high loans in deposit ratio where we are cognizant of that. We are growing our net new accounts in a very favorable basis and I have done a good job of that again this year and during the quarter.
One of the reasons our deposit cost is up for the quarter is that there was a significant amount of disruption in the marketplace that we want to take advantage of with other companies and so we had some targeted pricing and targeted nailing around the disruptions, some banks were closing branches, other ones were doing conversions and a variety of other things, and we thought it was an opportunity time for us to take advantage of that. And then also when youâre balancing through this low interest rate environment and margin compression and youâre looking at deposits, you want to make sure, I always want to make sure that you have theories in place of what you will do, but I always like to test those theories out and so based upon where we were from a run rate perspective on the loan side as well as the flexibility, I thought, we had because of our process improvement during the quarter and during the year.
We kind of tested a little bit of the deposit market outside of our market area with some laddered and structured CDs which I think fit in well with our asset liability management going forth and so that cost us a little bit. The good news was, is that as weâve tested those markets which were contiguous markets to where we operate, but we have no presence whatsoever we turn those promotions off in a week and a half because of the ability to attract deposits very, very quickly.
So even though our loan-to-deposit ratio is high, I feel very confident in where we are, I also feel very confident and happy with the level of and the growth that we are seeing in our municipal banking area, we continued to get approved by new towns and cities both within and outside of our marketplace as their primary bank and many RPs that we are responding to, that are out there, that are coming up for renewal weâre taking advantage of it and becoming the primary bank of choice for those towns and cities.
So we are not fitting on the municipal money for say, from a half money perspective though what we are doing is adding to the core that we have today with the talented team that we have in place and again this is something that weâve been building since weâve started our strategic initiatives over five years and itâs turning into a very, very good, consistent and predictable funding source for us.
So as I said before, we continue to hit on the numbers, weâre pleased where we are in the Western Massachusetts, we are already closing loans in that marketplace, shortly, weâll announce the locations of the two branch offices that we have identified in that market, weâre finalizing, there was negotiations in our due diligence now. We took a little bit extra time because we wanted to make sure we had the right locations which we believe that we do, but that has not stopped us from our deposit gathering opportunities on the commercial side in that market especially with technology and remote deposit capture, weâve already started to see deposits and lone growth in those markets and itâs just a beginning of that, so Iâm still encouraged by that.
So overall for us, we feel very good about the year, we feel very good about our strategy. The biggest challenge in â Iâm sure youâve heard it from every bank CEO that youâve talked to is the margin compression relative to where rates are today, I canât do anything about that, all I can do is make my company â continue to make my company more efficient, even though that weâre going to have that margin compression going forward and thatâs now becoming embedded in the culture of our organization, so I donât think that we need to change at all. Our thoughts relative to our expense base, we ended our decline in expenses going forward.
So with that Greg, Iâm not sure if you have a couple of things to touch on in the margin and so forth.
Gregory White
Yeah, thank you, John. Our margin was $281 last quarter down from $289 in prior quarter, shortly noticed in the press release weâve talked about a $250,000 non-recurring payment on a loan participation, so adjusting for that, our margin was $276 obviously a sizable drop towards both sides of the balance sheet as John talked about cost of funds already.
On the asset side, point-to-point we grew a lump sum of $90 million during the quarter, itâs a $105 million on an average balance bases and the majority of that is what we feel is very high quality commercial real estate and most of that real estate was swapped out and really held the variable piece on our balance sheet during the quarter and not sure the quote is obviously itâs the big drop in margin but if we include a loan that we closed on the last day of the third quarter, we closed and swap it was a large loan plus over $45 million that weâve swapped during the fourth quarter and we kept the fixed rate option instead of putting the floating rate option on the balance sheet that would have been a positive 5 basis point impact of margin and actually even more on loan yield.
So the net effect is obviously swapping those loanâs cost was 5 basis points, and margin needless to say we always have been, weâre still very concerned with the mark-to-market of our balance sheet in rising interest rates. There is a cost for that lost fee both in margin and earnings but weâre confident thatâs the right thing to do still at this point.
John mentioned, we tested the deposit side of the balance sheet. Our cost of funds was up seven basis points. We donât give guidance, but you are certainly not going to see that again. We ran some long-term CD specials at the beginning of the quarter. We did pull them when rates dropped. We had some money market specials during the quarter as well. And then we also continue to extend our overnight borrowings out into the three to five year area as well, so all of those contributed to the higher cost of funds.
And then on the retail side, we did bring in $92 million of non-municipal deposits during the quarter too. So again big drop in margin, but a lot of that was strategic on our end, and thatâs it margin, John.
John Patrick
Great, I think that what weâll do now Jennifer is probably open it up for questions and go from there.
Jennifer Daukas
Okay, Theresa
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Travis Lan of KBW. Please go ahead.
Travis Lan
Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Greg, just back on the funding costs, were any of those promotions short-term in running off or is this, this higher. I know you said that that kind of the growth wouldnât replicate, but is this 66 basis points kind of a better run rate going forward or will any of that revert?
John Patrick
It was pretty much long-term. It was a mix, we had â on the CD side, it was long-term outside the year. We did have money market specials which the cost of funds of those could ensure it has come down overtime. Again, itâs â you certainly are not going to see a seven basis point increase in cost of fund. I think it would be closer to flat than at a seven basis points, quite honestly quarter one versus prior quarter.
Gregory White
And I think it was about $35 million in CDs and $53 million in money market accounts, Travis, is the mix of the money market. The bulk of it being the money market accounts. So itâs obviously a variable and comes down. The CDs were something that we wanted to test, we thought it was good â again, funding from the balance sheet, kind of a little bit of a match funding perspective too. Hopefully in a couple of years, weâll be looking at those CDs saying wow, they were really cheap. So weâll see, but again, I thought it was a good quarter for us to test our ability get garner and get deposits by just placing an ad in the paper and it worked. 
Travis Lan
Got you. Okay. And then â but if youâre going to keep â if rates stay where they are for the rest of the year and youâre going to keep swapping out a lot of your fixed rate exposure, thatâs going to continue to cost you on the asset yield side, so is there any reason to think that NIM compression, fairly meaningful NIM compression maybe wonât continue through the rest of the year?
Gregory White
Yeah, I mean, we could â if rates stay here, we would certainly expect more compression. With that said, we historically having a really managed NIMs as much weâve managed our growth and interest income. We are going to start getting sensitive to NIM as well. Obviously, there is things we could do on the investment side. Certainly we â right now, for example, we are booking some fixed rate residential loans which will actually help our NIM, which we were selling. You saw we had very little growth in fixed rate residential during the year, you might see that book. Given the way we grew last year, we could certainly argue to take a little interest rate risk here, which would be productive toward NIM.
John Patrick
The other thing is that we take a lookout and I look at our ability to grow C&I and I think we had some nice C&I growth last year also. That obviously continues to be a primary focus of ours. Those â a lot of that C&I might be more variable rate, Travis, but it wouldnât be swapped out necessarily. So we look at all those things. If I take a look at our opportunity in Western Massachusetts, I look at that as primarily C&I driven versus commercial real estate at this point in time.
Travis Lan
Got you. Okay. All right, thatâs helpful. And obviously, you guys had kind of spoken about in prior quarters a $250 million net loan growth for 2014 a target there which you exceeded pretty handily. What do you think about loan growth heading into 2015?
Gregory White
Weâre still there because itâs really getting â itâs competitive in the marketplace. It always has been. Weâre not afraid to compete. One of the things I look at also on the commercial real estate side, Travis, is I think from what I can recall, 2015 is a peak year relative to commercial real estate either maturing or refinancing out with the conduits and a lot of insurance company paper. The insurance companies are back big time into that.
And the other thing is where we saw or where we historically didnât see some of the larger national banks, international banks playing in certain commercial real estate space. They are playing in that today, for example, a lot of times, they wouldnât have touched anything below $10 million or $20 million and theyâre down in that space too.
So thatâs why our focus is and continues to be on our C&I growth as well as commercial real estate, but I think that Iâm still comfortable with the $250 million note that we put out there relative to our loan growth going forward.
Travis Lan
Got you. All right, thatâs helpful. And then last one from me is you talked about potentially adding some more fixed rate refi but just your own outlook for the mortgage banking income line as rates have fallen have you seen activity pick up there in terms of refi and what do you expect in 2015?
Gregory White
Yeah, I think that for overall we saw a little bit of refi pick up, but our pipeline obviously has seasonality to it relative to the holidays. Weâve seen it come back strong, a lot stronger that we did last year in the early stages and recall last year we actually had this snow storm in February and we had a couple other snow storms, which I think affected peoples thought process relative to doing open houses and going out and looking at those.
I see the market a little bit stronger right now this year. Weâll see what bearing the weather has on it right now. I think itâs like three degrees outside right now. Weâre expecting snow and everything over this weekend. So that has somewhat of an impact, but we continue to remain very, very concentrated in new purchase versus refi at this time. And I see that continuing in the pipeline again being in a very consistent place.
The news for us too is weâve been doing and we havenât really added mortgage originators in that space at all. So our costs continue to, I think, improve overall in the mortgage area. And keeping in mind that weâre servicing about $400 million -- I think itâs $350 million, Iâm sorry, $335 million for others right now too. So thatâs good to build in this environment.
Travis Lan
Got you. All right, thank you guys very much.
John Patrick
Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Matthew Breese of Sterne Agee. Please go --.
John Patrick
Good morning, Matt.
Operator
One moment.
John Patrick
Sure.
Operator
Sorry. The next question is from Matthew Breese from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
Matthew Breese
Good morning, guys.
John Patrick
Good morning, Matt.
Matthew Breese
John, I was hoping you could â could you just remind us of your overall balance sheet sensitivity and how much of the commercial real estate portfolio at this point has been swapped?
Gregory White
Yeah, I think about $200 million has been swapped. Weâre slightly asset sensitive at this point in time. So we continue to be there. We think thatâs a good place to be right now. No one has navigated through this environment before. I can control â try to control a lot of things, but I canât control what rates are going to do.
And again, what I like about our growth has been even though that the margin is a little tight relative to the growth, the quality of those assets are very, very strong too. So I think that weâll continue as I said before with that growth, but we really are trying to stay as neutral or if not a little bit more eco-sensitive in this environment and continue to be that way.
Matthew Breese
Okay. And then you guys have built out over the years a very solid deposit book and I was hoping you could comment on how you think the overall deposit data will be if and when the short end of the curve just rise?
John Patrick
The overall deposit â what I am sorry?
Matthew Breese
Deposit data.
John Patrick
I think that when we take a look, weâre really focusing on that and when you take a look at our â in our releases we talk about our net new checking accounts, thatâs been our primary focus. Obviously we can lead with certain money market accounts and we want to, again from an Elko perspective and I think we talk a lot about strategy and initiation of business plans and opportunities, but we always try to prove them out, first. 
And then especially when it comes to deposits, I think that our deposit base is very, very sticky from a core perspective. And we may have â obviously we compete with that, but I donât believe that we may be as sensitive to interest rates on that side as you might think when rates do go up. I think that weâve done a nice job of cross selling into that deposit base where we are today.
Matthew Breese
Okay, now thatâs helpful. And then last one from me is, given your recent flattening of the yield curve and thinking about your loan growth projections and then potentially a lower net interest margin, do you see the need or do you have the desire to build out your non-interest income revenue streams? And if shown, what areas are you focused on?
John Patrick
Yeah. So, I take a look at that and I go back on my experience. And my experience tells me that in order to buy a wealth company or insurance company or those types of things, from a wealth perspective; I believe my basis is that you have to have a $1 billion in assets under management or at least $800 million to break-even $1 billion to be making money at it, okay. 
We are very focused on our core business of gathering deposits to making good loans. There arenât that many sizable wealth companies within the market. There is much larger banks in our marketplace that are out there actively trying to pursue wealth management and insurance opportunities. So we have not done that.
We have a strategic alliance with a $4 billion wealth company. We believe â and with actually no cost to us, so itâs a revenue sharing arrangement. What we like about the business that we have is that, a good percentage of that is recurring revenue, so itâs just not a one-time short in buying an annuity. And then secondarily, what we want to try to continue to do is, integrate that a little bit more within our C&I and our commercial operation. 
So unless there were something significant and Iâve talked to a bunch of different wealth companies along the way over the last couple of years. And most of the time, itâs somewhat either itâs getting right to retire that. Weâre going to cash out that has four or five key accounts and then at the end of the day, they go out and shop themselves. And I just donât think that we want to â I donât think thatâs per use of our shareholders dollars. 
And so, weâll effectively look to increase our fee revenue overall. I think if you take a look year-over-year, our fee revenue went up very, very nicely on just our core banking activities, not done we are charging for checking accounts and a bunch of other things that a lot of banks have implemented over the last couple of years. 
So we do have that flexibility I think to do that when the time is right or if itâs appropriate to do that from a competitor perspective in our marketplace, but I donât see us out there looking at insurance and wealth management companies to acquire to significantly enhance that. I just donât see anything in the horizon right now.
Matthew Breese
All right. I appreciate that color. Thatâs all I had. Thank you.
John Patrick
Thatâs great. Thanks.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Louis Feldman of Wells Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Louis Feldman
Good morning.
John Patrick
Good morning, Lou. How you are doing today?
Louis Feldman
Doing pretty good. Come visit here, itâs 50.
John Patrick
I know, I know. I was thinking about it, when you said youâre on.
Gregory White
But itâs really early there isnât it?
Louis Feldman
Yes, itâs 8 oâclock. In terms of your efforts too, you were building some essentially hot money deposits, longer-term you said five years, if I remember correctly.
Gregory White
Yes.
Louis Feldman
As that goes, is it your hope to be able to convert some of these into more core customers or is it â can you talk about what your marketing plan is to try and build the core deposits as you took advantage of this short-term disruption?
John Patrick
Yeah, I mean the CDPâs was kind of, if we took a look at a couple of Countyâs outside of our marketplace, okay, specifically a New Haven County and down in the Waterbury market and we said, we have absolutely no branch presence there whatsoever, we do no marketing down there whatsoever. People even know who Farmington bank is in those markets and we topped a couple ads in the newspaper and on the whole we got deposits in, we turned it off. Okay, we said okay, if our loans and deposit rates are high than ratio is high, than everybody says can you get deposits, yes. We can get deposits, you can pay for them, but you get them, but we also proved now that we have the ability to get them from a liquidity perspective.
Where we saw the opportunities and was â is indicated and especially where we kind of lead with the money market piece of it is within our own marketplace the disruption from some other banks and so as I said before the combination of branch closings from some institutions, it was a combination of a conversion that was going on, there is another company that just had a significant lay off in the marketplace that affected branch managers and things like that. And so what we try to do is disrupt their marketing around that in a variety of ways using traditional market, as well as utilizing Google analytics and other things like that relative to marketing through technology in targeted audiences.
So that again that â that has helped us, but [indiscernible] doors we have. On the commercial side, we have terrific relationships with tenders of influence to refer business to us and continue to refer business to us and our branch managers are out there and they donât â and the branches are out there calling day-in and day-out. Their primary focus is on small business and gathering deposits and weâve had some very good successes even in the first quarter for say on bringing larger new customers into the bank from a deposit perspective.
Louis Feldman
Okay, you mentioned that some of the branch managers were being terminated, anybody that you were interested in picking up for future positioning?
John Patrick
No.
Louis Feldman
All right, thatâs it from me. Thank you.
Operator
This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Patrick for any closing remarks.
John Patrick
Again, thank you. I know you guys are busy, probably took a little longer today, but that was the wrap up of the year, not just a quarter and I think our story continues to remain growing our company organically taking as minimal amount of risk as we can as we do that taking in deposits, making good loans and growing and enhancing our market and our market share within the markets that we have and continuing to develop and have the diverse balance sheet that will guide us through this challenging interest rate environment and again we are trying to manage it so we still continue to stay somewhat asset sensitive. So, when we all retire and then rates go up somebody will be able to take advantage of that. So, anyway I hope everyone has a good day. And thank you for your interest in our company.
