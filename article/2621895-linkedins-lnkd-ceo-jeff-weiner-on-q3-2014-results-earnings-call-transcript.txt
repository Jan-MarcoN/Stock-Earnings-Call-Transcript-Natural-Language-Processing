Good day and welcome to the LinkedIn Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, todayâs call is being recorded. Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Matt Sonefeldt, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Matt Sonefeldt - Head, Investor Relations
Good afternoon. Welcome to LinkedInâs third quarter 2014 results call. Joining me today to discuss our results are CEO, Jeff Weiner and CFO, Steve Sordello.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make forward-looking statements which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements relating to expected member growth and engagement, our product offerings including mobile and our product deployment process, the results of our R&D efforts, revenue including revenue growth rates of our three product lines Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, share dilution, taxes, the product mix between online and field sales, churn rates and expenses.
Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular the section entitled Risk Factors in our quarterly and annual reports, and we refer you to these filings.
Also, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the companyâs performance. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables in our earnings release. This conference call is also being broadcast on the web and is available through the Investor Relations section of the LinkedIn website.
With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Jeff Weiner.
Jeff Weiner - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Matt and welcome to todayâs conference call. I will start by summarizing the operating results for the third quarter of 2014 and I will recap some of the key milestones highlighting our strategy. I will then turn it over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers and outlook.
In the third quarter, LinkedIn made significant progress against many of the long-term strategic investments we began this year. We also saw solid growth across all of our key member ecosystem metrics and delivered strong financial results. For Q3, overall revenues grew 45% to $568 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $151 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.52. Our internal member metrics for Q3 shows steady network expansion and improved growth and engagement as measured by unique visiting members and member pageviews despite the challenging year-over-year comparisons. During Q3, cumulative members grew 28% to 332 million, unique visiting members grew 16% to an average of 90 million per month and member pageviews grew 28%, well ahead of unique member growth. This led to a year-over-year increase in member pageviews per unique visiting member underscoring our strengthening organic engagement driven in part by execution on our content strategy.
Mobile also continues to drive an increasing amount of value we bring to members. Unique visiting members coming from mobile devices grew nearly three times faster than overall uniques. Mobile now accounts for 47% of total traffic to LinkedIn. LinkedIn helps professionals build and manage their identities, create and leverage their professional networks, and gain the knowledge they need to be more successful in their careers. Today, we do this for more than 300 million professionals around the world, but our vision is much larger to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce by building the economic graph. To that end, in 2014, we initiated several strategic long-term investments. We want to highlight some of the recent developments against a few of those key initiatives.
Increasing the scale and relevance of jobs on LinkedIn has been a major investment this year. This is consistent with the core value proposition we delivered to our members helping them find the right jobs and the right jobs find them. In May, accelerated by the acquisition of Bright, we began to add hundreds of thousands of open job listings from U.S. companies to the platform targeted to active jobseekers. Last month, we extended this effort to include jobs from around the world. We are now approaching 2 million listings, a first step in achieving our goal to have every available job in the world on LinkedIn. In Q3, we also saw strong momentum for our Jobs mobile app. Members using LinkedIn Jobs are viewing four times as many open positions compared with other mobile-engaged members and they are applying to twice as many jobs. The growth of our professional publishing platform has been another area of strategic investment in 2014. In the third quarter, we continued to build towards our goal of having all of the worldâs professionally relevant knowledge accessible through LinkedIn. We accelerated the ongoing rollout of our long-form publishing capability to more than 100 million members.
Earlier this month, we also began ramping our next generation authoring and publishing feature, which simplifies the experience of writing on LinkedIn. We are now approaching 40,000 posts published per week by our members. And our content publishing platform is the fastest growing driver of member engagements. We also continue to focus on growing LinkedIn beyond our current member base, increasingly focusing on developing countries and younger demographics. In Q3, approximately 75% of new members came to LinkedIn from outside the U.S., with China providing particular strength. China has quickly emerged as a large contributor to network growth in recent months.
Students remain another rapidly growing part of our network, increasing nearly three times faster in Q3 compared with overall member growth. Beginning in October, we released new tools to help high school and college students better navigate the start of their careers. Students can now use university rankings and other analytics products to make informed decisions about which school to attend and what to study by leveraging data from millions of alumni. And we have seen some universities begin to leverage their LinkedIn ranking to attract high quality applicants.
Creating value for all of our members enables us to deliver useful offerings to customers of our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions products. These product lines transform the way our customers hire, market and sell on a global basis. In Q3, Talent Solutions grew 45% to $345 million; Marketing Solutions was up 45% to $109 million and Premium Subscriptions increased 43% to $114 million.
Within Talent Solutions, our goal is to power the worldâs hires, increasingly achievable as the LinkedIn network expands globally. At our annual Talent Connect conference last week, we previewed for nearly 4,000 attendees powerful new search capability in our flagship Recruiter product. New tools allow recruiters and hiring managers to find professionals that are not just great fits for specific jobs, but identify the best possible fit for their particular companies. This functionality will be available beginning in 2015.
In Marketing Solutions, we furthered the strategic shift towards content marketing with the continued ramp of sponsored updates, now 31% of Marketing Solutions. Sponsored updates momentum and our recent Bizo acquisition are driving our evolution to becoming a leading end-to-end B2B marketing platform. We were excited to welcome and integrate the Bizo team in Q3.
Within Subscriptions, the third quarter saw the launch of the new Sales Navigator, complemented by our well-attended Sales Connect customer events in San Francisco and London. We have received positive feedback and strong interest from a wide range of customers. SAP represents an early, but important example of a company seeing the value of social selling at scale, signing one of the largest contracts in LinkedInâs history to implement Sales Navigator.
Finally, I want to highlight how we continue to build LinkedInâs own talent, our number one operating priority as a company. Q3 was a record hiring quarter, driven by strong new college grad recruiting and on-boarding software engineers at the fastest rate in the companyâs history. The launch of our San Francisco R&D office, the first in the U.S. dedicated to product and engineering outside Silicon Valley, should only add to our ability to attract top talent and strengthen our culture.
And now, I will turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials.
Steve Sordello - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Jeff. Today, I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise. And non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles and the tax impacts of these adjustments. LinkedIn demonstrated strength in the third quarter leveraging the scale of our member base to drive growth across all three lines of business. At the same time we made meaningful progress against many of the long-term investments we set out to make in 2014.
During the third quarter member and engagement metrics remained healthy. Unique visiting member growth increased to 16% versus 13% last quarter and member pageview growth increased to 28% versus 22%. We are encouraged by member activity especially given the difficult comparisons versus last yearâs elevated levels of traffic which we discussed last quarter.
With regard to monetization all three product lines generated strong growth leading to $568 million in revenue, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Talent Solutions showed steady performance growing 45% year-over-year to $345 million representing 61% of sales versus 60% last year. Field sales which comprised 76% of Talents Solutions revenue showed balanced execution between new customer acquisitions and relationship management reflecting our land and expand strategy.
On new customer acquisition, our sales force improved quota attainment year-over-year, with particularly strong performance in Europe. We continued to expand our customer base, with total customers under contract growing 38% year-over-year to over 30,000. Churn rates remain stable and our net ratio continues to outpace our expectations for the year. In addition, the online channel generated solid performance with jobseeker subscription providing nice results.
And finally, this afternoon we announced a price increase to field sales customers, effective January 1 on new contracts and renewals. Similar to our last 2013 increase, there will be a mid-single digit impact for customers and will be effective in the majority of geographies where we operate. We strive to take a thoughtful approach to pricing as we build long-term relationships with customers. Since our last price change in 2013, we have increased the member base by over 30%, widening the pool of potential talent and introduced more than 30 enhancements to our product portfolio.
Marketing Solutions grew 45% to $109 million, representing 19% of total sales consistent with last year. Growth was driven by overall increases in customer spending, continued Sponsored Updates traction and a small contribution from Bizo more than offsetting headwinds in the display portion of the business. Existing customers are increasing overall spend with LinkedIn as the content marketing value proposition continues to resonate. This is illustrated by substantial growth in the number of customers buying multiple products, increasing over 60% year-over-year.
In the quarter, Sponsored Updates increased to approximately a third of Marketing Solutions revenue versus the high single-digits last year. Customer adoption continued to ramp, with direct Sponsored Content launch particularly impactful, now driving a quarter of Sponsored Updates campaigns. As we look towards next year, we expect that two of our key 2014 investments should increasingly drive the business establishing a broader auction-based content platform by building on the success of Sponsored Updates and leveraging Bizo to begin building an end-to-end B2B offering. Taken together, these initiatives will increasingly drive future Marketing Solutions growth.
Premium Subscriptions grew 43% to $114 million contributing 20% of revenue, consistent with last year. General Subscriptions continues to represent the majority of premium revenue. During the quarter, we began re-envisioning how we more effectively deliver value to subscribers by reducing SKUs, streamlining access to our products and standardizing free trials. This initiative will ramp more broadly during Q4 and in 2015 is expected to increase both total paid members and the overall lifetime value of a subscriber. While the free trial element will create a short-term revenue headwind, we are excited to deliver an overall higher quality premium experience for our members that will positively impact the business over the long-term.
Sales Solutions approximately a quarter of premium subscriptions today grew at a much faster pace. The launch of the new Sales Navigator represents the beginning of another large SaaS opportunity for LinkedIn. To-date, Sales Navigator growth has been driven primarily by individual self-serve subscribers, but over time, we expect the field sales component to drive the majority of Sales Solutions. As it scales over the next several years, this new product line should increasingly add greater diversity and visibility to our overall business.
In Q3, the field sales force focused on customer transition and we are off to a positive start. To-date, we have migrated 70% of existing field sales customers to the new product, with a healthy rate of renewals and add-ons, a good indicator of value delivered. As we enter our first full quarter with the new Sales Navigator, we are excited to begin educating customers on how social selling transforms the way they sell. In terms of geography, we continue to become more global across the business. International represents 40% of overall revenue versus 38% last year. By channel, field sales contributed 60% of revenue versus 58% last year.
Moving to the non-GAAP financials, revenue outperformance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $151 million, a 27% margin compared to $93 million and a 24% margin last year. Depreciation and amortization totaled $60 million while stock compensation was $83 million. On taxes, GAAP expense was $13 million, while non-GAAP expense was $36 million, reflecting the static 35% non-GAAP tax rate we expect throughout 2014. GAAP net loss was $4 million resulting in a $0.03 loss per share similar to last year. Non-GAAP net income was $66 million resulting in earnings of $0.52 per share compared with $47 million and $0.39 last year.
The balance sheet remains strong with $2.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, including the impact from acquisitions and our investments in our datacenters and facilities. We delivered record quarterly operating and free cash flow of $181 million and $61 million respectively during the quarter.
I will end the call with guidance for the fourth quarter and an updated outlook for 2014. For revenue, we are raising our expectations for both Q4 and the full year. We expect Q4 to range between $600 million and $605 million, 35% growth at the midpoint. And for the full year, we expect to range between $2.17 billion and $2.18 billion, a 42% annual growth rate compared to the 40% reflected in prior guidance.
Given the size of strategic investments throughout 2014, we are pleased with the level of profitability the company has achieved. For Adjusted EBITDA we expect Q4 to range between $153 million and $155 million, a 26% margin at the midpoint. And for the full year, we are raising our outlook to between $566 million and $568 million, a 26% margin at the midpoint and up from the prior range $545 million to $550 million. Lastly we expect non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.49 for Q4 and approximately $1.89 for the full year.
Additional guidance inputs include depreciation of $59 million for Q4 and $203 million for the full year, with fourth quarter amortization of $12 million and $34 million for the full year. Stock based compensation of $96 million for Q4 and $321 million for the full year. A non-GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 and fully diluted weighted shares of approximately 127 million for Q4 and 126 million for the full year.
In closing, we are pleased with the results generated in the third quarter with revenue strength leading to positive leverage and cash flow. We continue to invest towards realizing our long-term vision for both our member and customer platforms. These investments allow us to continue to scaling the level of members, companies, jobs, skills, schools and knowledge towards the goal of building the worldâs first economic graph.
Thank you for your time. And we will now take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Paul Vogel of Barclays.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Thanks so much for the question. When you think about increasing be the free trials for the premium members, can you just I guess talk about that from a big picture in terms of how you think about both the free and paid subscription, there is obviously a lot more you can get as a paid subscriber and the products you want to have under one umbrella versus the other and versus potentially just not having a paid service at all which would increase the overall audience and the frequency with which people visit LinkedIn?
Jeff Weiner
Yes. I mean we have always drawn a clear distinction between the fact that the vast majority of activity on LinkedIn is free and will continue to be. This â the move towards greater consistency on free trialing is part of an effort that our subscriptions team recently undertook to really orient the flow and the funnel around key value propositions. And those are finding a job, our job seeker package, our recruiter package in terms of the ability to hire folks online, the sales navigator capability. And we are going to continue to orient around these more distinct value propositions going forward. In the past we have done free trialing in particular pockets, but it hasnât necessarily been consistent across the board. And so thatâs really what this was driving towards this greater consistency.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Okay. And just a quick follow-up, how do you just think about the level of service you get in your premium versus non-premium obviously in terms of seeing who viewed your profile and being able to be to send emails and those types of things, how do you just sort of balance whatâs appropriate for both?
Jeff Weiner
Itâs a great question and something we have been digging into quite a bit lately. And one of the key distinctions for us is going to be commercial usage intent where we can very clearly see where people are coming in conducting searches on a commercial basis. And so thatâs one of the areas that we want to draw a clear line on. Historically, as you alluded to itâs also possible to connect and communicate with folks that you havenât necessarily forged a formal relationship with on LinkedIn and thatâs a core value proposition. And for each of those distinct segments job seeker, hiring managers and recruiters the sales people etcetera we are going to continue to push forward in terms of making those value propositions even clear.
Paul Vogel - Barclays
Thanks so much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Scott Devitt of Stifel.
Scott Devitt - Stifel
Hi. Thanks. Congratulations on your continued success. And I had two, first for Jeff. We are seeing quite a bit of positive trends in user growth and engagement and at just 50,000 feet. But if you go back a couple of years, when you first doubled down on professional content and the other engagement-related initiatives, how do you think you performed relative to your goals and where do you think you can improve, both short-term and long-term? And then secondly, for Steve, in regards to Sales Navigator, do you expect 4Q to be seasonally strong for add-ons and renewals the same way it has been for Talent Solutions? Thank you.
Jeff Weiner
Thanks, Scott. So, in terms of the longer term plan, I think we continue to execute and very clear about where we are investing areas like the publishing platform, where we recently announced we invited our 100 millionth member to participate in terms of long-form content sharing. We continue to invest aggressively in the number of jobs, which is not so much a monetization effort, but it is an effort to create more value for active and passive jobseekers on LinkedIn through greater job liquidity. We continue to invest very aggressively in mobile, which is growing much faster than our desktop offerings. And we just surpassed 47% of weekly unique visiting via mobile kind of continue to invest in that multi-app portfolio strategy. So, along those lines, I think things continue to go according to plan. There is a long way to go. And I think going forward two of the things â at least two of the things that we want to get better at are helping members to better understand the value we are capable of offering. There is a lot of functionality thatâs been introduced on LinkedIn over the last couple of years. And I think we can do a better job of enabling members to discover that functionality and distribute them. The right applications are going to create value for those members.
And along those same lines, we want to do a better job of understanding member intention. What are our membersâ objectives? And I think there is at least three ways we can do that today. One of which we kind of already covered, which is inferring that from their profile information who they are connected to, what they are following. But I think we can also just explicitly do a better job of asking what members are trying to accomplish. And in doing so, I think we are going to be able to drive a better experience and subsequently higher engagement. And then again through this multi-app portfolio strategy, we can see what members are actually doing, what applications they are activating, how they are using those applications. And I think thatâs also going to enable us to get a better understanding of what they are trying to accomplish.
Steve Sordello
And Scott, in terms of the seasonality of Sales Solutions, yes in general, we would expect Sales Solutions to be seasonally stronger in Q4 similar to recruiter. A couple of things to note currently with the product, itâs currently less than 40% field sales. So, there is still this migration happening as we transition from the old Sales Navigator to the new flagship product that will partly impact that growth. There is a lot of education going on as we transition. We have had some positive start and some good early wins, including the SAP deal, which is one of our largest deals ever. But one thing I just want people to recognize is this is a new product. We just launched it in August. And there is a transition period both from the online to the field as well as just education in the marketplace as itâs quite a transformative service.
Scott Devitt - Stifel
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Great, thanks. Just a question on Sales Navigator, could you provide further details on the overall customersâ reception to the new Sales Navigator and can you update us on the total number of salespeople selling the product? And maybe color on their initial sales effort? Thank you.
Jeff Weiner
Yes, I will start. Yes, early days, positive start, I mentioned that we are focused on migration. So, we started to focus the field sales. We are about 70% migrated on that side to the new product. Most of the anecdotal feedback so far has been on the product basis and positive. We have seen really healthy add-on renewals, which is I think is a more direct indicator of the ROI that we are seeing with the solution, again early days. We are currently on a headcount basis about 160 reps, thatâs up from about 70 a year ago. And we are still expanding it. We had a strategy with this product to ramp the sales force and align it with the rollout of the product and we have done that, but we are still ramping towards the end of this year. And we have actually pulled in some of the hires from next year into Q4, the planned hires.
Steve Sordello
And Jeff, I would add to that a few things. The team did a really nice job getting that product out when they did. Itâs was a big effort. A lot of time and energy went into making that possible. We had a good inaugural kickoff event here in San Francisco with Sales Connect, took that to London. And as Steve mentioned, the feedback has been good. We are hearing whatâs working for folks and just as importantly where we can improve. And with any new product, obviously, we want to pay very close attention to that and start moving the needle and meeting the needs of customers to the best of our ability. The only other thing I would add is that a lot of focus thus far has been on migrating customers from our legacy product to this new product. And I think the team is doing a nice job handling that transition. That can be tricky and complex. And once we get through that, weâre going to be able to really focus 100% of our attention on the new product.
John Blackledge - Cowen & Company
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to the engagement metrics that accelerated in the quarter. Can you just talk to how much was driven more through the specific products or perhaps what youâre seeing in China as well, you kind of pointed that out as a very strong push, trying to understand the contribution there? And then also, when we think about China, usage obviously picking up, how do you think about the monetization plan in that market around recruiter and the right timing for that? Thanks.
Jeff Weiner
Sure. Iâll start with the China part of the question. So China is certainly contributing on member growth. China has become the second largest contributor to new sign-ups on a daily basis after only the United States. When we announced our localization efforts back in February, we were at about roughly 4 million members, and that took over 10 years to amass, and by the end of Q3, we were at roughly 6 million members. So weâre showing good traction there. We have a long ways to go in terms of making sure we have the right local product in place, itâs not just about sign-ups, itâs about making sure weâre delivering value to those members. And so itâs very early days on that front, so I think a ways to go in terms of a material driver of engagement.
With regard to the acceleration, I mentioned this earlier, but mobile has certainly contributed. Our multi-app strategy continues to pay off. Our connected app certainly is doing very well and driving higher daily engagement than weâve seen traditionally. Weâve got some other exciting mobile apps in the pipeline. And then the publishing platform, while growing off of a smaller base has become our fastest growing product with regard to engagement on a year-over-year basis. And that of course is in-part driven by inviting an increasingly larger number of people to participate, in terms of creating content for the platform.
Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator

Your next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie.
Tom White - Macquarie
Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys had a nice quarter there in terms of the net CSC adds. In your last earnings call you discussed, kind of plans to hire new 100 sales people in the second half of this year. Could you maybe just update us on where you are with that? Were those new folks in seats early enough to be sort of productive and impact the third quarter trends or is it really Europe thatâs kind of driving the strength in the CSC adds? Thanks.

Jeff Weiner
Well, really itâs just overall I think with the execution and strength. We did pull in some of the hunters, but obviously the ramp time for typically hunter is longer than the cycle as we spoke about it. Weâre currently at about little over 800 head count in selling and talent solutions. Weâre continuing to grow that probably 40% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, which is pulling a little from next year. The mix between the relationship managers and hunters is still roughly 55-45, maybe shifting a little more towards hunters, as we talked about last time, the opportunity in terms of our penetrable pipeline continuing to grow and taking advantage of that through pulling in head count.
Tom White - Macquarie
Thank you.
Operator

Your next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse.
Steven Ju - Credit Suisse
Thanks. So Steve, any change in how youâre allocating your R&D dollars now with Sales Navigator already shift, and how much are you devoting to existing products and how much is going towards products that are as of yet unannounced? And Jeff, what in the behavior of a user base is informing the decision to keep a portfolio of single-purpose apps, as opposed to multi-purpose app, and what do you think the benefits will be over the longer term? Thanks.
Steve Sordello
On the R&D question, so the vast majority of our R&D spend goes towards our member platform, which is the core products, including things like the home page search, a number of new initiatives that we talked about, the publishing platform, China, scaling, jobs and the relevancy of jobs, mobile, the student initiatives, things of that nature. So thatâs the vast majority of investment. We also have a number of other areas on kind of more of the monetization side, our marketing solutions, the sponsored content and the B2B, which includes the acquisition components of that integration. And then Sales Navigator is still an investment area. Weâre still continuing to refine the product. So I would say no major shift. We tend to as a philosophy allocate about 70% of our investment spend towards core products and other 20% towards strategic and roughly 10% towards venture. That really hasnât shifted materially because of the Sales Navigator launch.
Jeff Weiner
And with regard to single-purpose app versus multi-purpose app, itâs really a byproduct of the way in which members, and not just members of LinkedIn, but consumers are utilizing apps on their phone, thereâs less real estate, less time. They want to solve for their objectives as quickly as possible. They want to complete those tasks as quickly as possible. And so, the clear you can be in terms of context, the more intuitive those applications can operate, the more value you can add to that end user, in our case, our members. The jobseeker app would be a great example of that. Connected is another great example. That functionality is resident within flagship linkedin.com on the desktop, but itâs comingled with the number of other used cases.
On a mobile device, you can see very quickly the people in your network and what they are up to. Work anniversaries, promotions, mentioned in the news through our Newsle acquisition. And increasingly, we want to better understand the intention of our members, and we want to be solving for those intentions as quickly as we can. And the clear we can be with regard to context in which we deliver that, I think the more value weâre going to be able to add. A notable exception would be something like our flagship application, thatâs the app you open up when you press on our logo through your phone. And of course when you type-in linkedin.com, and even there we think there are opportunities to get more focused around value propositions. And then use that as a jumping off point to enable our members to discover other value proportions on LinkedIn and then distribute those members into the right application.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse

Your next question comes from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef, your line is open.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Yes, hi. Sorry about that. Two quick questions. First, I guess, theyâre both probably for Steve. What accounted for the improved code attainment that you called out on the â in your prepared remarks for the sales force? And then second, with regards to the price increase of the mid single-digits, can you just help us understand maybe the decision for the timing of that, is that now an annual phenomenon that we should expect and help us or just remind us for last yearâs churn as a result of the last price increase? Thanks.
Steve Sordello
Yes, I would say, just generally in the quarter, the fundamentals just remain strong. We had just good execution across the board, particularly on a relative basis in Europe. And again, across new bookings with new customer additions as well as kind of add-ons and renewals, all remained healthy in the quarter. So nothing, I think other than that to really call out. In terms of the price increase, this is the first one since kind of mid-2013. And just to set the stage, this is again a mid-single digit, so very similar in most of our geographies, so very similar to the one a couple of years ago.
In terms of pricing, weâve always had a philosophy of really trying to optimize the long-term relationship, as with the customer as opposed to maximizing the pricing power in any given moment. And so, we â in terms of price increasing, really reflected that. Now, since a couple of years ago, weâve continued to grow the member base, itâs 30% larger. Weâve continued to add a lot of product functionality and we talked about 30 â over 30 enhancements to the product. So we are on a â every year we evaluate this. It doesnât mean that weâre going to moving to an annual cadence, but weâre evaluating every year relative to that relationship. And the other thing, I just want to point out in terms of the price increase is this is effective January of next year for new contracts and renewals. And the vast majority of our renewals happen in Q4, about 40%. So this is really impacting the back-half of next year and into 2016.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald

And on churn?
Steve Sordello
Say it again? Oh! churn.
Youssef Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald
Just trying to figure out what last yearâs churn was as a result of the price increase, just to kind of see what kind of the churn expectations we may see?
Steve Sordello
Yes. So we didnât really see any impact on churn from the previous price increase. And our churn rates have been relatively stable over the last year. So we donât expect any material impact there.

Your next question comes from Brian Nowak of AIG.
Brian Nowak - AIG
Thanks so much. I have two please. First one on the Talent Solutionsâ net additions, again, I guess can you talk to the increased hiring around the hunters? Were there any specific industries or size of customers, SMBs, large enterprises that you have recently found as new opportunities that have caused you to really raise the hunter hiring is the first one? And then the second one is on sponsored content kind of learning that you have so far and areas you still see for improvement or you can increase the overall pace of the add ramp? Thanks.
Steve Sordello
Sure. Yes, on the net customer additions incrementally more on the SMB side, but pretty strong across the board. Our SMB mix right now on a revenue basis is mid 30% range. Last year, it was about low 30% as we have been â the mix has been going more towards the smaller company we have been able to maintain a record ARPU, which means that we are continuing to sell deeper into the large accounts to offset that mix shift, but pretty much across the Board with a little bit of strength, with a little bit of relative waiting towards SMB.

With regard of Sponsored Updates, we are very pleased with the results thus far. Over the last year, Sponsored Updates has emerged as the fastest growing business we have had in the companyâs history. And I think thatâs a testament to the job that the team did with the products and then their go-to-market efforts and we continue to see good momentum there. I think going forward some of the things that could enable us to grow even further or continuing to grow on the current trajectory would be facilitating the way in which people can leverage our APIs creating more robust functionality there with regard to our partner relationships.
And then on the matching front with regards to targeting capabilities broad match in terms of our relevancy efforts, I think there is room for improvement on that front, but we are very pleased with the result of Sponsored Updates thus far to-date. One additional thing worth noting is the potential at the intersection of Bizo and the ability to nurture leads across the web, not just on LinkedIn, not just leveraging traditional display advertising, but also our sponsored content capability as well. And I know the team is looking forward to rolling up their sleeves and making that integration happen as well.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets
Thanks. I want to go back to the comments about the content strategy, how thatâs been able to strengthen organic engagement. And I wonder if you could peel that back a little bit and maybe single out a few elements of the content strategy? And then just going forwards which elements of the content strategy do you think have been most successful in driving that engagement? And then whatâs the product pipeline look like in terms of the content strategy going forward? Is there still â are we low hanging fruit, are we mid hanging fruit, where are we in terms of â what kind of the impact changes in content strategy can have in the future in driving engagement? Thank you.
Jeff Weiner
Yes. So, some of the things that we have been focused on thus far, Mark. I would start with liquidity content, liquidity and growing our publisher capability, our publishing platform capability from the roughly 500 professional luminaries that we started with roughly 2 years ago to over 100 million members that have been invited to contribute today and that number will continue to grow to encompass the entire membership base and we are now seeing north of 40,000 original posts being generated on a weekly basis. Thatâs our original content. That goes well beyond status updates. We are going to continue focus on relevancy and making sure that both within the feed and within our content digest, we are getting the right content from the right person at the right time. And I think that has certainly helped in terms of some of the strong growth that we have seen thus far. I think there is more low hanging fruit on that front and getting our content experience right in the feed.
I think there is certainly upside with regard to our multi-app strategy and Pulse has done some groundbreaking work in terms of mobile news reading. And we think there are some exciting places that we can take that product on a going forward basis and that would apply not just on mobile, but on desktop as well. We also want to continue to invest in our publisher relationships with third-party publishers that are a big part of our publishing platform ecosystem and making sure that we have the right content from across the web to meet the needs of our members. So, those are some of the variables and some of the areas that have driven growth that you have seen thus far to-date and those are going to be areas we continue to invest in on a going forward basis.

Your next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great, thanks. In light of a big social company doing a big investment push here, Jeff maybe talk a little bit about how you feel about your staffing levels relative to all the interesting projects you have going on? And then Steve on the revenue guidance, I think 35% -- I think you mentioned a couple of things maybe the headwinds near-term, but could you talk a little bit about FX and then the impact on Premium Subscriptions the changes there on revenue growth and then anything else to call out on that? Thank you.
Jeff Weiner
Itâs a great point with regard to R&D staffing in terms of fulfilling our potential as the platform and executing on our roadmap, this is a very challenging environment in terms of supply and demand for the best technical talent, the best R&D talent. And we have been very pleased to see over the last few quarters growing momentum not only in terms of the numbers of people we have been able to bring on board and to hire, but the quality of people. That bar continues to remain very high, if not actually be moving higher. So, we are in a good place there, but we are going to need to remain very focused on continuing that path in order to continue to build the kinds of products that we want to build going forward.
Steve Sordello
And on in terms of the guidance, so first of all, we are increasing the guidance for both Q4 and the year. Just to give a little color specifically on the member side, we expect the unique visitors and pageviews to continue to modestly accelerate going into Q4. On Talent Solutions, pretty much consistent performance. We are more aggressively investing in the sales force ahead of â15. On Marketing Solutions, we have really good momentum in terms of the sponsored content. There is a display headwind, which you know is offsetting that somewhat. And we continue to invest in the option platform and the B2B opportunity with Bizo in â15. Premium, which we spoke about a little bit ago, this is where we are making some changes to the on-boarding and standardizing some of the free trial efforts. This is having an impact in terms of the guidance that we would expect a dip in terms of the percentage of revenue thatâs premium subscription in Q4, again with a longer term benefit of lifetime value and a longer term opportunity.
In terms of FX really we are not that impacted by it given that 70% of our business is in USD and over 60% is rateable subscription business in terms of how the billing works. So itâs less than a $2 million impact for us this quarter and itâs pretty mitigated given the USD and rateable recognition in billing.
Justin Post - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. I appreciate that.

Your next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs.
Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs
Thanks. I know we touched on this a little bit but I am curious what you think the hurdles are from here in terms of getting marketing mix from mobile up over the 50% the way your traffic mix is built. And maybe a little more specifically as you have gotten into â gotten deeper into the integration of Bizo, what do you see Bizo enabling advertisers to do on LinkedIn, they really havenât been able to do before and when do you see it beginning to enable the off-LinkedIn opportunity that you have talked about?
Jeff Weiner
So with regard to the first part of the question in terms of mobile and thatâs just going to follow continuing growth in mobile engagement and making sure that we have a multi-app strategy in place. Our first focus there is on the member and making sure we have the right experience for them. And there is going to be opportunities to start thinking about how we integrate things like sponsored content in the future in a number of different applications to go beyond the flagship which is the only place thatâs available today. In terms of Bizo one of the simplest differences going forward is going to be for the ability of these marketers to not only be able to target prospects on LinkedIn, but nurture relationships, targeting nurture relationships off of LinkedIn. And we are excited to bring that capability to our customers and I know they are looking forward to getting that integration up and running as quickly as we can.

We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Bill Bird of FBR.
Bill Bird - FBR
Thank you. On Sponsored Updates, could you tell us what percentage of the inventory you sold? I believe your sell-through was around 50% last quarter and maybe you could talk a little bit about just how that business is developing outside the U.S.? Thank you.
Steve Sordello
So, the percentage sell-through pretty much is holding around that level. In terms of outside the U.S., it actually is Sponsored Update is more weighted relative to display outside the U.S. given the high percentage of relative online revenue there. So itâs a little bit more weighted relative to our display side of the business outside the U.S. That being said a lot of the revenue thatâs driven off of sponsored update is homepage driven opportunity. And the initiatives we have on the content side are more fully developed in the domestic market. So as we continue to grow those opportunities outside the U.S. in terms of the content strategy that will create more inventory available for sponsored updates.
Bill Bird - FBR
Great. Thank you.
Jeff Weiner - Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Thatâs going to conclude the call. Thank you so much for your time. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.
