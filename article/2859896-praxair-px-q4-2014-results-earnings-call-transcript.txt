Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q4 2014 Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tia, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct the question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Kelcey Hoyt
Thanks, Tia. Good morning and thank you for attending our fourth quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our Web site at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. Please also note that our discussion of earnings for the full year and fourth quarter including year-over-year and sequential comparisons excludes fourth quarter 2014 adjustments related to the Venezuela currency devaluation, a bond redemption and pension settlement charge, as well as previously disclosed adjustments in 2013. These items are detailed and reconciled to the reported GAAP numbers in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.
Matt and I will now review Praxair's 2014 full year and fourth quarter results, as well as our outlook for 2015 including earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.
Matt White
Thanks, Kelcey and good morning, everyone. Iâd like to open up the call by providing a recap of 2014 and then Iâll cover the 2015 outlook after Kelceyâs review of our results. We performed well in 2014 despite significant challenges as our operational and capital discipline enabled us to deliver strong earnings within our original guidance range. Price attainment and cost control were achieved in all operating segments. The U.S. on-site, merchant and packaged gas businesses improved across most end-markets. Our South American team grew the underlying business mid single-digits for the year. Europe was stable and the business achieved an operating margin expansion of over 100 basis points.
In Asia, India accelerated as China decelerated. Globally, new plant start-ups and acquisitions contributed to growth. As you may recall in early 2014, our guidance outlook was based on some key assumptions including a very flat economic performance in Brazil of 3% currency headwind and low to mid single-digit growth in the rest of the world. While we tracked well to this guidance in the first half of the year, we faced several headwinds in the latter half. The last two quarters of 2014 saw a deep recession in Brazil, a significant and unexpected slowdown in the energy market in Mexico and a substantial devaluation of virtually every foreign currency.
Despite these unexpected headwinds, we grew sales and operating profit for the year at 6% and earnings per share of 9%, excluding currency. We continue to deliver solid execution and productivity combined with industry-leading return on capital and return on equity that allowed us to grow EPS even faster. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2.9 billion, which represented 23% of sales and a record free cash flow of $1.2 billion.
Full year EBITDA and operating margins grew to new highs of 32.2% and 22.4% respectively, which exemplifies the discipline and execution of the Praxair team around the world. In addition to our strong operational performance, we prudently managed our capital structure by investing $1.8 billion of capital expenditures and acquisitions toward future growth, while returning $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and net stock repurchases. The resiliency of our business model and stability of cash flow generation enables us to consistently return capital to shareholders, especially in times of more moderate growth. In fact, we just announced a 10% dividend increase today, which speaks to our confidence of future cash flow generation.
However, we know there is still room for improvement and we cannot standstill. We continuously adjust our business structure to be aligned with changes in macroeconomic conditions. Consequently, during the fourth quarter we executed a series of additional cost actions across most operating segments to better position us for the current growth environment. The related severance charges of about $15 million are included in the fourth quarter operating results and are expected at a payback of approximately one-year. So while 2014 ended with volatility around commodity pricing and foreign currencies, we continue to focus on the things within our control to improve upon our leadership position.
Now Iâll turn the call back over to Kelcey, whoâll review our 2014 results in more detail.
Kelcey Hoyt
Thanks, Matt. Please turn to Slide 3 for an overview of the full year. As Matt commented earlier, our results in 2014 were solid. Overall sales were $12.3 billion, up 6% versus the prior year ex-currency. Organic sales growth came primarily from increased volumes in the Americas and Asia, including new plant start-ups as well as higher overall pricing across all operating segments. End-market growth year-over-year was broad-based including manufacturing, metals, food and beverage, energy, chemical and healthcare. Operating profit of $2.7 billion grew 6% year-over-year excluding foreign currency from higher pricing, volume growth, productivity savings and acquisitions. In addition, we grew full year EBITDA and operating margins to record levels.
During 2014, our productivity initiatives again exceeded our targeted savings of at least 5% of our cost stack. These efforts are not an annual or quarterly event, but something that all employees are working toward on a daily basis. The constant focus on generating productivity initiatives, executing them and replicating them globally typically within the areas of production, procurement and distribution offsets inflation in our cost structure. One additional benefit is that a little more than 25% of our savings came from what we call sustainable productivity initiatives with the largest being energy efficiency improvements in our plants and distribution fleet.
Net income of $1.9 billion increased 5% from the prior year. Our key leverage metrics including the debt-to-capital ratio increased to 59.6%, primarily due to the impact of negative currency translation on the capital base, while the debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times. During 2014, we issued euro denominated notes of 1.1 billion in two tranches with 6 to 11 year terms at an average of interest rate of 1.6%. We were able to take advantage of low interest rates and our tight issue spreads to treasuries. At year-end about 80% of our debt was fixed rate and about 20% was floating rate, as we have significantly reduced our exposure to rising interest rates. Our after-tax return on capital for the year was 12.7%, capital project spend and acquisitions are typically dilutive to return on capital and below the corporate average for at least the first several years. We expect return on capital to trend upward as earnings grows faster than the capital base. We maintained a healthy return on equity of 28.7%.
Please turn to Slide 4 for an overview of cash flow. Through consistent capital and operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year which was equal to 23% of sales. 1.8 billion of CapEx projects and acquisitions was prudently invested for growth and density improvement. 1.5 billion was returned to shareholders equally in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Capital spending in 2014 was $1.7 billion with almost half of the CapEx spend occurring in North America, about 20% in South America and about 15% each in Asia and Europe. During 2015, the distribution of spend across geographies is expected to be similar with an increase in spend in the U.S. Gulf Coast offset by a decrease in Europe.
We spend at least $500 million annually on maintenance CapEx and about $100 million on cost reduction projects that typically include plant efficiency improvements. The remainder of the capital spending is for new production plants under contract with customers, as well as distribution equipment which support sales and earnings growth. In 2014, we invested $114 million in acquisitions net of divestitures. We acquired several core industrial gas tuck-in acquisitions including seven U.S. packaged gas distributors, full ownership of our U.S. Mid-Atlantic joint venture and Messerâs Italian business. We continue to look selectively for acquisitions in our core gases business, which are high quality, low risk properties where we can bring synergies to the business we are buying and where we can achieve an attractive return on investment.
This morning we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2015, which represents our 22nd consecutive annual increase. This is consistent with our policy of growing dividends each year at least in line with earnings growth. During 2014, we reduced our outstanding share count by 1%. This was our 5th consecutive year of reducing the share count by at least by 1% and $1 billion remains available under the current $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We expect to continue our strong cash flow generation and our stock buyback program to reduce the share count, without diminishing our credit rating or access to low cost funding.
Please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter sales were $3 billion and grew 3% over 2013 ex-currency. Organic sales increased from higher volumes and higher pricing in the Americas and Asia. Sales were higher primarily to the manufacturing, metals, food and beverage and healthcare end-markets. Sequentially underlying sales were down 2% versus the third quarter due primarily to the timing of customer turnarounds in North America, weaker volumes in Northern Europe and seasonal customer production curtailments in South America.
Operating profit was $663 million in the fourth quarter and steady with the prior year quarter excluding foreign currency. Operating profit growth was less than sales growth primarily due to the $15 million of severance charges we took during the quarter. EBITDA and operating margins remain strong at 32.3% and 22.2% respectively. Net income of $460 million was comparable to the prior year quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share of a $1.57 grew 5% ex-currency. Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $772 million represented 26% of sales and funded $482 million of capital expenditures. The Company paid a $189 million of dividends and repurchased $282 million of stock net of issuances. Our project backlog which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed customer supply contract remained steady at $1.9 billion and is comprised of 24 projects.
During the fourth quarter we signed two long-term contracts for new projects located in Northern Europe and started three plants located in the Americas and Asia. Our backlog remains diverse with projects in North America and Asia each representing about one-third of the capital expenditures in the backlog and the rest in Europe and South America. These projects will serve customers in the chemical, metals, manufacturing, energy and electronics end-markets.
Please turn to Page 6 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion 3% above the prior year quarter, excluding negative currency impact. Underlying sales growth of 2% was primarily driven by higher volumes in merchant and packaged gases, as well as higher pricing. Acquisitions contributed 1% growth primarily from U.S. packaged gases distributors. On-site volumes were modestly weaker year-over-year and sequentially primarily due to customer turnarounds. Merchant volume trends remain positive year-over-year in the United States and Canada. Liquid nitrogen sales in Mexico for our oil well services business remained significantly weaker year-over-year, but steady sequentially.
Packaged gases grew modestly in North America during the fourth quarter in U.S., Mexico and Canada. Organic sales for our U.S. packaged gas business grew 1% year-over-year and were steady sequentially ex-days. In addition acquisitions contributed 4% growth year-over-year. U.S. growth was driven by gases and rent partially offset by modest declines in hard goods primarily due to the timing of large automation equipment sales in the prior year quarter. U.S. packaged gas growth was broad-based and strongest by end-market to customers in metal fabrication, transportation and construction. Sales to healthcare services, machinery and education such as welding schools also continue to grow.
North American operating profit was $388 million, 2% above the prior year quarter excluding negative foreign currency translations. Growth came from higher volumes, higher pricing and acquisitions. Segment operating margin was 24.4%. Pricing trends remain positive. During mid-December we announced the North American merchant and packaged gas price action effective January 1, 2015 for several products and fees. Proposal activity for new industrial gas on-site plants in North America remains active for chemical customers located primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, as well as smaller on-site plants for manufacturing.
Now please turn to Page 7 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $356 million, 12% below the prior year quarter. Ex-currency cost pass-through and net divestitures organic sales were 1% below the prior year primarily due to weaker sales in Northern Europe. Sequentially organic sales in Spain and Italy including price remained positive while Northern Europe is weaker. Operating profit of $63 million was 9% below the prior year excluding currency, primarily driven by severance cost and lower volumes. Excluding severance cost incurred the operating margin percentage for Europe in the fourth quarter would have been in line with the prior quarters both year-over-year and sequentially.
During the quarter we signed long-term contracts to supply chemical and metals customers in Northern Europe, one in Germany and one in Antwerp via extensions of our existing pipeline networks. Product supply is expected to start in 2016. During 2015 assuming at least stable to modest volume growth including new plant start-up contribution in Russia, we expect to continue to see at least a high-teens operating margin percentage that reflects solid operating leverage with continued focus on fixed cost.
Page 8 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $473 million 8% above the prior year quarter ex-currency. Strong price of 4% year-over-year included recovery of high inflation in the region. South American volume growth of 4% year-over-year was about one-half from Brazil and one-half from the countries outside of Brazil. Praxair Brazil again outperformed the estimated negative 5% industrial production in the quarter, driven by growth in less cyclical end-markets such as healthcare and food and beverage. Sequentially lower volumes in on-site and packaged gas have reduced sales by 1%. During the fourth quarter as expected, customers in Brazil extended holiday shutdown periods. This occurred in most end-markets with the largest impact in manufacturing.
Operating profit in South America was $105 million up 2% over prior year ex-currency, due primarily to higher volumes and pricing. 2015 consensus industrial production for Brazil is estimated to be less than 1%. However, through continued strength of our local business team and management of what is under our control including price and productivity we expect local currency results to continue to outperform. And when economic recovery returns, weâre well positioned for higher growth at strong incremental margins.
Please turn to Slide 9 for our results in Asia. Sales of $407 million grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 5% was driven by new projects start-ups in India and Korea and included sale of equipment of our joint venture in China. Higher price contributed 1% sales growth and was primarily driven by helium. China had only modest base business growth during the quarter, attributable to slowing macro conditions and our continued ongoing efforts to ship merchant liquid from distributor channels to direct customers. Our efforts are supported by our application technologies that are driving growth to end-users in the areas of combustion, metal fabrication and water.
Asiaâs operating profit of $77 million decreased 3% from the prior year excluding currency. Operating profit grew from higher volumes, pricing and productivity gains, but was more than offset by severance cost and a prior year quarter gain of about $10 million related to a land sale in Korea. Proposal activity in Asia continues to be driven by longer-term secular needs in China and India to metals, energy and wastewater treatment end-markets.
However weâre experiencing longer cycle times with customers to bring project to close. For 2015 we expect mid to high single-digit organic growth in Asia including project start-ups of new plants in China and India serving chemicals, metals and manufacturing customers. We expect to continue to protect the margins through strong cost control and productivity as well as through price attainment in India, Korea and Thailand.
Our results for surface technologies are shown on Page 10. Surface technology sales for the quarter were $165 million up 1% compared to the prior year. The underlying sales growth came primarily from higher price. Overall volumes were comparable to the prior year period and looking forward aviation-related coatings remained solid. Operating profit was $30 million as compared to $27 million in the prior year with growth attributable to higher price and productivity initiatives.
And now Iâll turn the call back to Matt, whoâll discuss our outlook and earnings guidance for 2015.
Matt White
Please turn to Page 11. Weâre issuing full year EPS guidance of $6.15 to $6.50 for 2015. Excluding currency this guidance represents 4% to 7% sales growth and 5% to 11% earnings per share growth. Included in these figures is approximately $0.05 or an incremental 1% headwind from higher pension expense versus 2014. This guidance assumes that foreign currency translation will negatively impact our full year sales by 6% and earnings by 7% or $0.44 of EPS. This is one of the largest currency moves weâve seen since the financial crisis.
You can see on Page 15 in the appendix, how each key currency has changed since the last quarter and since the start of 2014. Almost 40% of our sales have experienced 8% to 12% devaluation in foreign currencies which will create an immediate negative impact to our book earnings. However, our contract structure and investment management process have worked to protect us from these fluctuations over the longer-term.
Page 12, shows our year-over-year impact of foreign currencies for the last 16 years, and compares it to the growth of our earnings per share and operating cash flow. You can see that currencies go up and they go down, theyâre unpredictable. However, we continue to grow operating cash flow and our earnings despite this volatility. In fact operating cash flow has increased more than four times over this period.
Weâve been able to achieve this through strong contracts, prudent investment management and ability to increase prices with inflation. Eventually, foreign currencies will rebound and become a tailwind to current book earnings, but no matter what, we will continue to focus on long-term value creation. Excluding currency translation impact, we expect to grow full year organic sales 4% to 7%, which includes volume and price.
Page 16 in the appendix provides a summary chart of our organic growth compared to a sales weighted industrial production. You can see that while IP has been in low single-digits for three years now. We have consistently grown in excess of that number. At this point we are anticipating that 2015 will be similar to the last two years. The 5% to 11% full year EPS growth assumption excluding foreign exchange is based on our proven track-record of improving operating leverage down the income statement. We expect to be able to retain price improvements and draw upon our strong productivity culture to offset the impacts of cost inflation. Furthermore, resilient free cash flow will enable us to continue to reduce our share count, which will improve earnings per share leverage.
Turning to the first quarter, our outlook is for earnings per share in the range of a $1.39 to a $1.47. Consistent with the full year outlook, the first quarter has a significant impact from foreign currency. Excluding a 7% currency headwind, this range results in a year-over-year growth rate of negative 1% to positive 4%, the bottom-end of this range represent some of the year-over-year challenges we are facing in lapping more difficult comps in Latin America. But we are actively working to improve upon this number.
In summary, we are projecting underlying trends in 2015 to be similar to 2014, but currency to be more of a headwind. Despite this we will manage the things we can control, prudently grow and improve the quality of our business. We see solid project growth opportunities in U.S. Gulf Coast and we expect to close on a major project in the next few months. And while uncertainties around emerging markets and commodity prices may delay our customersâ investment decisions, we will deploy our strong cash flow and distribute more capital to shareholders while remaining well positioned for growth opportunities.
And with that, Iâd like to now turn the call over to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrew with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Vincent Andrew
A quick one on pricing, obviously you are seeing it everywhere but Europe year-over-year and I guess you saw it sequentially. But as we sort of enter what otherwise might be perceived as a deflationary environment, given everything that's going on with oil, does that have any impact at all on sort of the pricing opportunity you see over the next 12 or 18 months? Is it actually just a function of the underlying utilization rates or what is sort of the give and take with those dynamics?
Matt White
Well, I think Vincent and first to your point weâre seeing positive pricing around the world and I think just the quarterly euro year-over-year impact in that segment is just more related to some power surcharges that are part of the merchant business. So as power goes down, the surcharges may track down a little bit. But while we are seeing clearly oil prices drop, you're seeing higher inflation in some of the emerging market, so that still will support our strong pricing and I donât expect to see an overly negative pricing impact clearly surcharges that are power-related may go up and down as with diesel surcharges. But the underlying pricing power, we still expect to see in the 1% or 2% that weâve laid out for the year.
Vincent Andrew
Okay. And then if I could just follow-up on China, I think your slide referenced that you are still seeing modest growth there. How has that environment changed sort of for the lower oil scenario? Are you seeing some facilities that now have better input costs running harder? Are you seeing any change in sort of the outlook for the coal olefins projects and so forth? Maybe just help us understand what's going on there.
Matt White
Well, I think prior to the decline in oil, weâve been seeing a general slowing in China especially around some of the large coal-based projects already. I donât think the lower oil will help that situation especially some of the coal to chemical projects remains to be seen which ones will go forward. But I still think in China that the bigger underlying issue is in their effort around environmental improvements, corruption crackdown and just some of the oversupply frankly in certain industry, I think that is just slowing some of the infrastructure investments. So, I donât think the lower oil will help, but we havenât seen any specific projects being either delayed or cancelled because of lower oil in China at this point.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of James Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed.
James Sheehan
In terms of China, could you tell us what was the growth rate in volumes excluding your JV and the sale of equipment there?
Matt White
Yes, so I think that JV impact in the quarter was 1% and 2%, so that's what you would back out there to sort of get to the underlying excluding that sale of equipment probably closer to 2%.
James Sheehan
Okay. And could you also provide some more color on merchant utilization rates by region and what your outlook is for those?
Matt White
Sure. And just to clarify this will be to your point around the merchant side and not the on-site. In North America we're still around the low-80s, now argon is quite tight that's in excess of mid-90s right now, so that is the product that obviously if you can make it then you can sell right now. But we're seeing to Kelcey's comments earlier mid single-digit growth in the merchant business in North America, so I think that situation is pretty good we will probably see the utilization maybe pickup a little bit but right now we're operating in the low-80s.
And South America is mid-80s, so despite the recessionary conditions we're seeing in Brazil a lot of the merchant business in South America goes to a lot of the counter cyclical industries, so food, beverage, healthcare so we're still seeing strong volumes there. The on-site unrelated to this utilization is softer especially in the steel end and we have probably 4 to 5 steel customers that are below take or pay in Brazil today.
Europe mid probably more lower-70s right now. As Kelcey mentioned Northern Europe is starting softened especially Scandinavia more oil-based economy you will see that negative impact and we did see some slowing in the back-end towards December and I think part of that is the impact of oil in Northern Europe.
And in Asia we're mid to high-70s it's a little different in each country. India is probably lower-70s because we have brought on some new capacity recently as we're starting to ramp that up. China maybe high-70s and Korea is a little bit better low-80s we're still seeing some strength in especially electronics markets there. So that's kind of what we're seeing around the world but we definitely have capacity to expand without needing to put much more capital in the ground if we do see it.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Laurence Alexander
Could you talk a little bit about how the volatility in FX flows through to your CapEx? What degree of your CapEx budget is dollar denominated, or if the flat CapEx for the year actually reflects an increase in the number of projects you are planning on bringing on?
Matt White
Sure, so as Kelcey had mentioned a good portion of our CapEx has been in U.S. and Asia. And when you look at some of the Asian currencies like the RMB and even at least as of the six months ago the rupee they haven't devalued that significantly. But generally what you see for CapEx is the construction costs will be in the local currency and the equipment cost could be sourced could be RMB, could be euros, could be dollars it depends on things like heat exchangers, rotating equipment, where you are sourcing that from. So clearly any euro-based equipment will be lower from a U.S. dollar perceptive, but U.S. dollar and RMB equipment won't be that different but construction cost in their local jurisdictions will move right with the currency rates. So looking forward into '15 we have called about a $1.7 billion rough estimate on CapEx here. Anything that's U.S.-based and U.S. Gulf-based will be dollars but some of the other regions we should see some improvement there if these devaluations happen specifically on the construction end.
Laurence Alexander
And then can you give a little bit more detail on sort of the dynamics in Latin America? In the past when you had severe FX volatility you were able to raise price to offset. Can you just walk through what you are seeing now and what you are also seeing in terms of labor inflation, cost inflation, how that affects Latin America over the next couple of years?
Matt White
We did get some pretty good pricing here this last quarter I think about 4% in South America. So we're working to keep up with that inflation. And remember that 4% just represents the merchant and packaged portion but it's divided by the entire sales. So the real pricing actions are higher than that. But I will speak to mainly Brazil right now given it's the majority of our segment, but inflation is a concern I think subsidies will probably be rolled off here which will be healthy for the long-term but it will likely create some inflation pressure in the near-term. I think the Brazilian Central Bank is realizing this hence why they have raised the SELIC rate here again, I think it's north of 12% now. So it will be something that we're used to do down there but we do expect to see especially in the next six to nine months some inflation impact. But we do have pricing mechanisms to recover that most if not all of our contracts in there are inflation indexed and so we should be able to recover that.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.
Duffy Fischer
A question around oil and gas and its impact in the U.S. in particular around CapEx, so you guys build pretty continually, one, what are you seeing with CapEx costs is there a chance that theyâll come down? And then the big build out on the chemical front that we were expecting that you would supply some gases into, does that look like that will either be slowed or delayed somewhat with these slower energy prices?
Matt White
So I can just give you my opinion, itâs hard to really gauge. But most of the projects weâre seeing in the U.S. Gulf Coast are more downstream. So they are petrochemicals, there are a few refinery project interests there. So each customer will be different in how they analyze it, but this first wave which is the ethylene crackers, I havenât read or seen or heard any delays on that front. Weâre not really directly involved in that, itâs not much of a industrial gas consumer. The second wave of some of the petrochemical, while there could be delays, but we havenât seen or heard any yet as youâd probably know Duffy, I mean the big reason for the investment or at least a big portion of it was chasing the lower cost feedstock, and that still exists. So while the spreads may potentially have been impacted here based on the low cost feedstock and what it could potentially ultimately sell the product for, I think itâs still in an attractive spread that theyâre able to achieve even at the new numbers.
And the capital has been the big headwind to your point. So people would look at the profit that they could make and they look at the escalating capital and thatâs been a challenge. While we havenât heard anything of it coming down, I would expect it eventually probably would, youâre going to see potentially more skilled labor be freed up as there is less in the oil patch upstream. I think youâll see less of a pull on significant equipment manufacturers. So hopefully that will free up space and it will free up skilled labor which could at least put a bit of a damping effect on some of the escalating CapEx cost. But we havenât heard it or seen it yet, but it could happen.
Duffy Fischer
And then just one follow-up on U.S., what do you think LOX/LIN capacity increases will be for the industry in North America this year?
Matt White
Itâs hard for me to gauge to our competitorsâ side but I can tell you weâre growing mid single-digit in there. So that should cause us to get a little bit of an uptick, maybe a percent or two in some of our utilizations. Argon there is not much more room to improve that utilization really what you look for is more argon recovery projects and more ability to extract argon. So I think itâs definitely possible you could see an uptick. Now the down side in North America is if you do see a large correction in upstream liquid thatâs going into fracturing or enhanced oil recovery that could impact that utilization rate. Now those molecules maybe redeployed but it would cause the utilizations to go down a bit. So I think there are factors going both ways here, so I donât expect a huge move in utilization but that is something we will continue to monitor.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.
P.J. Juvekar
Your FX chart is quite useful the long-term question is with weaker currencies in many of these countries. How long do you think it takes to see export related growth from those countries? And do you think that will happen?
Matt White
Yes thatâs a good point P.J. weâve been looking into that at some point youâre going to see foreign currencies start to benefit these emerging markets. Their products will become cheaper. I think my guess at this point is the immediate benefit youâll see could be countries like India that are net importers of oil. This will benefit them soon. Longer range it should help the exporting capabilities of some of the other countries. It should make them more competitive now that will probably be at the expense of some U.S. experts today. So weâll have to see how long that takes but weâre well positioned in these emerging markets to capture that if they do become stronger exporters.
P.J. Juvekar
I think you have said in the past that your incremental margins are north of 30% as your loadings improve. And so weâve seen some loadings improve in North America but we havenât seen really a huge operating leverage impact on your operating income line for the last few quarters. So can you tell us whatâs holding that back?
Matt White
A few things, I think first if you look throughout the year weâve had the start-up of some pretty large hydrogen projects. Also through '14 we had natural gas rising, now itâs dropped here in the last couple of months but when you talk over the whole year we had higher pass-through in natural gas which is going to erode margins and then we brought on a lot of hydrogen volume which on an operating margin basis it is lower as you know because it has a large pass through component but on a IRR basis itâs within our normal expectation for cash returns. So thatâs been driving some of the challenge.
In the fourth quarter specifically we do have a certain amount of severance that is baked into this number part of the $15 million North America does have a component in it. And then another angle is Mexico, right, we had some very strong margin business in the upstream with Mexico that really fell off here around end of second quarter beginning of third quarter in '14 and has created some margin pressure in North America. Now as Kelcey mentioned it stabilized here from third quarter to fourth quarter, we do have a new budget in Pemex for 2015. And so weâve seen a little bit of improvement there, but weâll have to continue to monitor it.

The next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.
John Roberts
You've got a project starting up in Russia I think this year and then another one next year. How are those do you think are going to play out?
Matt White
Yes, the large one for Russia is our Evraz it's two large plants. One is running, the other one is coming on here shortly. So it's producing product and that should be fully running here in the next few months for both plants. The other one is a smaller one and thatâs on-track, no concerns at this point. So despite what you read about in Russia and while you are seeing stagflation, we still are able to sell product and weâre still seeing demand locally.
John Roberts
And do you think the backlog at the end of 2015 will be the same, lower, or higher than at the start here of 2015?
Matt White
Itâs hard to say, we have projects rolling off throughout '15 as expected, the U.S. Gulf Coast project when thatâs executed it could be a large number that could cause a jump in it. So right now I would still view it as the number it's at today plus or minus a couple of 100 million, there will be some puts and takes, but I donât see it rising dramatically and I donât know if it fall too rapidly given what weâre seeing in the Gulf Coast opportunity.

The next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Ryan Berney
This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. Just it looks, based on your guidance, that you are guiding to flat sales at the midpoint in '15 and you've called out some repurchases to kind of help you get a little bit of EPS growth, ex the FX hit. But can you give us a little bit of a sense on what you are thinking about as far as acquisitions and if you would consider using that to accelerate the top-line next year?
Matt White
Well, we do have an assumption about 1% and our strategy has been to look at core sort of tuck-in businesses, where we can justify the acquisitions primarily on synergies rather than potential sales growth. So, weâll continue to scour the globe for those opportunities given the very strong dollar foreign acquisitions are more attractive, but they still need to be in our wheelhouse and they still need to bring the synergies and opportunities that we would expect. So, I am not seeing anything much more than the 1%, but weâll continue to look and run them through our models.
Ryan Berney
And then from -- on the EPS guidance perspective, are you using FX rates as of the end of the year or are you using those more today? What are you forecasting there?
Matt White
Generally how we do our outlook rates is, weâll take the one-year forward curve and weâll take the average over that one-year forward curve. But if you were to even look at the spot numbers that can be a rough proxy but the more technical version we use is that average rate in the one-year forward curve.

The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Kevin McCarthy
Would you discuss the economics of adding additional argon capacity, presumably with North American rates in the mid-90s and price increases that may become more attractive? And if so, how does it differ through recovery projects or retrofits versus perhaps adding additional ASUs?
Matt White
The economics tend to be fairly strong part of a reason is argon is tight, but part of the reason also is you're making whatâs call premium argon and what premium argon is, is you basically vent the oxygen to make argon. So most of the projects that weâre able to do are cost savings projects itâs a more efficient power use to make that argon and it could be a combination of recovering argon in your fills zones, when you fill trucks or it could be actually inside the cold box either gathering or refining extra argon molecules. So, weâll look across the whole spectrum of our production plans and weâre scouring all over North America trying to find argon opportunities to both enhance cost reduction as well as meet the demand. So, they tend to be highly creative projects.
Kevin McCarthy
And as a second question, are you completely agnostic to diesel prices due to pass-throughs? Or is there perhaps any small portion that's not pass through or kind of lower floor limits on surcharges where if Brent continued to go lower you would perhaps brake through the floor and capture margin, anything along those lines?
Matt White
Yes actually it's a little bit of all of that, Kevin. We do have some floors so if it goes below that floor that would be value weâd keep. We do have lags on our diesel surcharges, so we should positively benefit on that lag. And as you could imagine we're always trying to manage underlying overall price and then you have surcharge as well, so really need to step back and look at the entire equation to understand surcharges versus pricing. But for the most part we're covered but we continue to try to identify areas in that equation.

The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Jeff Zekauskas
How much did your energy business or your energy end-market grow in North America in the quarter?
Matt White
The energy market in North America for just the quarter, year-over-year or sequential?
Jeff Zekauskas
The quarter, year-over-year.
Matt White
Yes it was down, we're down 1% on the global and the majority of that's driven by North America. So you could back into what that relates to on a segment basis. But that's really some of the upstream projects that have slowed a bit. But on some of the other areas in North America we haven't seen a negative impact yet. So Mexico as we've mentioned was already at a low rate, so we already have seen that stable sequentially and with the new budget even a little bit of an uptick. Canada right now we have not seen a significant slowdown but the expectation is when they go into the fall or the breakup here in a couple of months that they will probably come out much lighter, still remains to be seen but that's what we expect could happen. And on U.S. side we haven't seen a material slowdown, some of the upstreams that we've been providing are pretty low cost, they are pretty efficient wells. Where we've really seen the biggest impact to-date other than currencies has been our offshore dominion those tend to be the higher costs, incremental oil extraction. So those are the ones whether it be North Sea or some of the other locations in Asia that they serve that's where we've seen the biggest slowdown to-date.
Jeff Zekauskas
Is it fair to say that through the first nine months, on average, your energy revenues in North America grew in excess of 20%?
Matt White
Well we did have some assets that came on stream that are downstream, so they would have driven some of that growth.
Jeff Zekauskas
And that has driven some of that growth.
Matt White
Yes that's in the refining space, right. And as you know when you look at our energy segment two-thirds of it is downstream.
Jeff Zekauskas
Yes. But still, is it fair to say that you were in -- I guess in some quarters in the high 20s, maybe some quarters in the mid-teens and now the outlook for that is more flattish going forward?
Matt White
Yes but a big part of that is your lapping those large downstream projects that came on.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Manthey with R.W. Baird. Please proceed.
David Manthey
Matt, could you tell us how the $15 million in headcount reductions were spread geographically?
MattWhite
We don't -- that exact number we didn't have public but I can tell you that it's spread in Europe, Asia and North America primarily. And I would say probably close to half of itâs North America and you could probably split the rest.
David Manthey
Okay. And then philosophically, your future assumptions for sort of the market growth, industrialization of emerging markets, and the global energy investment, as you look out over the next three to five years are your expectations lower, higher, the same as they were, say, three or five years ago?
Matt White
Just in energy in general or specifically on the Gulf Coast?
David Manthey
No, I'm thinking mainly just of the two areas, energy, yes, and then also the industrialization of emerging markets more broadly.
Matt White
So in energy I think anything that was upstream is going to be we looked at especially if it was something that was relying on a spread. And we kind of expected that I think as you may recall when we looked at gas to liquid projects we were sort of questioning their viability in the beginning, so I think projects like that will probably get a much deeper look. Downstream energy projects at this point I don't see any major impact. Now there was in the U.S. I believe a potential hydrocracker project that was postponed, so that could happen and that may happen. So I think the uncertainty will may be pause some investment decisions but if you are just making transportation fuels today I think holding all as constant you are probably seeing a little bit better spread right now, so those investments should probably still happen.
And on the plastics chain which I guess gets more into the chemical side frankly, as I mentioned earlier we havenât seen any significant change there yet. As far as the industrialization the emerging markets have had a challenge here for a couple of years now. So this is not in my opinion much different than what weâve seen over the last 18 to 24 months in the emerging markets. So weâve been seeing Chinaâs deceleration growth over the last six to nine months, weâve seen Brazil in and out of recessions for the last two years. So I think this is kind of consistent with what weâve seen and what weâve expected. But to P.J.âs earlier call if currencies get to a point it could make their products more competitive and that might hopefully become a tailwind for some of the emerging markets, especially the more commodity driven ones as their currency makes them more competitive.

The next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Curt Siegmeyer
This is Curt Siegmeyer in for Mike. Just a couple of questions on the potential for share repurchases in 2015. You guys saw pretty nice jump close to 800 million in share buybacks in '14 would you expect it to remain at similar levels this year or maybe taper back off to closer to what it was in 2012 and '13?
Matt White
Yes I think Curt probably the easiest way to look at it in my mind is start with our operating cash flow. So $3 billion plus or minus and hopefully we can improve that more this year but start with that number. Weâre going to pay our dividends, so thatâs about 800 million or so, so that will leave you about 2.2 billion-2.1 billion left. And that is going to be deployed between our CapEx and our buybacks. So weâre not looking to really lever up or pay down debt too much for that matter. So I am looking to keep net debt on a dollar basis relatively stable. So the amount of buybacks will be a function of where our CapEx ultimately ends. Right now weâre calling 1.7 but if things change that number could be altered.
Curt Siegmeyer
And then just one on the project backlog, the 1.9 billion, could you just remind us roughly what percent of that is tied either directly or indirectly to energy and then what the composition sort of is of the rest?
Matt White
The energy is about a third, and manufacturing is probably a quarter, you got chemicals as about a fifth, probably 15% metals and the rest is kind of electronics and some other industries. But energy is the third and of that energy theyâre all downstream. Two of them are refining projects, one being Chevron which is delayed due to a customerâs situation on permitting and the other one being Northwest which is really a fully integrated from bitumen to refined transportation fluids. So it takes the whole distribution from upstream to downstream. So those are the main projects in the energy bucket.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
David Begleiter
Matt, can we -- you may have mentioned this, what is the EPS impact from new plant start-ups in 2015? And what was in 2014?
Matt White
So weâll start with 2015, I think David as you may recall when we had laid out couple of years ago we talked about 3% and 4% sales growth on new projects and 2% to 3% sort of base underlying organic growth. And they were two important components to hit the high single-digit sales growth. And right now when you look at our '15 projection the two combined weâre seeing 3% to 5%. So instead of those two numbers which weâre bringing more in a 5 to 7 were now 3 to 5. So weâre a couple percent short on that range. And I would argue itâs really split almost between both the base and the projects.
The challenge in the base is, is frankly what weâre seeing around the world, I think Brazil is negative IP, Europe is almost zero, China is decelerating. So those have taken that 2% to 3% organic down to probably 1% to 2%. On projects that 3 to 4 is probably or more like 2 to 3 at least now, and part of it is we just havenât been replenishing the backlog as fast as we need it to achieve the 3 to 4. So thatâs sort of how '15 was put together. In '14 itâs not that much different. In the fourth quarter here we were probably roughly half from project contribution, half from base. And weâre starting to lap some of the bigger hydrogen projects that brought some growth. So thatâs sort of how weâre seeing this on a go forward basis and how we finished the year in terms of that contribution.
David Begleiter
And then just on U.S. packaged gas volumes, should they accelerate do you think in '15 versus '14? Are you up more than 2% you had in '14?
Matt White
We definitely expect growth. I think when you look at the numbers combined in '14 we saw very strong gas rent growth. Hard goods which is spotty was up and down but there were some negative low single-digit hard good numbers for this fourth quarter and a lot of that is driven by timing of very lumpy automation equipment. And Kelcey had mentioned that in the prepared remarks. So, we saw a lot of strong automation equipment in the early and mid-part of this year, I should say of 2014 and I think that was related to some of the difficulty of getting skilled labor, getting skilled welders and they went to an automation solution to help meet those needs. So those we lapped and that will put some strain on the automation equipment in hard good, but we still expect to see low single-digit growth in gas and I donât see any reason why that should be different in '15. I think we have time for one more question.

The next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed.
Don Carson
Yes, thank you. Just to follow-up on energy, Matt, last call you said if oil got down in the 50s it would have a real impact on your business, but it sounds like you're not really seeing that because it turns out maybe your upstream customers are lower cost than you think. So just wondering if you would comment on that or if that's one of the reasons why you are a little more cautious on the '15 outlook, just thinking that at some point you will see lower demand from your upstream customers?
Matt White
Yes, I think Don itâs part of it I think is just a delay. So, part of our customers are hedged and when those hedges roll off if you're still at these levels they likely will slowdown or lay down rigs. Also you have certain customers that maybe in the middle of they have leased rigs, they have got crews, they want to just complete and finish their programs and get their oil produced and then when that program is done they may breakup the camp and lay down the rig. So it takes time to see this slowdown, I think you look at new rig permits thatâs drop drastically, so the future opportunity is limited, on existing production people are finishing what they have if they are hedged they will go longer. So, I do think this will drop if oil stays at this level, it's just not something you're going to see in one or two months, it may take three or four months. But I do think in the back-half of this year there will be some headwinds on this business. And Mexico which is a little bit different there was as we discussed in prior calls some more governmental components on the budgets thatâs at a pretty low level right now, weâre going to have a very difficult comp in Q1 to lap with Mexico given it was quite strong in the beginning of '14, but that is moving more towards a government policy then really the price of oil at this point.
Don Carson
And then the offsets that you mentioned on weaker currencies in some markets an example would be Canada where you got a slide in the dollar. Would you expect letâs say, Eastern Canadian manufacturing could pick up the slack and then offset the second-half decline in energy? Or is that just too smaller part of your business now?
Matt White
Well weâre definitely seeing some pick up in Quebec and in Ontario in some of the manufacturing areas they are clearly more competitive, they do have a large supply to the U.S., so it's become 20 plus percent more competitive on a price basis. I think the question will be whatâs the long range outlook for people to make investments into Eastern Canada? But at least the immediate effect we are seeing is some pick up in manufacturing activity there just given the differential in the Canadian dollar.
