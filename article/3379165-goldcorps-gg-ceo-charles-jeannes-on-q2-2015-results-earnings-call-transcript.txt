Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Goldcorp Inc. Q2 2015 Results Conference Call for Thursday, July 30, 2015. Please be advised that this call is being recorded.
I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jeff Wilhoit, Vice President, Investor Relations of Goldcorp. Please go ahead, Mr. Wilhoit.
Jeff Wilhoit
Thank you, Donna, and welcome to the Goldcorp second quarter earnings conference call. Among the Senior Managements in the room with me today are Chuck Jeannes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lindsay Hall, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; George Burns, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Russell Ball, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Project.
For those of you participating on the webcast, we have included a number of slides to support this afternoonâs discussion. These slides are available on our website at www.goldcorp.com.
As a reminder, we will be discussing forward-looking information that involves unique risks concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Goldcorp. Forward-looking statements include, that are not limited to, statements with respect to future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, and costs and timing of the development of new deposits.
Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes.
Chuck Jeannes
Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, everyone, for joining us. Before I move to our quarterly results I need to report that we received news late last night of the tragic vehicle accident in the town of [Mashpee] and Zacatecas, Mexico. That resulted in numerous fatalities and many more serious. We understand that some of the affected include one of our employees and several family members of our nearby PeÃ±asquito mine.
And some of you online in the town of Mashpee during a previous Goldcorp investor tour itâs about 15 kilometer from PeÃ±asquito and all of Goldcorp are grieving this morning for the victims of this tragedy and for the friends and family members that are today dealing with such a terrible loss. All emergency response teams of PeÃ±asquito were on site to provide assistance immediately after the accident and were making available every resource at our disposal to aid the victims and their family.
So were coming to you today from QuÃ©bec City were we just concluded our quarterly board meetings. This afternoon will be heading up to L.A. in order to celebrate his inauguration and checking on its accelerating ramp up. I am turning right to our second quarter performance we were very pleased to report strong operating and financial results.
Gold production was record 908,000 ounces with all and sustaining costs continuing to trend downward at $846 ounce adjusted operating cash flow was 358 million or $0.43 a share. Very importantly Iâd highlight that we have now turn the corner from investment to harvest move as we deliver free cash flow of 174 million for the quarter or 50 million after the payment.
All in there was an outstanding quarter such suffers successful year. George walk through the excellent operating results were record production from the heart of the ore body at PeÃ±asquito plus strong performance at Cerro Negro more than offset the slower ramp at ÃlÃ©onore. Beyond on the operations our second quarter was also notable for a number of successfully executed initiatives as part of our strategy to remain well-positioned for success in any gold price environment.
We substantially enhanced the company's liquidity through a $1 billion increase in our credit facility up to 3 billion and a very attractive term. We had to our long-term track record of creating value through the investment of non-core assets with the sale of our interest to Cerro Negro project and then through the sale of our 26% statements all resources.
Another key element of our strategy was rightsizing our dividend its more appropriately allocate free cash flow in light of weaker metals prices. As we report this morning we reduced the dividend per share by 60% to $0.02 per month. Absent this change at current metal prices we would be paying an inordinate amount of our free cash flow to fund our dividend. So the board has taken this step to ensure that we preserve the flexibility to fund our many organic growth opportunity.
Turning to the guidance we provided this morning. With the overall portfolio performing very well we expect to trend towards the upper end of our gold production guidance of between 3.3 million and 3.6 million ounces per ton. As a part of that updated outlook in light of PeÃ±asquito strong quarter and outlook for the second half we expect production there to be towards the upper end of the 2015 guidance.
And then conversely at ÃlÃ©onore the slower ramp-up is expected to result in 2015 production at or below the low end of guidance. On the cost side continued focus on cost reduction along with favorable currency effects in our Canadian and Mexican operations help drive our all in sustaining costs downward for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Our operating for excellence program continues to deliver wins in the form of productivity and efficiency enhancements and we remain on track toward our goal of a $175 million in additional realize benefits. Consequently we've improved our all in sustaining costs guidance to between $850 and $900 per ounce.
Weâre working on cost containment throughout the organization including our corporate offices and our corporate G&A guidance has also been reduced to approximately $170 million compared to our prior guidance of a $185 million. With our capital investments tracking as planned, we've also reconfirmed capital spending of between $1.2 billion and $1 billion.
As I mentioned earlier our job and our strategy is to manage the company to thrive regardless of what price environment we find ourselves in. Our focus continues to be on what we can control, our costs, and net of time of flat or declining metals price that's the way we must protect our margins.
So we ended this cycle in a pretty strong position, our balance sheet is in excellent shape providing us great liquidity and financial flexibility. Our costs are declining allowing for that margin protection I just mentioned. We see a particular benefit from having so many of our operations in Canada and Mexico where the FX movements are partially offsetting the gold price reduction.
And as you can see on the slide, we have a clear plan as to how weâll manage our business if we see even lower metals prices. Weâve already taken some of the steps, weâre prepared to take further action if necessary. The bottom line is that weâre confident we can successfully whether any conceivable goal price environment.
So turning to the gold market itself youâve certainly seen the concerns over Chinese capital markets and slowing growth rates combined with the strong U.S. dollar that had a negative effect on the gold price. But I continue to believe that the long-term trends in support of gold remain intact.
Central banks continue to remain in net buyers and long-term fundamentals pointed growth in the Chinese and Indian principal markets. Recall this in just the first quarter of this year Chinese consumer demand was the fourth largest on record. On the supply side we see lower mine supplies of gold next year and continuing in definitely and I think as this new reality begins to take hold there must be a market response.
Our focus will remain on those things we can control as I said execution of our growing low-cost gold production profile the growth of gold reserves that will drive strong financial returns over time with a stable portfolio of high-quality long-lived assets and strong investment-grade balance sheet weâre well-positioned for success in the current gold price environment.
And so with that I'm going to turn it over to George.
George Burns
Thanks Chuck. I am very pleased to report Goldcorpâs mines delivered safe second quarter gold production of 908,000 ounces at low all in sustaining cost of $846 per ounce. Record gold production was driven by PeÃ±asquito and Cerro Negro as well as solid performance at most of the mines.
At PeÃ±asquito an extremely strong second quarter was driven by higher sulphide grades as a result of positive model reconciliation as substantial mining took place in the heart of the deposit in Phase 5C. With continued focus on operating for excellence, we delivered another quarter of declining cost.
Musselwhite in particular deserves special mention for success of bring down their cost. Musselwhite had been among our highest cost mines. And the [indiscernible] General Manager and his team amongst the lowest in the portfolio this quarter at $761 per ounce is an outstanding accomplishment.
I believe we have the right people in place to continue to unlock efficiency and productivity improvements across all of our mines. PeÃ±asquito gold production was a record 298,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $416 per ounce. Particularly higher grades in the second quarter expected to moderate later in the year and we are maintaining our production guidance albeit toward the high-end of between 700,000 and 750,000 ounces.
Construction of the Northern Well Field is on hold until a fair resolution of so and so issues with our local community can be reached. We are confident, we can achieve a resolution in the near-term. However, we have mitigation strategies in place which include additional 50 watering that will give us adequate freshwater. The Metallurgical Enhancement Project feasibility study for PeÃ±asquito remains on track for completion in early 2016 with permit applications submitted in May.
During the quarter, the pilot plant construction was completed and we commence testing with positive results. At Camino Rojo, we continue to advance the pre-feasibility study which is on track to be completed in 2016. An update of the geologic model continued during the quarter and metallurgical testing of the sulfide transition and oxide zones also progress with positive results. With the successful ramp-up at Cerro Negro are well underway second quarter safe gold production totaled 131,300 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $792 per ounce.
Increased production resulted from plant ramp-up of the higher grade Marianna Central mine and an increase in haulage capacity that we achieved following the arrival of additional surface oil trucks. The mill continued to perform well during the second quarter. Throughput averaged about 3300 tons per day. Hopefully, efforts continue to be a great success story at Cerro Negro as gold and silver recoveries improved further as a result of optimizing grind size and reagents. At the drill bit, we continued our resource definition drilling program expanding resources with strong results at the Mariannaâs complex, Bajo Negro and Vein Zone.
Turning to Eleonore, safe quarter gold production was below expectations totaling 43,800 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1656 per ounce. As we work through the startup issues, we saw improving performance towards the end of the quarter and continuing into July. Mining of ore continue to take place in the first two main production horizons and we expect to commence production from the next two production horizons this quarter. These additional horizons set us up for strong second half with improved flexibility and higher, ore grade.
Long whole stopes in horizon 4 have been drilled and development is progressing which supports substantially higher grades as expected. Following the shutdown in May, no throughput Eleonoreâs averaged about 5100 tons per day and is performing very well. As a result of our slow start, we expect production at or below the low-end of guidance range for the year. We included in this slide in our investor deck and have updated it with the current location of the decline and production at the end of the second quarter. This outlines for each of the horizons are and you can see the yellow stopes that we expect to mine by year-end on.
On the exploration front two more drills were added in May for a total of four which are focused on infill drilling in the lower portion of the deposits in horizons 5 and 6. Work on the Eleonore crown pre-feasibility study, continue to advance during the second quarter. Major activities included progression of the tradeoff study between pit and underground mining determination of the type location and permitting and stakeholder engagement efforts. The completion of this pre-feasibility study is expected by the end of 2015.
Turning to Red Lake. Safe gold production totaled 90,800 ounces while all in sustaining cost of $879 per ounce. Production was lower than the prior quarter result of lower grades from fewer tons mine in the high grade zone due to the mine sequencing. For the second half of 2015 we expect higher tonnage as we ramp up the upper Red Lake zone are mechanized both mining is being deployed.
At our HG Young discovery exploration continue to advance north from the 14 level of the Campbell Complex. This drip provides a new drill platform for follow-up drilling at several positive intercepts from the ongoing surface exploration program and we are working towards initial and initial resource by year end.
At Cochenour intercepts gold rates remain consistent with expectations however recent drill data and newly discovered mineralized zones indicate a change in orientation of some of the Veins compared to our existing model. Additional advance exploration and analysis is underway and we need to finish that work to provide information to complete the final mine planning and infrastructure. We still plan to process mill feet from the first test soaps by the end of this year.
Before I turn it over to Lindsay I have the same I am very pleased with our second quarter and with laid you are shaping up. We have a strong portfolio of mines with good opportunities ahead of us. Our focus remains on execution. Lindsay.
Lindsay Hall
Thanks George. Our excellent operating performance resulted in $528 million of operating cash flows for the quarter. Fully funding our capital expenditures and dividend payments. So really good quarter financial performance. We renewed our revolving credit facility for another five years through 2020 at the same rates of 17.5 basis points undrawn, LIBOR plus 120 basis points drawn.
With repayments made in the second quarter and the application of Tahoe net proceeds in the third quarter. We expected the revolver balance to be down to zero by the end of the year. That will leave us with was about 2.5 billion of long-term debt with risk schedule repayment in 2018. We were also pleased that SMP restored our stable BBB plus rating which reinforces their view that we have the financial strength to comfortably whether periodic downturns in the commodity cycle, which we find our sales in today.
Turning to the income statement, record gold sales of 903,000 ounces resulted in over 1.3 billion an adjusted revenues for the quarter. All in sustaining cost for the quarter was $846 per ounce compared to $885 per ounce in the prior quarter. The decrease mainly due to higher gold sales volume. While the companyâs operating cost benefit from the foreign exchange effects of the Canadian Mexico operations. The currency hedging program previously placed on 2015 new season effect somewhat.
The company generated $358 million or $0.43 per share of adjusted operating cash flows which is before a positive change in working capital of $202 million. Given that Cerro Negro and ÃlÃ©onore commercial production we treated most of the new capital spent and you can see that we generated a positive $174 million of cash flow showing the financial strength of our portfolio mines.
For the quarter we reported $392 million of net earnings or $0.47 per share compared net loss of $87 million, or $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the impacts of dilution and realized gains in the sale of Tahoe and the unrealized losses from the foreign exchange translation of deferred income tax assets. Adjusted net earnings total $65 million or $0.08 per share in the second quarter, compared to $12 million or $0.01 per share in the previous quarter.
Regarding provisional pricing, we had a positive $6 million impact at PeÃ±asquito and negligible impact at Alumbrera for the second quarter. For the third quarter provisional sales at June 30, 2015 at PeÃ±asquito we had 205,600 ounces of gold price at $1,172 per ounces, 4.7 million of sliver, 15.57 per ounces, 45 million pounds of zinc price at $0.90 per pound, and 33 million pounds of lead priced at $0.80 per pound. While at Alumbrera we have 4,590 ounces of gold priced at $1,170 per ounce and 4.2 million pounds of copper priced at $2.61 per pound.
We've also reported today we have increased our guidance for the rest of the year regarding DD&A per ounce that is depreciation, completion and amortization. We now expected to be approximately $425 per ounce for the year. The cost associated with acquiring and building assets are amortized over the existing reserve base to determine the DDA per ounce.
With these new mines the DDA per ounce will start out high and as exploration success converts more ounces to reserves. The DD&A per ounce will decrease. In closing as Chuck mentioned, we are all cognizant of the challenges brought by lower metal prices. I am very comfortable with our financial position both today and in any conceivable gold price range.
We manage the business for the long-term with our financial strength weâre making those investments that make sense both today and for the future when commodity prices rebound.
With that I'll turn it back to you operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Quail
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much for the update and congratulations on a very, very strong quarter operationally. Few questions. Firstly, on PeÃ±asquito and I was doing the model this morning. Given your guidance, is that 700,000 to 750,000 and we know you guys run a good part of the ore body as you mentioned and the drive was, I think, probably hard and most probably expected. Can you sort of give any color on what you think for sort of Q3, Q4, because it's pretty hard to get to even the top end of the year, the guidance.
George Burns
Sure, Andrew, itâs George.
Andrew Quail
Thanks, George.
George Burns
You know that the grades were extremely high in the second quarter. Weâre expecting the grades in the second half to be down around 0.8 gram per ton and so substantially lower production in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second and more in line with our expectation. So weâre not expecting that positive great reconciliation to continue into the second half right.
Andrew Quail
Great, yes, that makes more sense. On the dividend, all these prudent what you guys have done, cutting and you do a pay, relatively hard this piece. And then we have seen last week or so that go positive have corrected, Chuck, do you think if we do get through this period of time and prices do increase. Is that flexible to sort of increase again and what sort of decisions when you guys have to say and how long would have to see metal prices sort of rebound?
George Burns
Yes, itâs a good question Andrew, because we had a very long-term view in our business we make investments that take three or four years and then build mines in last 20 years. But when it came to this decision at a $1,100 gold it's hard to keep that dividend up where it was, if you assume that price continues for rest of the year, it means if weâre having to borrow money to pay the dividend, which just makes no sense.
So I think that as we do as we've always done the board will look at the dividend on a quarterly basis and weâll take everything into account that we have in front of us including metals prices, our view on the future, our investments that we have coming up. We like putting money back into high returning, high-quality investments and weâve got some nice organic opportunities out there in front of us that weâre continuing to advance. So you take all those things into account when you make a decision and I really can't predict what might happen in the future, weâll just have to see as we go.
Andrew Quail
Okay and last one, just on probably Tahoe. Just got a back of quarter, there's sort of is the same or it's a timing difference of 10,000 and in production and it is that I look back to last few quarters it is, do you thinks this going forward, is that become more consistent look at as historically or do you sort of see that variability being consistent, but being [heatest] day?
George Burns
Yes, Andrew I think it should be normal, there is nothing - I know quarter-over-quarter we had lot less sales at PV than the first quarter just because we had inventory at the end of the 2014 year that we sold in the first quarter. But there is nothing, there shouldnât be really much of a lag quarter-over-quarter.
Andrew Quail
Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Chidley from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Patrick Chidley
All morning afternoon, everybody.
Charles Jeannes
Hello, Patrick.
Patrick Chidley
Just a question on Northern well field halting activities and yet you're confident that in the short-term, you could get a resolution. Those two things don't seem to gel. I mean what's the timing on this and how - what kind of downside is for example it there is no resolution in the next sort of 6 to 12 months?
Charles Jeannes
So Patrick, couple of facts weâre about 88% complete with the construction so there is not a lot of work left, we could wrap the whole thing up in four months. And so when you look at our hydrologic modeling increased 50 watering that's underway, weâve got plenty of flexibility well into next year.
In terms of negotiations, it's like any negotiation we got to get through it, but weâre confident they'll get resolved I think before the end of the year weâll just have to see all those negotiations go. We have that alternatives if this negotiation doesn't go well as we expect so that's what our confidence is there if we've got multiple options here.
Patrick Chidley
Okay. And is it to do with the actual well field area itself, or is it right a back, that's for the pipeline?
Charles Jeannes
Itâs one particular community - itâs the pipeline and I think one of the walls, the bulk of the wells arenât almost particular communityâs property.
Patrick Chidley
I see. Okay. And then on Camino Rojo is saying that there is good progress on the network there. Can you, maybe characterize that bit more, is it very Pensaquito sulphide ore, and also what sort of timing and what sort of negotiations will you have to have been able to treat that as a satellite pit to say if you like for Penasquito. I mean, when do you think that might come into the production stream at Penasquito.
Charles Jeannes
We are on the metallurgical test work so we have an oxide reserve in place and thatâs all basically - the work is focused on the transition and sulphide material. In the transition, weâve got ongoing test work that is going to some positive results on improved recovery essentially building that transition, some of it will go to oxide treatment and some will go to sulphide. We are working pretty hard on that and we have the sulphide mineralization is similar to PeÃ±asquito or plant. Weâll work for that sulphide processing with some modifications.
In terms - put into production if we have that direction, we are looking at transportation routes, we got truck haulage as an option, we are looking at real option so all that would âany of the non-highway options would take community negotiations routing right ways so that work is ongoing. Additionally water is another thing weâre focused on, weâre looking at the PeÃ±asquito expanded water district is as a source and particularly now that weâre looking at processing the material at PeÃ±asquito. So all those activities are underway and weâre feeling pretty good about that opportunity as an optionality on PeÃ±asquito mine life and perhaps expansion.
Patrick Chidley
Okay. About timing on the oxide project presumably, that's going to be done first in any case. So the sooner the better really.
Lindsay Hall
Yes. Patrick, maybe I can just jump in and remind you that we have a pre-feasibility study that will be done in 2016 and then still have to get on with the feasibility and detailed engineering and permitting and the like. So we're advancing it, but I wouldn't put it in your model coming in 2017. It's going to take a bit longer than that.
Patrick Chidley
Thanks very much guys.
Lindsay Hall
You bet.
Operator
Thank you. The next question if from David Haughton from CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton
Hi, Chuck, Lindsay and George. Just sticking with Penasquito. I noticed the recoveries were up in the quarter compared to what we've seen. Is that in relation to the better grades that have gone through or is there some sort of constant tile thing to think about here?
Charles Jeannes
David before I pass on the George just wanted to congratulate you on your new posting is good to have you back on the file and weâll get use to you coming on behalf of CIBC here.
David Haughton
Yet no profiles on the name yet.
George Burns
Yes, regarding the recovery for sure that the substantially higher head grade gave us a good tailwind. Unless we see oxidation in that sulfite feed you can get to constant tail. So is that head grade goes up the recovery goes up with it.
David Haughton
Okay. And should we be sticking with the 110,000 ton per day sort of throughput level given where you've been recently and some sort of thought to the hold up on the water wells?
Charles Jeannes
Yes, and our throughput right now isn't restricted by water. And so, we're going to be in that 110,000, 115,000 ton a day range.
David Haughton
Okay. And now just flicking over to Eleonore, clearly a big catch up in the second half to go anyway new guidance on noticing you do, but I'm somewhat surprised with the right where it's been around for the full 5 gram kind a level and do you have an expectation of stepping up materially free time as well?
Charles Jeannes
Yes we are expecting a substantial jump in grade both third quarter and fourth quarter, nearly when you look at the disappointing second quarter a couple of things impacted us one we are dialing in the right drilling blast scope size and so we had some oversize and that material handling difficultly with oversized slowdown down the mining and we also had some of the stopes with higher than expected dilution.
But what I can tell you late in the second quarter and coming in the third quarter weâre having an improvement in our fragmentation our belief is that weâve dialed in the right drilling blast techniques some of the stopes such the material handling will happen well. The stopes we have wind up in the second half are substantially higher grade and so you are going to see a lot stronger third and fourth quarter.
David Haughton
And also in your remarks earlier, George, I think I heard you say that you have hit from time-to-time 5,000 tons a day, which is ahead of what I would have expected, and I guess the next question is what kind of level, do you feel comfortable with at the moment on a sustained basis?
George Burns
So we are comfortable at the 5000 tons a day range based on what we are currently achieving and we've actually exceeded 6000 tons a day on the single way basis. So we know that plant is edging very close up to design a 7000 ton a day and itâs really getting the underground ramped up its going to deliver the strong second half.
David Haughton
And we're I'm looking at the costs very hard obviously the judge in the first quarter of commercial production. But with the high throughput and better grades then you fixed cost base should be coming down pretty quickly in the second half, is that a fair interpretation?
George Burns
Thatâs correct.
David Haughton
Okay thank you very much everybody.
Charles Jeannes
Good luck, David.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.
John Tumazos
Thank you very much. While we too are very optimistic about the goal outlook, there are forecasters in the market under a $1000 now and we're not that far from it. In the event the prices of gold were $100 or $1,000, are there any business leverage you would core policies should change or would you just continue managing for the long-term because your balance sheet is strong and you've got.
Charles Jeannes
Hi, John. That's certainly a key question. We thought a lot about it. We always try to sensitize our business and make sure we're prepared for a wide range of external scenarios, including metal prices of course. So we put up this Slide number 7. I don't know if you saw it, but over time we've had a strategy. So what are the kinds of things that we would do in a declining price environment to make sure that we kept the company strong.
We've already done some of them. We've reduced our corporate G&A, we reduced our enhanced - certainly enhanced the liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet by selling the Tahoe shares and upsizing the revolver and now reducing the dividend. We have the opportunity in front of us to start deferring capital projects at mines, we havenât done that at this point. We are still going full speed ahead with things like the Hollinger project and the Hoyle Pond deep wins and the near-pit crushing and conveying at PeÃ±asquito and so.
We have opportunities on particular projects like that if we had to we could start slowing down and I don't mean those specifically but just use those as examples and weâre also working to make sure that our G&A out at the regional sites and that the mines is appropriate, we can optimize our production and make sure that weâre focusing only on ounces that make money and sometimes that means that you reduce production.
But the ounces you're making are turning a profit for you and then things really get down below a 1,000 and then stay there for a while you got to start looking at reconfiguring and shutting down pieces of mines or parts of operations to make sure that you're not in an ongoing net cash deficit.
I guess one thing I would say is that weâll be pretty proactive even though we have a strong balance sheet weâre not going to operate in a mode were dollars are going out the door for an extended period. Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Kaip from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaip
Good afternoon, Chuck. I have two questions. One is regarding Red Lake. You indicated on the call that you're revising your interpretation of structures at the [indiscernible] deposit and I'm just wondering in consideration of that, do you have a sense of how long it's going to take geological department to reconcile or resolve what those structural indications are going to be? And then what are the implications from a development standpoint as you move back that as on forward?
George Burns
Itâs George. So the first question over the next quarter or two I am sure weâll have an understanding of what weâre seeing in the development essentially from the drill information we've opened up on some of the cells that will support the initial stokes and weâre seeing some of the veins with a different orientation, so and weâre doing some current development in additional drilling to help the geologists get that well understood. And it's really about ensuring to get infrastructure in the right place.
So to the second part of the question and we got a ramp that we want to ensure is in the right location. And we also want to make sure these cells are properly located. So you know, we still expect to have first stopes up in the fourth quarter and again over the next quarter or two. I am sure weâre going to have this well understood and finalize the mine plan for next year.
Andrew Kaip
All right, thanks very much. And then the second question has to do with the Camino, and deposit in the transitional material. What are the key challenges from metallurgical perspective that you're encountering income. You indicated that there is going to be some worse or quarter might selective mining that's going to take place in reference to oxide and sulphide material, but transitional material can be problematic with recoveries and I'm just wondering where those problems are arising in your studies at this point in time?
George Burns
So I mean in the recent work, itâs more of an opportunity than a problem and essentially in the prior work that transitional material as all deemed to be leach and what we're finding is a fair portion of that transition material is a amenable to pretty good sulphide recoveries and economics. So thatâs where the focus is, how can we improve through our economics Camino Rojo by processing a portion of that transition material through the sulphide process. So we expect that to have some positive impacts as we continue our metallurgical work
Andrew Kaip
Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question is from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Jorge Beristain
Hi guys. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. I have a few questions. Maybe the first one for Chuck, the dividend you in tone that you're really try to balance it towards free cash flow and you do not want to be in a position to borrow to pay the dividend if in 2016 we continue to see a weak gold price. Is that what you're going to manage your dividend policy towards? In other words, you don't want to borrow to pay the dividend.
Charles Jeannes
Yes, like I said there is a lot of factors that go into the boardâs decision each quarter as it looks at the dividend and decides what to do going forward and certainly big part of that is what our models show in terms of our cash generation and how much of that cash is going to pay the dividend versus going into the bank or to pay for the organic opportunities that we have.
So the gold price stays low what we've done today, we think that this makes sense in the spot price environment that we find ourselves today for extended time and I canât get into projecting what the board might do in 2016 or beyond other than to say this action that was taken today we think makes sense for as far as we could see going forward assuming similar gold price environment.
Jorge Beristain
Okay and in terms of sustaining cost per ounce Iâm just trying to get a good kind of benchmark obviously your unit output volume is going up year-over-year in 2016 versus 2015, is $200 announced a good number and Iâm kind of surprised that we haven't seen more in the cost out in terms of you are receiving a lot of oil tailwinds and lower FX as well.
And if you could just also comment have you guys done enough heavy lifting in the cost department, we've seen a lot of your global mining peers recently started out some pretty large layoffs to their workforces to balance their cost and Iâm just wondering when do you think that the gold industry starts to cross that threshold?
Charles Jeannes
Well, maybe Iâll answer that last one first is I don't want to sound cocky, but you donât have to lay people off if you didn't get carried away and hire them in the first place. I think weâve got a right sized organization and I think if you look at our four consecutive quarters of declining costs and look at not just all-in sustaining costs which include sustaining capital and as we know that can be chunky and you can move them around, you can differ projects, you can differ investments in trucks and engine rebuilt and all that sort of thing, but look at the actual cash cost per ounce which I think we've done a very good job of managing those basic cost on a unit basis.
So we think that we have the ability to continue to attack that, weâve got a lot of opportunities in front of us Georgeâs all three teams continue to find ways to enhance efficiency and productivity and cut costs. So we donât think were by any means to the end of that and where we can and should go and we are going to keep at it very hard. As far as sustaining capital, weâve told you that you we run somewhere in the $875 billion a year range based on how we see our world right now in the portfolio mines we have and so you can do the math to figure out what that comes out to on per ounce basis.
Jorge Beristain
Okay, thanks and so if I could ask just quick one last one in for Lindsay, could you just help us reconcile just the thought process on page 23 of your power point where you detail for budgeting purposes like you're running at $1,200 gold scenario $18 silver and $3 copper versus your reserves, which I believe are booked at I'm not sure if I'm speaking correctly, if it's 1,200 to 1,300, but I just wanted to understand why there may be a difference between the budgeting price you're running and then the reserve cut off-price.
And then secondly, what your sensitivities would be to say a $100 lower gold price, one of your peers Newmont recently put the graphic that was pretty plain and simple showing the range of reserve life relative to different goals and so if you could maybe walk us through that thought process?
Lindsay Hall
Iâll attempt to probably use George, but two different process, one setting the budgeting for the revenue line one-year $1200 thatâs what we have used for 2015 budgets and obviously run a defensive various gold prices. So thatâs really for budgeting and cash flow and how you set up the balance sheet from a financing perspective and I think - so thatâs clear to you and I think when you talk about reserves and resource and price setting Iâll pass it over to George, and as the different process we are setting up reserves and resources obviously in a sense that is one of our long-term view what he is going to mine in the future years.
George Burns
Okay. So on a reserve basis we previously disclosed that if there was $100 an ounce decrease in the gold price to 1,200 an ounce versus our reserve price assumption of 1,300 that would have about a 2% impact on our reserves. And that doesn't include the offset that we see particularly in Canada and Mexico with the exchange rate.
So the way itâs reacting now that a $100 an ounce is largely offset with FX in both of our reserves. Does that help Jorge?
Jorge Beristain
It does. And is that linear, if we would say run it down to 1,100 you'd be talking about a 4% get to reserves?
George Burns
No, itâs not linear and I donât have that number at a 1,000, actually itâs about 5%, yes.
Jorge Beristain
Thank you.
Charles Jeannes
That excludes the impact of FX, itâs just toggling the gold price and leaving everything else to same which is not the case is whatâs happening in our world today is weâre getting big kickback on the FX to offset some of the gold price reduction.
Jorge Beristain
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the meeting back to Mr. Jeff
Jeff Wilhoit
Okay, thank you very much and thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. As I said this is a certainly a strong quarter for us at Goldcorp and sets us up for a successful year. Weâll remain focused on the things we can control and work to deliver the increasing production, reduced costs and then maintain our financial flexibility to succeed in a volatile gold market.
And I do want to emphasize that again we are long term bullish on the gold price, the short-term impacts will come and go they always have been in the business for long time. And Iâm confident weâre going to be cycling up again. So we will be prepared for that eventuality. So thanks everybody. Have a good summer and weâll look forward to speaking to you in the fall.
Operator
