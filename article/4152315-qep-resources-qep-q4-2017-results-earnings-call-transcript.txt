Greetings, and welcome to QEP Resources Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
William I. Kent - QEP Resources, Inc.
Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and CEO; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P business.
If you've not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results, along with the slide presentation with maps and other supporting materials.
In today's conference call, we'll use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled with net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risk factors facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Thank you, Will. I'll give you some color on the quarter and year-end results and outline our 2018 guidance and then turn the call over to Chuck, who will add some commentary around operational results before discussing the strategic and financial initiatives that we announced yesterday.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we generated $195.1 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $193.1 million generated in the third quarter and $174.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Production in the fourth quarter is 12.1 million barrels of oil equivalent, 2 million Boes lower than the 14.1 million barrels of oil equivalent we reported in the third quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the Pinedale Divesture in the third quarter. Recall that Pinedale contributed about 3 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter, so in the same-store sales basis, production was up about 957,000 Boes or 9%.
Oil volumes were 5.2 million barrels, up 414,000 barrels from the third quarter levels. Permian Basin oil volumes were up about 224,000 barrels to 1.9 million barrels, which was up 13% in the third quarter and almost double the volumes produced in the fourth quarter of last year. Williston oil volumes were up about 334,000 barrels due to our refrac program. Natural gas volumes were 34.1 Bcf, down 12.6 Bcf in the third quarter, but recall that Pinedale's gas production third quarter was about 15.8 Bcf. Haynesville's production was 24.1 Bcf, up 21% from third quarter and up 83% or 11 Bcf from the fourth quarter of last year. And NGL volumes were 1.14 million barrels, which was down about 25% from the third quarter, again attributable to the Pinedale Divestiture.
Our guidance for oil volumes for 2018 is 21 million to 22.5 million barrels, the midpoint of which is up 13% to the 19.2 million barrels we produced in 2017, excluding the 400,000 barrels of oil produced in Pinedale in 2017. Our guidance for natural gas lines for 2018 is 132 Bcf to 143 Bcf, an increase of 17.5% at the midpoint of range from the 117 Bcf we produced in 2017, excluding the 52 Bcf of gas produced in Pinedale, driven by growing volumes in the Haynesville and higher associate gas lines in the Permian Basin. Our guidance for NGL volumes for 2018, assuming that we'll be in ethane rejection all year at the locations at which we can make a recovery or a rejection election, is 4.7 million to 5.2 million barrels, the midpoint of which is up 9% from the 4.56 million barrels we produced in 2017, excluding the 811,000 barrels of NGLs produced in Pinedale in 2017.
QEP Energy's net realized equipment price, which includes a settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $32.21 per Boe in the fourth quarter, which was $4.41 per Boe higher than we realized in the third quarter and $4.90 per Boe higher than we realized in the fourth quarter of 2016. The weighted average field-level equivalent price in the fourth quarter was $33.65 per Boe, which was $6.68 per Boe higher than we realized in the third quarter.
The equivalent price reflects field-level crude oil prices that were $54.14 a barrel, natural gas prices that were $2.77 per Mcf, and field-level NGL prices that were $24.41 per barrel. Field-level crude oil revenues account for about 70% of total field-level revenues, which was about 13% higher than in the third quarter. Derivative settlements were an outflow of $17.2 million, resulting in a loss of about $1.44 per Boe in the quarter compared to an inflow of $11.7 million or a gain of $0.83 per Boe in the third quarter.
Combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $122 million in the quarter, down from $136 million in the third quarter and down from $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses were $6.58 per Boe, which is up $1.19 per Boe from the third quarter due to higher workover and repair expenses, primarily in the Williston Basin. Transportation expense was $3.54 per Boe, which was down $0.72 per Boe from the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Pinedale Divestiture and recovery of historical transportation costs.
Our guidance for lease, operating and transportation expenses for full year 2018 is $9 to $10 per Boe, which reflects decline per Boe numbers throughout the year as production ramps up and lower transportation expense due to the Pinedale Divestiture. First quarter numbers will most likely be in the range between $10 and $11 per Boe.
G&A expenses were $45.2 million in the quarter, up $1.8 million for the third quarter as a result of increased stock compensation expense and lower overhead recovery as a result of the Pinedale divestiture, partially offset by lower contingent liability expense. Our guidance for G&A expenses for full-year 2018 is $185 million to $205 million, of which approximately $25 million is share-based compensation expense and approximately $20 million is compensation expense related to the retention program associated with our strategic initiatives.
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $150 million. Driving net income was a $318 million (sic) [$308 million] decrease in our deferred tax liability related to the new tax legislation. Offsetting a portion of that gain was $122 million of unrealized loss on our derivatives portfolio, reflecting higher forward curve for oil and natural gas prices at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the end of the third quarter.
At December 31, the commodity derivatives portfolio was a net liability of $132 million compared to a net liability of $10 million at the end of the third quarter. In addition, we incurred $33 million of early debt extinguishment expenses and $51 million of impairment expense, primarily associated with gas properties in Wyoming, goodwill, and our gas storage facility.
Capital expenditures on an accrual basis for E&P activities in the fourth quarter were $372 million, an increase of about $45 million from third quarter. CapEx in the Permian Basin was $215 million which included $18.9 million from midstream infrastructure. CapEx in the Williston Basin was about $88 million, and CapEx in Haynesville was about $58 million.
In addition, we reported $684 million of acquisitions for the quarter related to the 2017 Permian Basin Acquisition. The fourth quarter capital numbers were significantly higher than we planned for a number of reasons, including taking delivery of equipment related to our midstream activities earlier than planned; performing three additional refracs in the fourth in the Williston Basin; completing our first 10,000 foot horizontal well in the Haynesville in December rather than January; and generally higher-than-forecasted well completion cost in the Permian Basin; and overall higher level of development activity in the Permian Basin.
For 2018, excluding acquisition and divestiture activity, we are forecasting the midpoint for capital spending to be $1.75 billion, which includes about $50 million for midstream infrastructure, primarily in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin will be allocated about 65% of the 2018 capital budget.
As you saw in our earnings release, we expect to have one rig in the Williston Basin and one rig in the Haynesville for the first half of the year, and the same level of activity in the Permian Basin, as we head in the fourth quarter. So, you should expect that our capital spend in the first quarter of 2018 will be about $375 million, which includes about $20 million for Permian midstream infrastructure.
Year-end proved reserves were 685 million barrels of oil equivalent, down 6% from the year-end 2016. Recall that at year-end 2016, Pinedale had 161 million barrels of oil equivalent of proven reserves. So, excluding Pinedale, reserves were up 114 million barrels of equivalent or approximately 20% from last year. We had 86.4 million barrels of equivalent of extensions and discoveries primarily in the Permian Basin. Acquisitions added 76.3 million barrels equivalent and higher SEC prices resulted in positive revisions of 32 (00:10:05) million barrels oil equivalent. Approximately 37% of proved reserves were developed and 56% of the equivalent proved reserves were liquids. The SEC PV-10 of the proved reserves was $3.1 billion and the pre-tax PV-10 of reserves was $3.8 billion.
With regards to our balance sheet, at the end of the year, total assets were $7.4 billion, and shareholders' equity was about $3.8 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.16 billion, of which $89 million was debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
During the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2026 and used the proceeds to redeem all $134 million of our 6.8% senior notes due 2018 and retire $84 million of our 6.8% notes due 2020 and $227 million of our 6.875% notes due 2021.
I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. We also announced that QEP's board has unanimously approved several strategic and financial initiatives designed to transition QEP to a pure-play Permian Basin company and to address a significant discount to net asset value reflected in our share price.
Given the importance of this these initiatives, I'd like to spend most of my time this morning reviewing each of them and giving you additional context around the board's decisions. Before I do, I want to quickly add some color around our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results. And as I do, I would ask that you please refer to the slide deck that accompanied our release yesterday for additional details.
2017 was a year of significant accomplishments and some unforeseen challenges for QEP. During the year, we were able to increase the size of our Tier 1 acreage position in the Permian Basin through a tax-efficient acquisition of over 15,100 acres in Martin County, Texas, while also completing the divesture of our Pinedale Anticline natural gas asset. We also had notable successes with our drilling programs in our core areas and with our refrac programs in the Williston and in the Haynesville.
In the Permian Basin, after some challenges early in the year, we made great progress on advancing the design of our tank-style development. During the year, we transitioned from our original two-tank design, which relied on the Dean formation to act as a vertical barrier between the Wolfcamp and Spraberry reservoirs to a single-tank design, accompanying both the Wolfcamp and Spraberry. As we migrated to the new design, we experienced some delays completing wells, and we also experienced some frac interference, with both producing wells and with wells that were being drilled as we migrated from two tanks to one. We believe those issues are largely behind us now, and we're encouraged by the recent well results, and we believe that tank-style development is the right approach to developing multiple producing horizons on our Permian assets going forward.
In the Williston Basin, we began our refrac program using a design which was closely patterned after the successful methodology that we are utilizing in our Haynesville wells. As a reminder, because of well spacing in the Williston, we have to shut in offset wells during these refracs and also obviously during new well completions, which has a negative impact on production volumes. While we're still fine-tuning our refrac design, we're very encouraged by the early results, and we look forward to continuing the program in 2018.
In the Haynesville, in addition to our ongoing refrac program, we also successfully completed two new drill wells utilizing state-of-the-art completion techniques. The first, completed in a roughly 5,000 foot lateral, had a peak IP 24 of 21.1 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day and an IP 30 of 19.5 million cubic feet a day. And the second completed on New Year's Eve in a roughly 10,500 foot lateral was turned to sales and subsequently cleaned up earlier this year to a peak IP 24 rate of slightly over 40 million cubic feet of gas per day. That well is very close to cumulatively producing 2 Bcf as of today. We're very encouraged by our ongoing refrac program and by the strong results from these two new wells that we turned to sales last year. And we look forward to continuing both programs in 2018.
Now, let's turn to the important initiatives we announced yesterday. So, as I mentioned earlier, QEP's board has unanimously approved a series of strategic and financial initiatives that are designed to transition QEP to a pure-play Permian Basin oil company. So, why are we doing these initiatives? Since our spinoff from Questar in 2010, we've been on a deliberate path to increase oil as a percentage of total production and proved reserves and to simplify our asset portfolio.
Through a series of acquisitions and two world-class oil provinces, first, in the Williston Basin, and then in the Permian, and through divesture of non-core gas-weighted assets in the Midcontinent and the Rockies, we successfully increased liquids from less than 15% of total production in 2011 to almost 50% last year. But despite these efforts, like many diversified E&P companies, we believe our stock price trades at a significant discount to the underlying net asset value of our assets.
The initiatives we announced yesterday, which responds to the feedback from a number of shareholders, are designed to do a number of things: first, designed to address a significant discount of our share price to the underlying value of the assets in our portfolio; second, to accelerate the transition to a leading pure-play Permian Basin oil company; third, we think we will improve operating margins by reducing drilling, completion, and operating and transportation costs by focusing on higher-margin crude oil production on our core Permian Basin assets; fourth, we'll manage our debt to maintain appropriate leverage for the recast company; fifth, we will address near-term funding as we continue to drive growth through the development of our core Permian position; sixth, we plan to return cash to shareholders through a significant share repurchase program.
So, how are we doing it? We outlined a couple of strategic initiatives. First, we've engaged financial advisors to assist us in the divesture of our Williston and Uinta Basin assets. And when I say Williston assets, obviously there's two assets: there's a South Antelope asset and the Fort Berthold asset. We'll present those as two separate packages, but obviously, we'll allow bidders to make offers on the one or both of those assets. And we also will have an advisor engaged to divest at our Uinta Basin assets. And we expect the data rooms for these first three packages to open in late March or early April. We also intend to market the remaining non-Permian assets, which primarily consist of our Haynesville/Cotton Valley assets in the second half of 2018.
We also announced a number of financial initiatives. First, we plan to use the proceeds from asset sales to fund development of our Permian properties until the program reaches operating cash flow neutrality, which we expect to occur in 2019. We'll also use proceeds to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through a significant share repurchase. Second, the board has authorized the $1.25 billion share repurchase program. And then the board also authorized the 2018 capital program of $1.075 billion, with approximately two-thirds of that investment being directed to the Permian Basin.
Since the exact timing of closing the assets is unknown, our initial 2018 capital budget and the guidance that Richard just went over with you assumes that we retain all of the current assets for the duration of 2018. Obviously, as we move through the year and we close on the divestitures, we will update you on our revised outlook for capital investment and for guidance.
So, why are we undertaking these initiatives? We believe as a pure-play Permian Basin operator, we accomplished a number of objectives: first, we simplified our portfolio, and we streamlined our operations; second, we concentrated our attention and efforts on our core Permian Basin assets where we believe we can deliver consistent production growth, reduce drilling and completion costs by continuing our tank-style completion activity. We also believe we can reduce operating costs as we drill more wells and abandon higher-cost vertical wells.
We moved to gas lift as our means of artificial lift to reduce artificial lift-related workover cost. And we take advantage of the share of surface facilities that we have developed to move oil and gas from the producing wells as well as source, distribute, reclaim, and dispose of produced water and flowback water. We also think we can expand our operating margins by dramatically increasing oil as a percentage of total production volumes, thereby generating superior returns at the corporate level.
As we advance the development of approximately 44,000 net acre core Martin County assets utilizing tank-style completions, we think we can simultaneously develop multiple sub-surface targets, while minimizing rig and frac crew moves, which should maximize capital efficiency by using shared surface facilities, maximize production and recovery of resource, and minimize the risk of interference and shut-ins of all setting producing wells and drilling wells. We are convinced that by executing the strategic and financial initiatives that I've outlined, we can unlock significant value for our shareholders while creating a highly competitive pure-play Permian Basin oil company for the future.
With that Rob, we can now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and answer-session. Our first question is from Gabe Daoud with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Gabriel J. Daoud - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Chuck, could we just talk a little bit about how we should think about, I guess, after-tax proceeds from all the sales, and just the tax leakage, and any NOLs that can offset that?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Good morning, Gabe. Look, we're not going to speculate on the sum or individual asset sale proceeds. I think from my career in the oil and gas business, whenever you put a number out, it puts a stake in the ground that describes the maximum expectation. And clearly, we think all of our assets are highly desirable. We've got feedback from our financial advisors that there'll be a robust market and interest in each of these assets as we go to market.
I will let Richard talk to you a little bit about the effective tax shields, et cetera.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Hey, Gabe. So, we think, through the combination of the NOL/carry forward into 2018, the IDC shield that we'll generate through the joint program this year and tax depletion that we'll be able to shield virtually all of the tax gain on those two packages. So, last year was a great year to do the 1031 exchange. This is a great year to do the sale with no flipping to new assets. So, we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to shield all the gain on sale.
Gabriel J. Daoud - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, Richard. That's helpful. And then, maybe on a pro forma basis, if we could just prioritize, I guess, use the proceeds from the asset sales, pay back debt. Does that come first before buybacks? And what kind of credit metrics are you guys trying to keep the business at longer term?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah, Gabe. I think, clearly, we're going to pay down the revolver. We're going to plug any cash flow shortfall from the operating activities this year. And then, with regard to what's left, obviously, we need to get our balance sheet in good shape. I think that the number that you've heard us talk about before is on a go-forward basis, we'd like to be at or below 2 times debt multiple of EBITDA. And you can do the math on what that looks like with the rest sort of geared toward the share repurchase program.
Gabriel J. Daoud - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, Richard. Just final one from me. For the 2018 guide, can you maybe just give us the sense of what kind of type curve you're using for the Permian, and what's flowing through the budget, either on like an IP 30, IP 90 or even just like an EUR basis, like how should we think about that?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Well, I think as we get more production data on these tank-style wells, we'll start to share more information in that. A couple of quick observations. One, with tank-style development, we're seeing a dramatic increase in pressure in the reservoir as we pump a lot of fluid volume into these wells. So, they flow naturally, but they also flow a high percentage of water and exhibit a longer cleanup than a single well would, if you just drilled a single well in any of these reservoirs â or even a handful, two or three wells, in these reservoirs.
So, I think a lot of folks' models need to be calibrated on, not reaching peak production within the first 30 days. In some instances, especially in shallower horizons, we see peak production after 90 days. So, it's important, I think, as you're calibrating your models to take that into account.
Gabriel J. Daoud - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.

Our next question is from Kevin Maccurdy with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Any comment on what OpEx cost would be for just the Permian-only assets and maybe the assumptions that are driving the outlook of free cash neutrality by the end of 2019?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Sure, Kevin. If you refer to the slide deck that we posted yesterday, let me get the exact slide number here, bear with me for a second. We actually gave you a sense for OpEx trend. When I think about OpEx, I'm thinking about a combination of both the LOE and transportation.
You can see that for the year 2018, we're forecasting a dramatic decline, about a third â a 33% decline from roughly $10 in 2017 to an average of around $7 for combined LOE and transport in 2018. Now that decline will take place over time, but we think it will average about $7 through the year as we bring on new wells and continue to drive down workover-related expense as we migrate to increasing percentage of our wells being lifted with gas lift versus ESPs.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
And, Kevin, if you recall, when we first entered the Permian Basin back in 2014, we were talking about operating costs, just LOE that was approaching $15 a barrel that we drove down to below $5 a barrel a year later. With regard to where we are today, we're on an LOE plus transport basis. We're sub-$10 a barrel, and we're up in a lot of vertical wells. So, we absolutely expect that to be a better number through the year.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Got you. And on the 95 Permian completions in 2018, how many frac crews do you need to operate that plan, and what does that imply for efficiency compared to last year?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
We'll average two. We may pick up an occasional third crew, but our frac efficiency is quite good. And I think, again, it's a testament to the efficiency of tank-style development and the contiguous nature of our acreage, because we all spend a lot of time rigging up and rigging down and moving that frac crews sit in one place and we work on multiple wells, then they rig down and move to the next half section basically. So, our tank-style development, coupled with just our contiguous acreage position, mean that our crews are pumping rather than rigging up and rigging down, and driving up and down the road.
Kevin Moreland Maccurdy - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Great. Thank you, guys.

Our next question is from Tim Rezvan with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Hey. Good morning, folks. I guess my first question, Chuck, you used the phrase stake in the ground in a prior response. A lot of people might say that $1.25 billion share price authorization is a very big stake in the ground. Can you talk about why the board felt such confidence in putting such a big kind of number out there, especially amid concerns that some people have, that you all will need to buy more inventory over the next one or two years?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Tim, that's a great question. First, that's a $1.25 billion authorization, and the caveat that we gave in the release yesterday, and I think Richard's already said it, is it's subject to market conditions, available liquidity, and the ultimate proceeds from asset sales.
Now, that being said, we have a 44,000 net acreage position in the core of the Permian, the northern part of the Midland Basin. And we think we've got more than adequate running room currently to prosecute a multi-year development program on those assets to drive peer-leading production growth and peer-leading returns. When we look at acquisition opportunities, we think the most attractive acquisition today is buying back our own stock, as we become a pure-play Permian company.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Okay. Okay, that's fair. And then on the Haynesville, you all have associated gas gathering there, which is generating an actually decent amount of EBITDA. I imagine that's included with the package, or is that a separate piece? And can you talk about what you think about EBITDA for that in 2018?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
So, Tim, we do have our own homegrown gathering system there, and it services the majority of the wells and the majority of the future growth. When we think about a potential divestiture, we would likely package it separately from the upstream asset, but again, offer a potential buyer the opportunity to acquire both the upstream and midstream assets.
And the reason behind that is some potential buyers have expressed interest in the combined assets and they also â because they recognize, I think, the optionality it provides and the enhancement in well level returns that owning and operating your own gathering system can present. As for EBITDA for 2018, it's around $40 million for the midstream asset. That's our forecast.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Okay. That's great. And then if I could sneak one last one in. There's a lot of large E&Ps with very big natural gas assets on the marketplace. I realize this is a back-half issue. Can you talk about kind of why you're confident and why you're signaling that you are going to put this asset out to the marketplace? And, I guess, why you think you can maybe get a fair price? Why maybe selling versus sort of keeping the asset for now?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Well, Tim, when I look at the quality of our assets â I just talked about a couple of our recent well results that are reflection of modern enhanced completion designs, which are triple the amount of proppant in higher stage counts. So, we're seeing what I think is a reset on performance out of the asset going forward.
We think the asset itself, the underlying economics, are very attractive. It's a unique asset in that it does present the buyer an opportunity to not only own the upstream, but also own the midstream, which further enhances the value. And from a locational perspective, the Haynesville is in an advantaged position relative to natural gas markets and export opportunities relative to most other gas assets that are currently on the market.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA LLC
Okay. I appreciate the responses. Thank you.

Our next question is from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Morning, gentlemen. Chuck, just a quick question there or maybe a clarification, if you would. Based on your plan that you and Richard have laid out to become free cash flow positive and decrease leverage, sort of post the sales, would you continue still running the five rigs in the Permian? And would anything on the development plan change as far as larger pads, or anything like that, or is that just sort of wait and see at that point?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Great question, Neal. Yeah. First of all, I think our pads are decent sized now, add more rigs or more wells to individual pads is probably not likely. Our base case assumption is we run five or six rigs. And obviously, dependent upon commodity prices, costs, the appropriate level of growth for standalone Permian company, we may look at adjusting that. But in the current price environment and current cost environment, we think five or six rigs is the right level of activity going forward.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And then once you become more of a standalone company, do you see yourselves potentially doing more vertical integration, sourcing sand, all those things that some of the other pure plays are already doing?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Look, we're already in the process of locally sourcing sand. We have, I think, a very elegant in-field system not only to gather our oil and gas, but also to handle our water, which has allowed us to have great operational flexibility. Beyond that, I don't expect to see us in the fracing business any time soon, if that was the embedded question.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Great to hear. Thanks, Chuck.

Our next question is from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Good morning, and congrats on the announcement, and thanks for taking my questions. Of the $3.1 billion PV-10 value at year-end 2017, can you break out the ballpark, how much of that is attributable to Permian PDP and PUD?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Hey, John. It's Richard. We typically don't break those numbers out. I think if you just did the math on the pre-tax number divided by the reserves, you kind of come up with an average of $5.50 per Boe in the ground without differentiating between what's producing versus non-producing. And so, if you think about gas reserves having a lower value intrinsically versus oil reserves, you can kind of maybe calibrate off of that $5.50 and say that the oil reserves are worth maybe 50% more than that and the gas reserves are worth half of that. So, without giving you a number, you can probably do some math around what that PV number looks like.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
And just to be clear on that, that's just the PDP PV-10 you're saying (00:35:17) $5.50 or that's the total?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
That's the pre-tax PV-10 divided by the total proved reserve number.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. Is there a rough split generally for just PDP of that total?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
I think the number we reported was the belt was 37%. And as an onshore company, we don't have a lot of behind-pipe stuff.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
The PV-10 PDP, not the overall reserves?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
We don't have that number out there.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. Fair enough. That's helpful. And just with regards to how much -previously, you guys had talked about balancing CapEx and EBITDA on 2018. I didn't see that mentioned as explicitly in the release. So, can you just comment on how much you anticipate outspending cash flow by in 2018 pre-asset sales?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know what the most recent consensus number for us for 2018 is, but I think the capital question was targeted to be plus or minus $100 million in excess of EBITDA. And then our carry costs with the refinancing we did last year is about $120 million for interest. So, that gives you kind of the ballpark of what that looks like.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
And, obviously, John, as we move forward through the year and divest assets, we'll reset the capital budget, and obviously it'll change the relative outspend.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, just to be clear with that, and so that was anchored to consensus estimates, or that was the internal model?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah, it's about the same.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, just last one for me, and I'll let somebody else hop on. Timing wise, if data rooms open up late March or April, should we be thinking about the kind of July plus or minus timeframe, or how should we be thinking about these updates?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
If you use the Pinedale Divestiture from last year's kind of model, that was a sort of five-month â start to finish. I think advisers were engaged end of April. We announced the transaction in the July and closed in the September. So, if you think five months from where we are today, that puts you some time in the August to early September timeframe.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
And that's to close.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
To close.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
That announcement could be a month or two prior to that?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah. So, again, you typically really give your buyers 45 to 60 days once you sign the PSA to get all his ducks in a row. So, again, we announced the transaction on July 24 then closed on September 20, so almost two months.
John Nelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Very, very helpful. I'll let somebody else hop on. Thanks again.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.

Our next question is from Park Carrere with Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
Hey. Good morning. Congrats on the announcement.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Thanks.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
And to follow-on John's question there, can you give a sense of timing for the divestiture process, for the whole process, particularly kind of a mention of the Haynesville, say, on the back half of the year? If it's a few months, do you think you have it all wrapped up by year-end?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Well, look, I think it's somewhat dependent on market conditions, but our plan is to start marketing the Haynesville asset in second half of the year. And if you take the same timeline that Richard elucidated, a close toward year-end or in the first quarter of next year would be reasonable.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
Got you. Okay. And moving to the back of the presentation, your well costs look relatively flat or even down a little bit. What do you expect for cost inflation in 2018?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Look, we've got some cost inflation baked into our capital forecast for the year. I'm not going to give you the exact number, because our Service Company friends will be at the doorstep this afternoon with their rate increases. But we think since â as a reminder, we're allocating about two-thirds of our capital to the Permian this year. We're in tank-style development mode, machine manufacturing, and as a result, we have some cost mitigants at our disposal, just the ongoing operations. We're doing some things on the pumping side, which we think will help us offset inflation. And as I mentioned, we're starting to source local sand, which we think will also be a mitigant to inflation.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
And when should we get our first results with the in-basin sand?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
It's probably going to be â well, it'll get pumped, so by the time you get flowback, it will be third quarter, before we have enough meaningful production.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
Okay. Great. And then one last for me, I assume with all the divestitures going on that the kind of midstream gathering and the Permian's stable for now.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a reasonable assumption. We need to think through long term, whether it makes sense to own the asset, bring in a partner. Those are the kinds of things we're thinking about.
Park Carrere - Scotia Howard Weil
Great. Thanks. Congratulations.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.

Our next question is from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.
Good morning, all.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Good morning, Derrick.
Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.
Chuck, transition over to the tank-style development program. As you think about what's right for balancing, what's right for the reservoir with the execution risk and facility costs associated with that style of development, what does that suggest as optimal in terms of how many wells each vertical tank should contemplate?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Well, when we think about it, there's a couple of things, Derrick. One is, as we've described in our previous calls, and I think it's really â there's a great picture in our slide deck on slide 11. We have two â there are three, actually, distinct activities. We have two barriers. One, which we call a pressure wall, which we developed between the frac crew and the existing producing wells; and then we have another barrier, which we call a buffer between the frac crew and the drilling rigs that are drilling new wells.
And the idea is to minimize or eliminate frac interference, either with producing wells or fracing into actual drilling wells. And the width of those buffers is an ongoing exercise in trying to minimize the number of wells in each one. I mean, at a minimum, there'd be four well stacked, vertically one in each of the reservoirs between the family of producing wells and the frac crew and a minimum of one well in each of the producing reservoirs between the frac crew and the drilling rigs.
And as we evolve the technique, that's our goal, is to minimize the number of wells that are in those two barrier areas. Right now, we have between two and three wells in each of them in various parts of the development. And our desire is to shrink that down.
Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.
Got it. And then given the results from your pilots, should we assume the schematic on page 13 as the go-forward development plan for Mustang Springs and County Line, or are you planning to test tighter density?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Well, we have a continuum of density from relatively low density in the Spraberrys 6 to 8 wells at low density, 10 to 14 wells at high density; and then in the Wolfcamps between 4 to 7 wells in the Wolfcamp A and 8 to 14 wells in the B. We're continuing to test various spacings in each of those reservoirs as we advance the tanks. And as we as we learn more, we will continue to update investors on what we think is the right spacing.
One of the things we've seen is â and it's elucidated on slide 12, we've seen that non-tank development and tank development are comparatively â the tank wells are performing at or better than non-tank wells and, in fact, even at increased density. So, the upper right-hand corner of slide 12 shows relative performance of higher-density pilots inside the tank versus lower-density pilots that were completed outside the tank.
And what we're seeing is the increased density wells, we think, are an indication of more stimulated rock volume, higher pressure support, because we see these wells when they first come online producing at rates that are 2,000 to 3,000 psi higher than discovery pressure, and what we think will ultimately result in higher recovery of oil in place.
Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.
Got it. Great answer. And then lastly, for me, given success of your refrac program in the Bakken, could you remind us of how many Gen 1 and Gen 2 refrac candidates you have in inventory? And if available, do you have a view on PV-10 uplift per well associated with those refracs?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
So, the answer to the first question is I don't have an exact number, Derrick, but my guess is it's about half of the total PDP well counts, Gen 1. And we had an intermediate stage of, like Gen 1.5 before we went to the 1,000 pounds per foot. So, the real question is, do we get a similar response in production uplift, restimulating a Gen 2 well, 1,000 pound per foot well? And we haven't done one of those yet, so we don't know. But my guess is we will see some response from even the more modern restimulating and more modern completion.
And look, the PV-10 uplift, we're still in early days of production performance on these wells. They look good from early time production performance. I can tell you, the first family, the first wells we did, which were over in a very poor area on the Fort Berthold Reservation, we saw a near doubling of EUR on those wells from the restimulation. And they're the longest live wells, so we have a better feel for production decline, since they've been through the flush cleanup period. But it's very economic and obviously, the infrastructures there, tank batteries, artificial lift, all the infrastructure's in place. Gathering systems are already laid. So, these are very attractive investments for us.
Derrick Whitfield - Stifel Financial Corp.

Our next question is from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Please proceed with your question.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Good morning. The $1 million facilities and artificial lift cost that you have in the presentation, does that include gas lift, or is that assuming the ESP, because I know that was as of year-end 2017?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
It assumes gas lift.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Okay. Great. And then when we look at the progression on the usage of water recycling, how do you guys see that kind of progress through 2018 and from 2019 and beyond?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
So, Gail, it's highly dependent upon the completion activity. If we maintain current completion activity, our goal is to recycle as much of the flowback water as we can to minimize additional sourcing from freshwater supplies or brackish water supplies. So, we set the system up to be able to reuse as much water as possible. But ultimately, the system becomes a net positive water producer over time.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Great. And then just one last question going back to the gas lift, do you guys use field gas, or are you bringing in?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
We're using field gas inside our gathering system at Mustang Springs. And one of the drivers of the transition from ESPs to gas lift was having enough gas inside the field to introduce gas lift into the wells going forward.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.

Our next question is from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on big picture midstream infrastructure in the Permian. Can you just remind us what kind of a production runway is supported if I leave that in (00:49:05) place now, and then what infrastructure you'll plan to build throughout this year? And just also any color on how you think about balancing that build-out with growth plans over the next couple of years would be helpful, too.
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
That's a great question. Obviously, one of the advantages of owning and operating your own in-field midstream infrastructure is you can keep in front of your development wave. And so, we've designed the system to accommodate the growth that we forecast, and we'll continue to increment it.
Obviously, we started at a point in Mustang Springs, and as we drill across the acreage and then turn around and come back to the east, we will continue to increment the system along the way, but the big infrastructure, the main gas gathering compression infrastructure, as well as the main oil handling and oil terminaling facilities are in place. And those were designed looking at our five-year forecast to be sized appropriately for the oil rates that we're expecting. So, we're in good shape, and we don't think that midstream infrastructure will be a limitation at all on either oil or gas side, and in particular, because it's become more and more of a focus on the water side.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then staying in the Permian, I know you mentioned the five to six rigs over the next couple years. Should we think about that as kind of a max for the position you've got so far, if not, what's a good number to think about in terms of the long-term maximum rig calendar (00:50:41) position as it stands today?
Charles B. Stanley - QEP Resources, Inc.
Jeoff, I think we could run more rigs, that's not a question. It's really around what's the appropriate level of capital investment to generate acceptable growth. And that's highly dependent on commodity prices and on costs. But we think five to six rigs does it. Could we add more rigs? Certainly, there's plenty of room to add more rigs on the assets that we have today. But near term, we think that it's appropriate to think about five or six rigs.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
All right. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Hey, guys. I appreciate the question. Well, thinking about your guidance range and your operating expense guidance, and given the relatively wide range, like if you're at the low end of guidance, where do you think cost per Boe would be; and then at the high end of guidance, where would it be? Because it actually matters a lot between how much you grow this year.
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
David, the guidance range, and you heard from my comment about what the first quarter looks like on a LOE per Boe basis, I mean, the guidance range is purposely big because we do expect to be able to drive down costs through the year. And the things that pop up, like workover expense that are recurring, but you can't plan them, really move that number around quite a bit.
Obviously, the labor side, the chemicals, all that is pretty straightforward, but it's the repairs and workovers that â when stuff breaks you have to make a decision to put it back on, especially if it's holding acreage. So, the range is purposely wide because of the things that we don't know when they're going to happen, but we know they will happen. So, that was the reason for the range being so wide.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Okay. Thanks. That helps clarify it. Thanks, Rich.

Our next question is from James Spicer with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.
James A. Spicer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone. In the context of the strategic repositioning, I'm wondering what requirements, if any, may be triggered under your indentures to redeem bonds? And then secondly, regardless of what you may be required to do, what do you think the pro forma capital structure looks like, broadly speaking, in terms of bank and bond mix?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah. James, I think with regard to the capital structure, that's always an interesting question because of what people's historical balance sheets look like. If you look at our debt-to-cap today, it's in the 30% range obviously, as we contemplate deleveraging to have the amount of debt be that two times or below level that we mentioned is our target post-divestitures.
Yeah, the debt part's going to come down and the capital part may not come down, so we may, from the balance sheet perspective, look really unusual and approaching a 20% to 25% debt-to-cap structure on a book basis. With regard to the indentures, yeah, we'll just have to see how the transactions unfold and do the analysis there with regard to what we're going to do our liability management strategy.
James A. Spicer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Right. So at this point, do you have a sense as to whether there's a -substantially (00:54:36) triggered in terms of requiring you to buy back bonds, regardless of what you may want to do, just to get down to your leverage targets?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah, James, we're not we're not to that level of the analysis yet.
James A. Spicer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, that's fine. And then, secondly, and I'm sure you guys have a good idea how much you want to get in or going to get in from these asset sales. What changes in the equation if you get more or less than you expect? In other words, if you look here between the alternatives of debt paydown, share repurchase, capital investment, which of those items have the most flex around them?
Richard J. Doleshek - QEP Resources, Inc.
Yeah. I think if you just think about what we talked about at the very beginning of Q&A, we're going to repay the revolver, we're going to plug any cash flow gaps, we're going to look at the balance sheet and make sure it's in a good position, and we're going â if we still think that there's a lot of value gap between net asset value and market valuation, we'll think about using proceeds for an aggressive share repurchase program.
James A. Spicer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's it from me. Thanks a lot.
