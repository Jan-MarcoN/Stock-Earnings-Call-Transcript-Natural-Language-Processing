Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Valspar Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tyler Treat, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tyler N. Treat
Good morning. Welcome to our Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. We have 2 speakers today who will provide insight on our business, the fourth quarter and full year results we announced this morning and perspective on our guidance for fiscal year 2014: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, Valspar's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparglobal.com.
And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report on our Form 10-K. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Hendrickson.
Gary E. Hendrickson
Thank you, Tyler, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and our improved sales momentum going into fiscal 2014. After a few highlights on the quarter, I will give you my perspective on last year and our outlook for 2014. Jim will provide more details in his remarks.
Our sales growth in the fourth quarter was strong. Sales increased 8%, and volume grew 15%. Excluding acquisitions, our sales increased mid-single digits. This growth was driven by new business wins in all of our major product lines. And as the U.S. market improves, particularly areas impacted by strengthening residential housing and construction spending, the benefit of our new business wins becomes more evident in our overall results.
In the U.S., we had sales growth of 12%, and volumes were up over 20%. We have had good sales performance in the U.S. all year, and that trend continued to strengthen in Q4. Our international sales were up low-single digits including Inver, down low-single digits excluding Inver, which is a continuation of the trend we have seen all year. Overall, it was a good quarter. We delivered sales and earnings at the high end of our expectations. Earnings per share increased 13% over last year.
Reflecting on the full year, we did not fully achieve the financial targets we set at the beginning of 2013. This was largely due to weakness in certain product lines in international regions following a very strong 2012. I am, however, pleased with the progress we made on our growth initiatives, new business wins and productivity programs. We also completed 2 outstanding acquisitions during the year, Ace and Inver.
2013 was a very strong year of new business execution. We delivered mid-single digit net new business growth in both our Paints and Coatings segments. We won significant new business in our packaging product line, particularly in the beverage can market, and we increased our sales of non-BPA products. The beverage can market is growing, particularly in Asia and Europe. Our volumes in packaging coatings were up high-single digits in the year.
Our coil and wood product lines also delivered significant new business in the year. Wood sales grew in the high-single digits with over half that growth coming from new business wins in both the U.S. and China. In China, we added new distributors; and in the U.S., we won business at key building products customers, which should grow nicely with the tailwinds from the U.S. housing recovery. In coil, our new business was driven by new technology in the metal building market. We strengthened our general, industrial and European business through the acquisition of Inver, expanding our presence in the large European coatings market and gaining a proven distribution model.
A notable performance in the year was the North American consumer Paints business, which delivered 16% sales growth and 29% volume growth. Excluding the Ace acquisition, our sales grew in the high-single digits. The business introduced a new line of Pro products at Lowe's and sales for this program have been very positive. Also contributing to Paint growth is our new business with Ace. We are manufacturing all of the Private Label paint volume for Ace, and over 500 Ace stores have been reconfigured for the Valspar Paint program.
We also remained focused on enhancing shareholder returns. We repurchased 5.9 million shares of the company's stock, an investment of $378 million. We also returned $81 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends. This morning, we announced our board approved a 13% dividend increase, marking our 36th consecutive year of increased dividends per share.
Looking forward, I expect a better year in 2014. We are planning for sales growth to increase 7% to 9% and for double-digit EPS growth. Jim will talk more about our 2014 plan in his remarks. But in short, our sales growth will be driven by the full year impact of Inver, the carry-over impact of our new business wins along with the continued focus on winning new business across all of our product lines. The investments we made in 2013 to enable growth will be more impactful in 2014. This benefit, along with restructuring actions and solid productivity plans we have in place position us well for a strong 2014.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim, who will provide some additional context on the 2013 results and guidance for this year.
James L. Muehlbauer
Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Valspar. I'd like to provide an overview of the key financial highlights from the quarter and our performance in fiscal '13. This background should provide helpful context as I move on to discuss our expectations for fiscal 2014. After the call, I encourage you to follow up with Tyler in the IR team with questions on the year-end details or assumptions for the next fiscal year.
Let's begin with the Q4 highlights. On last quarter's call, we noted that fourth quarter sales were expected to grow mid- to high-single digits and that full year adjusted EPS was anticipated to finish in the range of $3.45 to $3.55. The results we announced today are in line with those expectations.
Sales in Q4 increased 8% and represented our strongest growth quarter of the year. Key contributors to this increase included very strong performance in the U.S. market led by consumer paints in both the big-box channel and continued growth with Ace Hardware. Total sales growth in U.S. Paints was over 30% in the quarter. We also saw high-single-digit growth in wood and coil coatings products and a high-single-digit decline in sales from general industrial products as has been the case all year. Altogether, sales in the U.S. increased 12% in Q4.
Now turning to international sales. Sales in Europe increased driven by the addition of Inver and from improved sales in packaging coatings. The acquisition of Inver increased total company sales by approximately 3% in Q4. Sales in Asia were flat, as strong growth from the wood product line was essentially offset by lower sales in the balance of the businesses in this region. Latin American sales, excluding FX, were down slightly. In Australia, sales, excluding the impact of FX, declined mid-single digits in a professional market that was down high-single digits. Our results in Q4 were better than we had experienced in previous quarters.
According to recent industry data from the Australian Paint Manufacturers' association (sic) [Federation], we gained market share in both the trade and retail channels from the previous quarter. We are also growing our retail position with Masters Home Improvement stores. We recently displaced the market-leading Dulux brand at Masters and introduced the Valspar-branded products at the super-premium price point with a full range of interior and exterior products. We still have a long way to go to fully achieve our objective in this market, but these data points demonstrate that we are making progress.
The gross margin rate in Q4 of 33.4% was 60 basis points below last year, reflecting the mix impact from the addition of the Inver business and sales of Ace Private Label paints versus last year. As a reminder, we expect the near-term dilutive impact from Ace to improve in the second half of fiscal '14 as we exit redundant manufacturing costs and begin selling a higher mix of branded Valspar products. As Gary mentioned, we feel very good about the acceptance levels experienced to date in the Ace network, and we remain on track with our plans.
SG&A expense as a percent of sales finished at 20.8%, an improvement of 70 basis points. The improvement in rate was driven by leverage from higher sales in the quarter and reduced incentive compensation expense tied to our performance for the year.
Looking at the results in our Paints and Coatings segments for the quarter. Paints sales increased 13% led by double-digit growth in the U.S., offset by continued headwinds in China and Australia. EBIT margins finished at 11%, which was 35 basis points below last year and reflected our investment in growing the business and the dilutive impact from Ace.
Coatings segment sales improved 5% in Q4, as the addition of Inver and sales increases in the wood product line were partially offset by declines in the general industrial product line. EBIT margins of 15.5% were down 125 basis points. This reduction is primarily the result of Inver, which has lower EBIT margins than our other Coatings businesses and from the continued mix impact of lower sales in several higher-margin product lines. Bringing it all together, Q4 operating income increased 9%, and adjusted EPS improved 13% versus the prior year.
Looking back at that year in total, we had a number of big successes and key business wins. However, some of this good progress was muted in our results due to lower industry demand in several end markets and regions during the year. We improved sales 4% in the Paints segment in 2013. This growth was driven by very strong performance in the U.S. as the housing market continued to improve and through significant new business wins. Sales growth in the U.S. was partially offset by more difficult macro conditions in Australia and a slower housing market in China versus the previous year. Coatings segment sales for the year increased 2%. When you look closer at the details behind this growth, there is some good progress that took place in the year. Our wood and coil businesses had a good year with sales growth in the mid-single digits. In packaging coatings, we won new business and increased volumes high-single digits. We completed the year with the acquisition of Inver in Q4, which provides a platform for industrial coatings growth in Europe.
The growth challenges in the Coatings segment during the year were largely focused on general industrial markets, especially off-road, shipping container and pipe coatings. Each of these areas experienced lower end-market demand coupled, in some cases, with large customer inventory reductions. These product lines have historically been strong performers in our portfolio and remain well positioned for profitable growth as these markets recover over time. In total, we finished fiscal 2013 with operating income up 5% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 12.9%.
During 2013, we invested in value-creating restructuring programs to position Valspar for future growth and lower our cost structure. These initiatives included reducing our North American manufacturing footprint, restructuring our European manufacturing operations with the synergies provided by the Inver acquisition and by lowering our overhead in each region. Spending on these activities will carry over into the new fiscal year and will provide productivity benefits for 2014 and beyond.
We improved our working capital position and continued to generate strong cash flow in the year. Working capital improved to 12.7% of sales, excluding acquisitions, as we took action to manage inventories and improve our payable positions versus the previous year. Cash from operations increased 14%, and free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less CapEx and dividends, finished the year at approximately $200 million. We utilized a portion of this cash to improve shareholder returns through increased dividends and share repurchases as Gary summarized earlier. With this as context on fiscal '13, I'd like to move on and discuss our expectations for fiscal 2014.
In fiscal 2014, we expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $3.95 to $4.15, reflecting growth of 12% to 17%. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions: total sales growth of 7% to 9%, reflecting the full year impact of the Inver acquisition; carry-over benefits from new business initiatives, like Lowe's Pro, Ace, B&Q and in packaging coatings; and new business wins anticipated during the year. These items are expected to drive higher sales in both the Paints and Coatings segments in fiscal 2014 than the previous year.
We expect additional benefits from restructuring investments and productivity initiatives in 2014. A portion of these benefits will be used to fund continued investments in growth initiatives and higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense. We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32% to 33% and CapEx of approximately $120 million. And finally, while not included in our adjusted EPS guidance, we expect restructuring expenses in the range of $35 million to $40 million related to the carryover of the initiatives we announced in fiscal 2013.
In closing, Valspar has a strong portfolio of businesses with leadership positions in attractive markets. Our plans for fiscal 2014 focus on winning in the near term and building future growth to enhance returns for our shareholders.
With that, we would like to open up the call and take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Don Carson at Susquehanna.
Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
This is actually Chris Noon stepping in for Don. First, starting out, looking at the Paints segment, sales were really strong in the quarter, 13.4%. I'm wondering if you can kind of give us some more color and dig into how much each of those different initiatives contributed to that growth in the quarter and then also how you think each of those can contribute to the growth going out into '14.
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes, sure, Chris. This is Gary speaking. So North America, as Jim mentioned, we had a fantastic quarter in North America sales, up mid-30s in percentage terms. About half of that was shipments to Ace, both the Private Label shipments and we also started shipping the Valspar program in the quarter. Sell-through in the quarter was strong. We had sell-through in the -- at retail in the high-single digits across our distribution partners. And then the rest of it would be the Pro program at Lowe's, which we didn't have in the previous year and built a little bit of inventory that needed to be built in various channels to support the strong POS. So that was North America. As Jim mentioned, we -- Australia, although we made terrific, I think, sequential improvement in the Australia business in the quarter, was still a drag on the results. And Asia was also down kind of mid-single digits against a very, very strong quarter in 2012, and we were building inventory to support the affordable housing initiative that we had launched in that year. So yes, it was a good quarter. The major contributor was North America. But as I -- I'll repeat, Australia made great progress, and Asia had a good quarter in the context of a comparison against a very, very tough 2012.
Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Okay. Great. And then my second question is on the guidance range. You said top line is expected to be 7% to 9%. Can you maybe just go into a little bit how much of that is new business versus, I guess, kind of organic versus acquisitions?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, happy to, Chris. It's Jim. So as you look at that 7% to 9% range for next year, first off, I'd say one of the things that we want to provide investors with transparency to is just a view of what our overall sales profile for next year looks like in light of the significant new business wins we've achieved this year. As you know, the company hasn't historically provided specific guidance around the top line, but Gary and I felt it was important, given the significant new business wins and how we've talked about the different markets developing all year long, that we give you a little more color to assist you in your view of next year. So as you look that 7% to 9%, really, I would break it into a couple of big pieces. We're going to continue to have the benefit of the acquisition of Inver, which was initially recorded in the current year and in FY '13 starting just in the fourth quarter. So we're going to get a full year benefit from that. Call that roughly half of the growth in the top line next year. The other half of the growth is primarily coming from what I'll just bundle together as net new business consistent with what we delivered in -- at fiscal '13. That new business is going to include the continued build-out of the Ace program, the Lowe's Pro Initiatives, the further shipments that will be due next year around B&Q and certainly reflects the new business wins we've seen in other product lines like the packaging business for the year. So really, the other half the business is coming from kind of the organic growth levers that we've seen from a new business standpoint with the balance being driven by acquisition of Inver.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. First off, just want to get your thoughts on the European region and your legacy business there, just in the context that it seems that the Inver acquisition is proceeding pretty well for you. What are some of the end markets that are driving that solid performance with Inver?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Well, it's Gary. Our legacy business in Europe is mainly packaging coatings. So we have -- and we had a small industrial business, less than $100 million industrial business. So we tripled the size of our industrial business with the acquisition of Inver. So we have a -- we feel like we've got a much better balance of businesses in the European region right now. There are a number of strategic reasons that we did Inver, which I won't get into now. But I'll say that the integration process with Inver is going extremely well. We're very positive about the business, the synergies and the acceleration that Inver can provide us in strategic segments in Europe as a region. Inver had a -- and we only had 2 months of Inver, but we were ahead of our acquisition model in those 2 months. So -- but that doesn't really make a trend. But as I said, we're extremely positive about it. Packaging business had a very good quarter and they had a very good year in terms of new business growth. They took a significant market share in the region, and as Jim mentioned, in the quarter their sales were up mid-single digits. So those are our 2 legacy businesses. Packaging, we're very pleased with the quarter that they had and the year that we had. And we're just getting started with the, call it, the reinvention of Valspar industrial Europe.
Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Great. And as a follow-up, for the Paints business, can you talk about inter-quarter trends? Were there any major variances month to month?
Gary E. Hendrickson
No, it was a strong quarter for the whole -- the -- every month in the quarter was strong.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Your accrued liabilities went from about $340 million to $416 million sequentially. What's behind that?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, a couple of things, Jeff, is that when you look at the acquisition of Inver during the year, we're adding the accrued liabilities for that business. And then just as far as some of the timing of payments at year end and the restructuring expenses that we have in the business lifted that balance, so primarily driven by acquisition activity. Nothing else materially different year-over-year.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
How much did Inver add to your inventories and receivables in the quarter, rough terms?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, rough terms, it was about half of the growth we saw in the quarter. If you give me just one second, I'd be happy to look it up here for you.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Half of the growth year-over-year or half of the growth sequentially?
James L. Muehlbauer
Always year-over-year. So Inver was about roughly $36 million of growth in inventory.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And receivables?
James L. Muehlbauer
Don't have that number off the top of my head, Jeff. You want to follow up with Tyler to get the...
Tyler N. Treat
It's about $70 million, Jeff.
James L. Muehlbauer
$70 million.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
About $70 million.
Operator
And we'll go next to the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Gary, just on the retail initiatives, is it still true that they were basically breakeven in 2013? And if so, what will they be from an EBIT basis margin or dollars in 2014?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes, I'm not -- I couldn't even, if I'd wanted to, give you the exact number, David, but I'll repeat what Jim said relative to Ace. Ace will become accretive after we exit redundant manufacturing costs, which will take us about another 5 or 6 months. So we're calling it accretion in the second half of this year. The B&Q initiative in the year will still be slightly dilutive, less dilutive than it was this year. But really, those are really immaterial numbers, David. They're small numbers in the single-digit millions. And the Lowe's Pro business, we've built out the infrastructure to support that business now and we're -- the product is selling through, so we're at more or less the normalized run rates that we should see for that business today.
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes and we'll see a full year impact of that in FY '14. Remember, we just set that business with Lowe's in the spring of '13.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Will Ace be positive in 2014 overall?
Gary E. Hendrickson
It will be, yes.
James L. Muehlbauer
Absolutely, yes.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And then just lastly, restructuring wise, what will the benefit be in 2014 year-over-year?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes. So we've talked to a couple of the components of the restructuring, what we -- the North American manufacturing restructuring, we anticipate that on a full year run-rate basis by the time we complete those activities in FY '14, it should be worth about $0.10 a year in EPS. We'll see that fully in FY '14. So in -- I'm sorry, in FY '15. In FY '14, we'll see it somewhere in the range of, I'd say, $0.04 to $0.06 from those initiatives. The other part of the restructuring portfolio really related to the Inver acquisition. And when you bundle all the activities we're doing with Inver along with the restructuring activities, we've previously called out about $0.10 of accretion next year for Inver in total including restructuring.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research
I wondered if you could give us an update on raw materials. How did those trend during the quarter? And what's kind of your outlook for 2014?
Gary E. Hendrickson
They were pretty much flat during the quarter, Kevin, and our outlook is for, let's just say, modest inflation in '14.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research
Okay. And looking at the B&Q rollout, where do you stand on that today? How many stores are you supplying? And when do you expect those to be fully stocked in all 350 or so B&Q stores?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes. So we're just now starting. We've had 30 set for at least a quarter, maybe as much as 2 quarters, Kevin, and really just learning more about the partner program with B&Q. So now we're -- we've entered into the phase where we're going to start rolling them out very quickly. And the objective is to have all 350 stores set by June.
Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research
Okay, great. And final question, it sounded like you saw a bit of a pickup in Australia sequentially, not year-over-year but sequentially. Was this entirely due to the new business wins replacing Dulux at Masters? Or did you see some organic growth as well?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, no, the new business wins at Masters were not a driver of the improvement that I spoke about in the script. It's really the improvement in market share that we saw in both the retail and trade channel. We also anniversaried the actions we took last year to close unprofitable stores. And our team has done, I think, a wonderful job of executing better with our partners over there and building programs with the trade that are gaining traction. So as I mentioned, we've made good progress. We've got ways to go to. That housing market is going to continue to be challenged, but coupled with the restructuring activities we've done to improve the cost structure of the business and now seeing a little bit of stabilization in the top line, we're in a position to really benefit from the future growth as that market comes back.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I was just trying to get a sense of what could be with the B&Q relationship, and I guess the most reasonable proxy would be what you do in the U.S. So can you sort of compare when this thing is at full rates and meeting your plans, how it compared to unit economics and sell-through and margins and those sorts of things that you might achieve in the U.S. currently?
Gary E. Hendrickson
B&Q is an important first step for Valspar in our European consumer strategy, Bob. We don't expect that B&Q is going to be -- or in the short term, anything like the scale of the business that we have in North America. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce our brand into the U.K. and Ireland market with a fantastic retailer. It'll be a good program for them. It'll be a good program for us. But it's really, for us, we think about it as the first step in our European strategy. We're not going to talk a lot at this stage about what the subsequent steps would be.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
All right. Let me shift gears, if I might, to Australia. You put in the branded product there. Is this something where we should expect that to continue to take a bigger and bigger share of shelf space there? And should we assume, as in the U.S., the branded product is going to come at a much more attractive margin than a private label?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes, we've put -- so Bob, the way to think about it is Valspar is now part of the retail mix at Masters. It's positioned at the super-premium price point, the most expensive paint in the store. And we have developed a paint for that market which has features and attributes that support that positioning, extremely good paint. It becomes part of a mix with our Wattyl brands. Essentially, Valspar now has 75% to 90%. I don't know the exact number, Bob, but the vast majority of the shelf space at Masters with legacy Wattyl brands, the very strong brands that we acquired with Wattyl and now with Valspar. So it's a significant -- if you think about the rollout of Masters to 150 stores in the context of the business in Australia, it should be very good business for us.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
This is Andrew Dunn on for Ivan. Just Looking at your FY '14 sales expectations, you were nice to break those out. Just if you look at the international markets and general industrial market, would you say that your expectation baked in there is for flat or maybe even continued a little bit headwinds in those end markets?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, in general, we're anticipating just a little bit of continued headwind in those markets. Our guidance does not reflect the fact that they will be down as much as they were in FY '14. But as we've talked over the last couple of calls, we're not in the position to call when those markets are going to fully recover. So really, what's reflected in next year's view is not the same level of declines we saw this year and just a little bit of continuing headwind in the business.
Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. And then you did mention some proliferation of your non-BPA coatings. Are you -- is it -- you guys, you're really starting to see some meaningful adoption now? And then related to that, is the market share that you're taking related to these products?
Gary E. Hendrickson
The market share that we spoke about, Andrew, was not related to these products. It was mainly in beverage. Although that's the headline number I would say. We have taken market share in non-BPA coatings as well, but that segment of the overall packaging market is still small. So adoption is taking place. It's taking place at a measured pace, and we're participating in that with the technologies that we've developed. It's -- they're not huge numbers at this point in time, but I think the important point to take away is that -- for potential investor in Valspar is that we're the global leader in packaging coatings, and we've invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars, at least, maybe not $200 million but well over $100 million in developing new generations of coatings for the market that are -- that do not contain BPA. And if the market does accelerate and it switched, then we are extremely well positioned to win.
Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Okay, great. And then just one final question, if you could comment maybe a little bit more on trends in some of your secondary, more residential markets in China?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes, I think China is -- you're talking about consumer, correct?
Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Correct.
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes. I think that, that market has stabilized. Let's say that. I'm not -- I won't go so far as to say that it's on a significant growth trend again, but I would say that in the last couple of quarters, our team there feels like the sentiment is slightly better as the market has stabilized. And the one market that has continued to grow is the affordable housing market, which is being supported by the Chinese government. That was responsible for a pretty significant shift in our business this year. We've been very successful launching products for the affordable housing market, and our volume growth in that segment was really strong in the year. So net-net, I feel like we are positioned for a reasonable year in China through the introduction of those new products in a market that's stabilized.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of John McNulty at CrÃ©dit Suisse.
John McNulty - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
A couple of things. First, on the cost of the program ramps that you've been working on, can you, first of all, quantify or give us some color as to what those costs are? And then also how much of them potentially drop off once the platforms are up and running versus kind of getting just overwhelmed with all the revenue coming in?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes. John, it's Jim. I'm not going to go into the details of the cost of each of the programs. But to talk about the big drivers in general and how they're going to behave going forward, I think it would be best to characterize the costs we have incurred to roll out programs like Ace in a couple of folds: One is we're certainly investing in the marketing and the launch of that brand in conjunction with Ace in the stores next year. That will be part of an ongoing investment that we'll leverage even further once we get out of 2014, as we build more volume in the business. So we're going to have initial launch and marketing costs, but I would not put them in the category of onetime expenses that we'll take out of the business going forward. We'll just get more leverage from the sales lift that we see in that space. The other thing that we'll see, and we have a little bit of this going on with our Lowe's Pro Initiative as well, is one of the reasons Valspar is successful in partnering with retailers is that we bring value-added services in the way of helping train teams how to sell paint, actually helping them execute on the store and merchandise the shelves. We've invested both with B&Q -- I'm sorry, both with Lowe's on the Pro Initiative and with Ace in hiring people to do that in advance of the ramp of those volumes. So we incurred a lot of that expense this year. That's going to be in our run rate, that we'll be able to leverage the top line growth in both of those initiatives next year. And then lastly, as Gary mentioned, B&Q is a little bit of a different story. We're investing in the launch of that product in the marketplace. We'll have initial marketing expenses. We're working on a strategy to locally source the products over time, which will improve margins and will give us a little bit better run rate from an operating profit standpoint in that business. But as Gary also mentioned, we're not looking at that in the next 2 or 3 years as being a big bottom line driver of Valspar's total performance. We're very concerned about doing things well with B&Q in launching the brand successfully for both of us in that marketplace.
John McNulty - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, great. No, that's helpful. And then just one other question with the Ace business. I believe you'd said in the opening remarks that you were in -- I wasn't sure if that you were in 500 stores with the Valspar brand or you've gotten 500 of the franchisees to sign up and you will be in those stores. So what was that?
Gary E. Hendrickson
We are in over, as of this morning, over 550 stores that have been totally reset with the new paint department. And we have commitments from over 3,000 of the Ace dealers to take that program before May.
John McNulty - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, so you're over -- so you're pretty much at 3/4 of all the franchisees tied into that platform. Is that about right?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Well, some of them probably more -- it's probably higher number than that, John, because a number of the Ace stores don't have a paint department. So if you did the math on the number of paint departments or number of Ace stores that actually do sell paint, we're probably closer to 80%, 85%.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of P. Juvekar with Citi.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So in off-road machinery and shipping containers, these segments have been weak for most of 2013. I guess, can you give us some color? Has the pace of weakness sort of started to moderate? And when can we start to anniversary sort of the worst of those sales declines?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes, that's -- we haven't seen any material improvement in any of those markets, Dan, and none of our customers are talking about material improvements in those markets in 2014. And that's the way we've built our plan for the year.
Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay, that's great. And then on capital allocation, you made a real -- some really good progress in reducing your share count over the past 2 or 3 years. And like you said, you did a 4% reduction this year. So is this a pace that we should continue to expect in 2014?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, Dan, it's Jim. Certainly, the ability to invest in the business, pay dividends and as opportunities make themselves available, to do strategic acquisitions like Inver and continue to enhance shareholder returns through share repurchases, is part of what we think is a winning formula for shareholders. So we absolutely expect to continue share repurchases next year. The magnitude of which will depend upon the opportunities we see in the marketplace. What we said historically is, publicly, we're committed to offsetting dilution in the business, so a minimum of kind of 2%. We certainly purchased at a rate that's higher than that this year. And we continue to feel like we've got a great position to grow the business and enhance shareholder returns by continuing share repurchases. So we're not going to pin down to a certain percentage today, but it's still very much part of our playbook, and we seek significant opportunities over time to continue enhancing returns.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I guess first question, I think on the last call, you guys had said that the tax rate would be up in the fourth quarter, and it came in below what most people were expecting. So what changed there?
James L. Muehlbauer
Charlie, it's Jim. The key thing that changed is that we had some favorable tax elements related to a couple of positions we had internationally that were outstanding that we got resolution on during the quarter. We had originally planned that those were going to happen more in next year, so we were pleased to see the acceleration of that. I guess from a big context standpoint, if I take those items out, we're basically in line with where we thought we were going to be. We just had a timing shift of those items.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay, great. And then I just wanted to clarify something you said about the restructuring benefits that you're going to see in the Paint business, that $0.10 a year. Did you guys make a comment that part of that will be reinvested back in the business, so we won't see the full benefit of that in '14?
James L. Muehlbauer
Two things, Charlie. What I was commenting on is one of the restructuring initiatives that we announced in 2014 -- sorry, in 2013 was in the second quarter, and it was really around restructuring part of our North American manufacturing base. Paint was just part of that restructure activity. What I was commenting is that the time we made those investments that we anticipated that we would see a run rate improvement in EPS of $0.10 by the time we got to FY '15. So I wasn't labeling that specific to the Paint business, number one. Number two is as we think about productivity next year and how we're going to manage our investments in the business, we're going to see benefits in productivity from those initiatives along with our normal productivity measures, but at the same time, we're going to continue supporting the important rollout of Ace, B&Q, Lowe's Pro and the other new business initiatives. So what I'm trying to set up is a stage of we're doing a good job managing productivity. We expect margins to continue to improve, but we're also going to be continuing to reinvest a portion of those margins in growing the business for the right reasons over the long term.
Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay, great. And it seems like some of the improvements that we're going to see next year you've called out as being back-end weighted. Any color you can give on overall sort of segment margins and the pace of EBIT growth through the year, I think, would be helpful to us.
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, I think the comments that we provided around back-end weighting, Charlie, I think you must be attributing those to how we've been characterizing the portfolio improvement coming from Ace in the back half of the year. Certainly, as we look across the balance of the businesses, we're exiting with some pretty strong momentum this year. So from an overall back-end weighting standpoint, when you compare the growth that we saw in fiscal 2013, that was largely concentrated in Q3 and Q4. We're not looking at a weighting next year that looks consistent with that. We're going to have a little more balance in our weighting overall. But you're right to call out kind of in Q1, as we ramp some of those initiatives and as we look for productivity to increase as we get into the back half the year, we should see a little bit more upside in our overall margins.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division
In your revenue guidance, you split it out between new businesses as part of the driver. That sort of implies maybe $160-or-so million of new business improvement next year. And I believe at one time, the expectation was with the Ace, B&Q and everything else to achieve around $400 million by 2015. So is it right to assume that you're expecting 40% in 2014 and another 60% in 2015 of your original $400 million?
James L. Muehlbauer
Yes, Nils, I wouldn't quite parse it that way. The $400 million of improvement that we're talking about historically is really related to the retail paint initiatives and what we expected over '13, '14 and '15. The new business growth run rate that you mentioned of roughly $160 million would include this year's increase from those components along with the increase that we expect to see in our packaging business from wins in that space and our general industrial business. So you really have to look at that build of $400 million. Part of it's in FY '13. Part of it's in '14. Part of it's in '15. What I'm trying to give a little more color on, as you think about the business in total, is, one, year-over-year, we're planning for about the same level of new business growth next year in '14 that we saw in '13; and two, the other additional growth that we'll see is coming from the full year benefit of having Inver in the portfolio.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division
Got it. I think in the second quarter, there was the expectation of around $18 million to $23 million in restructuring this year, and it came up -- came in much higher than that. Yet the guidance, I think, for the benefit is still $0.10. So could you help us understand, is it just that things are worse than expected? Or you have to do more to get that same $0.10? Or just trying to understand why the $0.10 isn't higher given the more restructuring that's been done.
James L. Muehlbauer
No, I think we're talking about apples and oranges a little bit, Nils. So what you're referring to is, back in Q2, when we talked about the North American restructuring, what we provided as an overview is the after-tax impact of the restructuring initiatives in the after-tax cost -- I'm sorry, yes, the after-tax cost. That was a 2-year number. So that was going to be incurred in FY '13, in FY '14. After Q2, we announced the acquisition of Inver, at which time, we said we were going to have higher restructuring expenses because we had a great opportunity to look at our European manufacturing base and close some facilities and move some other plant lines around, which was a great benefit for us as well. And then we also took some actions in the back half the year related to reducing our overall infrastructure costs and overhead in each of our regions. So the numbers you were referring to back in Q2, that was kind of the stage 1 of restructuring. Since then, we've kind of -- we've pulled the lever on a couple more initiatives with Inver and other items. So the total restructuring that you saw this year, roughly $36 million, is the combination of those 3 programs, not the one program that you referred to.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division
Understood. I wasn't sure if it was really apples to apples.
James L. Muehlbauer
No, that's fair.
Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division
And then finally, haven't heard in a while the -- what's going on or how successful the introduction of the Valspar brand is in Tier 1 cities in China. Could you give us an update on that, please?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Still small. As we said, we're just -- we're, Nils, we're going to try a couple of tests and we're still testing, but it's still small. We're experiencing some success in the project channel, which is where we're focusing our efforts right now. Retail, we're still testing various models.
Operator
We'll go next to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Could you talk about what you see in terms of M&A potential for 2014 and whether they would be more domestically or international?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Well, we did 2 great ones this year, Rosemarie. We did one domestically, and we did one internationally. And if we could do that again next year, I think we'd all be -- we'd be very pleased. And as always, we're talking to a number of different parties about those opportunities. But we -- we're never going to comment ahead of time. M&A has been part of Valspar's DNA. We've done a lot of acquisitions over the years, and we'll continue to do them in the future.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
I guess, I was wondering if you were going to take a break while you absorb the last 2.
Gary E. Hendrickson
Not if we can help it.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Okay. And then when you look at the -- when we look at the wood business, it grew mostly in North America or maybe I misunderstood. And I was wondering, linked to this, what was happening in China, if you are growing wood coming -- I mean, for exports type of business or is -- it is also growing in the domestic Chinese economy?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Both. So I'll just answer the question comprehensively I hope. North America wood had a very solid year this year with growth in the high-single digits. About half of that growth, we think, came with the market recovery, and about half of that growth came with new business wins. The same is true in China. They had a year that was actually stronger than -- in terms of growth, than the North American business did. And that came partly through improving exports and/or winning share with exporters and partly through growth in -- of our business in the domestic Chinese economy.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
Okay, that is very helpful. And one last question if I may. So there -- isn't there a regulation in Europe requiring coatings going into food application to be non-BPA?
Gary E. Hendrickson
There is a forthcoming regulation in France, only in France, Rosemarie, that will affect -- could potentially ban BPA in food and beverage cans. And the industry is preparing for that eventuality, and we're participating in that preparation.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
So if France bans it, don't you think that Europe -- the rest of the European countries are going to do the same? And if so, how large is that market?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Yes. I would just be speculating on the first part of your question. The second part of your question, the packaging coatings market in Europe is the largest packaging coatings market in the globe, which is why you've heard me talk excitedly about our opportunity in Europe if the market does start converting to non-BPA coatings because our position in Europe is less in terms of market share, significantly less, than it is in North America, and we see the European market as a big opportunity for us to grow with our new technologies.
Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.
And when you are talking about this large market, is it all potential for conversion to non-BPA? Or does it apply only to certain segment?
Gary E. Hendrickson
Anything on the inside of a can, I suppose, is a potential part of the market that could shift. The exterior of the can, which is probably 25% or so of coatings that are sold there, probably won't switch in the short term. But the interior of the can, anything that touches food or beverages has a potential to switch.
Operator
And that will come from that line of Steve Swartz, First Analysis.
Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division
So question about your revenue guidance for '14. If you back out Inver, that cuts it in half. You mentioned that you expect modest raw material inflation, so maybe you get 1% of pricing growth. So you're down to maybe 2.5% or 3.5% revenue growth and then that's -- if you back out the new business wins, that kind of implies that you expect your legacy business to be flat. And within the legacy business, you still have the Lowe's in North America growing. So are there markets where you actually expect them to continue to decline in FY '14?
Gary E. Hendrickson
You've done your math extremely well, Steve.
Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division
Not that it will do anybody any good.
Gary E. Hendrickson
I would say this, to kind of wrap the call, is that we -- first of all, we're going to have a little bit of an FX headwind that you may not have in your model. In the Australia -- the Australian dollar has declined pretty precipitously in the last couple of quarters, mostly in the fourth quarter. The Brazilian real declined precipitously. So we've got some FX headwind that you may not have modeled. And I would say revenue -- our revenue guidance may be somewhat on the conservative side in the sense that we're not expecting any recovery in these industrial markets and in the context of a pretty tough year this year. So I'll just leave it at that.
