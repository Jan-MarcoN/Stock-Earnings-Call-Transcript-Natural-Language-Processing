I would now like to turn the call over to Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Takia. Good morning, and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at Praxair.com in the Investor section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that year-over-year and sequential comparisons exclude previously disclosed non-GAAP adjustments. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.
Matt and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter EPS finished at $1.39, which was at the upper end of the guidance range. This was driven by a combination of factors including volume trends, foreign exchange translation and a lower tax rate. Overall, we continue to see strong growth in our more resilient end markets while the cyclical market trends have been mixed, with metals improving but manufacturing still a challenge. Global volumes were flat year-over-year but up 3% sequentially due to broad-based recovery off a weaker first quarter.
In North America, trends have played out as anticipated. We continue to see solid sequential volume improvement across our on-site business, specifically in metals and downstream energy. You may recall that the first quarter had significant turnaround activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, but we saw a very strong rebound for the second quarter.
In addition, steel import tariffs have supported margin improvement and hence production rates for our steel customers. Merchant volumes also have improved sequentially as we continue to see strong demand from food, beverage and other consumer-related markets.
However, the packaged gas business is still declining from weaker manufacturing activity. U.S. industrial production for the second quarter is down more than 1% from prior year, and both the machinery and fabricated metal market IP figures are down over 3%. Packaged gas end market trends often lag industrial cycles, so they'll likely be a few more quarters of challenging conditions. We are stepping up cost actions given this outlook, so I expect some improvements by the fourth quarter.
Finally, we continue to pursue new customer on-site opportunities connected to our expansive Gulf Coast pipeline network. While these projects take considerable time to bid and negotiate, we're making good progress toward new contract signings.
South America appears to be stabilizing for a few months in a row. The political situation in Brazil has enabled an improvement in the financial markets and the real, which should support higher industrial activity at some point in the future. Our volumes this quarter have grown 3% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, which represents the first year-over-year positive volume growth since 2014. Approximately one third of our portfolio serves consumer-related markets, and they continue to grow quite well from the expansion of the middle class. Furthermore, we've seen sequential improvements in metals from a new project start-up and a slight improvement in manufacturing, although off a fairly low level.
The near-term outlook is still cautious for industrial activity, given current trends and the government challenges. But I'm confident that the business is well positioned when those industrial markets turn around. Europe is continuing on a path of slow and steady improvement. Volumes and price are up year-over-year with a strong sequential improvement in volumes at 6%.
Large projects in Russia and Port of Antwerp are contributing as expected to the results. We also just completed two large acquisitions for the European CO2 business and bought out the partner from our Scandinavian joint venture. Fixed costs are higher this quarter due to on-time acquisition costs and integration of the acquired business, which has near-term pressure on margins.
However, those costs will be managed as part of the deal synergies, which will lead to additional margin improvements into 2017.
In our Asia segment, we continue to see mid-single digit volume growth but a challenging pricing environment, primarily in China merchant liquid. Despite the industrial overcapacity across many regions in China, our Tier 1 on-site customers continue to run well as they operate some of the most competitive assets for their industry. Metals have improved sequentially due to seasonal patterns and a project start-up in India. We continue to see growth in chemicals and electronic customers in China and Korea, and merchant growth rates are positive across most end markets.
The pricing environment in China has pressured margins, but cost actions have helped mitigate most of the impact. We have several initiatives underway to migrate toward faster-growing more resilient end markets like food and beverage and environmental and healthcare. These applications are smaller but highly accretive and less capital intensive.
Our surface technology business has had relatively flat performance sequentially and year-over-year. Improvements in Aerospace and highly engineered materials like powders for additive manufacturing have been offset by significant headwinds in the energy and industrial end markets. I anticipate we'll lap some of the more difficult comps for energy and manufacturing toward the back half of this year. Furthermore, the completion of the joint venture later this year should help further improve Aerospace growth opportunities.
In general, the second quarter trends have either been in line or slightly better than originally expected. On-site and merchant supply modes have mostly improved sequentially while North American packaged gases continue to be challenged. The severe headwinds from Latin America, metals and upstream energy have stabilized and we expect to lap most of them in the second half, although we're not projecting a recovery.
The manufacturing end market remains quite weak as the negative effects from the commodity collapse and strong U.S. dollar work their way through the supply chain. Despite these difficulties reflected in the income statement, we continue to deliver on cash generation. Operating cash flow this quarter grew almost 30% sequentially, and was in line with prior year, even with lower earnings. Net debt has increased approximately $200 million, as expected, to fund the $360 million of synergistic acquisitions when including both the CO2 assets and the buyout of our noncontrolling JV partner.
Now that the large acquisitions have been completed, we plan to lower net debt for the remainder of the year while avoiding any share dilution. We remain firm on executing the strategy. We are optimizing the base business through self-help actions which are visible in the business quality and strong free cash flow. We are growing resilient end markets, as demonstrated by the portfolio growth trends. We're capitalizing on acquisition opportunities through recently announced synergistic tuck-in deals, most of which serve Brazilian markets. And we are executing the backlog while positioning for key growth project wins in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
I'd now like to hand it over to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Matt. Please turn to slide number four for our consolidated results. Overall sales were $2.7 billion, 2% higher than last year, excluding currency and cost pass-through. Price attainment contributed 1% growth and was achieved in several reporting segments. Acquisitions added 1% growth, largely due to the European Carbon Dioxide acquisition that was completed in early June.
New on-site project start-ups contributed to volume growth, with the revenue more than half weighted towards Asia and the remainder of the revenue contribution largely in Europe and South America. In addition, we continue to see solid growth out of the more resilient end markets globally, with food and beverage and healthcare both growing 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by lower base business volumes in the Americas, due primarily to weaker industrial manufacturing activity in the United States and Brazil as well as weaker upstream energy in North America. Sequentially, volumes were up 3% versus the first quarter. About half of the volume growth is related to hydrogen sales in North America, given fewer customer turnarounds, and the remaining half is attributed globally to seasonal improvement and project contribution.
By operating segment, North America organic sales declined 1% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The business achieved price in merchant and packaged gases. Weaker U.S. packaged gas volumes drove the majority of the volume decline year-over-year, largely due to hard goods. The remaining volume softness included continued lower upstream energy sales in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. However, this was partially offset by stronger merchant growth to the more resilient end markets and the improvement in hydrogen sales to refineries given fewer customer turnarounds. Sequentially, organic growth of 3% was largely driven by the increased hydrogen sales as well as volume growth to food and beverage, healthcare and chemicals end markets.
In Europe, organic sales grew 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by project contribution in Russia and Antwerp, and merchant volumes largely serving food and beverage and healthcare customers. Sequential volume growth includes a seasonal pickup from the Easter holiday in the first quarter, project contribution and modest growth across all end markets.
South America's organic sales grew 5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Year-over-year volumes again outperformed local industrial production as growth in healthcare and food and beverage, as well as project start-up contribution, mitigated continued volume declines in manufacturing. Sequentially, organic growth included higher price actions as well as volume growth from the healthcare end market and a new on-site start-up serving a metals customer.
Organic sales in Asia were 5% higher than last year, primarily driven by new project start-ups in China and India. Sequentially, volume growth of 4% included seasonal improvement. Surface Technologies' organic sales were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially as growth in Aerospace was more than offset by lower sales to energy and industrial end markets.
Operating profit of $588 million was down 2% from the prior-year period, excluding currency, as higher pricing increased operating profit but was impacted by lower volumes. Sequentially, operating profit grew 4%, excluding currency, in line with sales. Operating margin was 22.1% and the EBITDA margin was 33.0%. Excluding foreign currency, earnings per share of $1.39 was comparable to the prior year quarter of $1.45. Through continued operational discipline, we generated strong operating cash flow of $706 million, which was 26% of sales. This funded capital expenditures of $357 million, about two-thirds of which was in North America given its greater share of projects in the backlog. In addition, the company paid $214 million of dividends.
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with the fully executed long-term customer supply contract, is currently $1.3 billion comprised of 17 projects. In South America during the second quarter, we added a project to the backlog serving a pulp and paper customer, and started the CSP project in northern Brazil, a joint venture between Vale and South Korean firms Dongkuk Steel and POSCO Steel exporting slabs to CSP's Korean partners.
Existing backlog projects will start up and contribute to growth during the remainder of 2016 through 2018, as shown on slide 12. North America has grown to reflect about 65% of the backlog, with more than $500 million of CapEx related to two projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast. New project bidding remained strongest on the U.S. Gulf Coast for various petrochemical opportunities in both atmospheric and process gases for customers taking advantage of lower feedstock costs and significant infrastructure in the region. Other secular new on-site opportunities include refinery customers globally and customer outsourcing of select captive plants where we can bring value to the customer through improved reliability and efficiency, typically located in emerging markets.
In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants too small for the backlog threshold currently total about $65 million in CapEx for almost 20 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. These projects are located in the Americas, Asia and Europe, serving a variety of customers, including waste water treatment, automotive, chemicals and refineries.
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance located on slide five.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
The third quarter guidance range is $1.35 to $1.42. The midpoint of this range is roughly flat with the second quarter of this year. This guidance anticipates foreign exchange rates for Q3 to be consistent with Q2, so no sequential impact. We are expecting the benefits from recent acquisitions and project start-ups will be mostly offset by seasonally lower volumes. Aside from these effects, we're essentially assuming Q3 is a repeat of Q2.
For the full year guidance, we have held the midpoint and narrowed both the top and bottom by $0.10 for a new range of $5.45 to h $5.60. We believe it's appropriate and prudent to remain cautious in our earnings outlook. While some market trends and foreign exchange rates have stabilized, manufacturing growth rates are still fairly anemic in certain geographies, especially the Americas. We are diligently working to improve upon these numbers, but there are not enough positive signs to raise the midpoint at this time.
Capital expenditures are anticipated to be about $1.4 billion for the year. The current trend in backlog of projects would result in a lower number, but we need to account for potential new projects that could be signed this year.
In summary, we've had another solid quarter that was slightly better than prior expectations. Volumes and macroeconomic treads are starting to stabilize and should lap more difficult comps for the back half of this year. We've been executing well on the strategy and prudently deploying capital for growth. However, based on the current outlook, we aren't in a position to declare any type of recovery. Therefore, expectations going forward are for a continuation of existing trends coupled with normal seasonality and contribution from acquisitions and project start-ups.
But no matter what ultimately happens in the economy, I'm confident our employees around the world will manage what they can to continuously improve the company and create value. I'd now like to hand the call over for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Michael Schnell - Jefferies LLC
Hi, this is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Can you talk about long-term growth expectations in hydrogen? Has it decelerated to low double digits? And do you expect it to accelerate or decelerate going forward? And should we expect investment in new pipeline areas to be considered by the industry?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So to start on current trends, as you may have noticed, our sequential energy globally was up 7%. And that was entirely driven by North America, and it would be downstream refining primarily. That's hydrogen that's going in for both desulfurization and some of the large hydro-cracker units along the Gulf Coast. So, clearly, we've seen significant step-ups as we anticipated coming off a turnaround season in Q1. So current trends in our existing hydrogen assets are quite strong and quite good.
In addition, as you probably know, our current backlog has a pretty large project, in fact, the largest project in our company history with the Yara-BASF ammonia synthesis plant. And there, we're also leveraging our hydrogen network and expanding that to serve hydrogen into ammonia production. So we're not only seeing good strong trends on hydrogen refining, but also throughout the petrochemical space.
And when I look at our current backlog opportunities and future backlog opportunities, a lot of them do evolve around opportunities in syngas and hydrogen and also CO. You may recall we announced a project about a quarter or two ago around expanding our CO production in Louisiana, and that's primarily for MDI, TDI production. We're seeing not just the hydrogen molecules themselves but also some of the byproducts and co-products like CO that continue to be in pretty high demand in the U.S. Gulf as you continue to see the pet-chem chain buildout. So we feel pretty good about it.
And in addition, globally you're seeing more interest in processing heavy crudes. Now a lot of it is with some of the state-owned enterprises that fiscally probably have some issues they got to get their house in order before they'll be making investments, but the economics are there, and the interest is still there. And so that's another area for opportunity. So we feel very good about not just hydrogen but process gases in general and the growth prospects that are there.

Thank you. And our next question will come from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Perfect. Thank you. Can you just give a little more color on your outlook for manufacturing? Did anything materially shift throughout the quarter, even on a regional basis within the U.S.? Or were trends deteriorating on a sequential basis? Just anything on there would be appreciated. Thanks.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So first I'd say, what happened in this quarter was as we expected and anticipated. And the manufacturing, as I mentioned, was fairly weak in North America, and U.S. specifically. So looking at that, I still think there's a few more quarters we'll have to get through and that's most apparent in our packaged gas business. When I look inside of the second quarter, I'd say things were a little bit better in June than they were in the prior two months. When I look sequential from Q1 to Q2, roughly flat. I'd say hard goods probably a little worse. Our gas is a little better. But right now we're expecting the trends in Q2 to kind of continue into Q3. We'll see where that ends up.
But a lot of it is just I think just commodity keeps working its way through and on top of the strong dollar. Our packaged gas business, and a lot of the manufacturing base in the U.S., has a pretty deep supply chain, and I think they're getting a delayed effect from a lot of these headwinds that we saw call it a year ago in our more upstream customers in on-site and even merchant.
So I think there's going be a few more quarters at least. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you look at the sub IP categories like met fab and equipment, which tend to be big components of what you see in the packaged gas business, and those are still fairly weak, down more than 3% from the second quarter year-over-year. So I think there'll be a couple more quarters we'll have to work through on that.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's great detail. And, also, you've seen some mixed data out of Europe, but your results have hung in fairly well on a relative basis and obviously you've had some benefits from new projects in Russia and The Netherlands. Can you comment on a couple key trends you're look there as well which we should monitor in the region on a go-forward basis, and kind of more of an emphasis probably on the longer term here as well? Thank you.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, so I can speak to us specifically how we see this going out. So the back half of this year, we've got a couple more smaller project start-ups that will contribute. In addition, we'll get the full effect of the acquisitions that we just made. Now that will bring with it a lot of fixed costs, and that's part of the synergies that we'll have to work through. So that's something that, on a margin basis, will be probably a little diluted, and we saw it this quarter; but that's something that'll give us some opportunity going out.
What we're seeing today, pretty consistent with what we saw the last few quarters, are southern Europe, still doing quite well. We're seeing nice recovery in Spain; even Italy has been doing better. A lot of those for us are some packaged gas and merchant customers. In addition, we have a pretty large healthcare business in both of those countries that continues to do quite well. We have a large food business as well that's doing well.
When I look to northern Europe, it's a little different. I think Port of Antwerp has been strong, even beyond our most recent start-ups. And that's just a lot of that naphtha-based chemistry and the euro at $1.10 is just making it more competitive. So we've seen good volumes there and some good assets being operated.
Russia, the start-ups have helped. What we're seeing on the ground there is still fairly weak. You have high inflation. You have some weak growth rates. But we are able to get some pricing. But the on-site business has been still quite good, and they're running quite hard as our customers are global exporters, and with the ruble where it's at, they're very competitive. And we have some pipelines also in northern Europe that are running quite well in places like Germany.
So the real weak part I'd say continues to be anything energy related. So we have an upstream energy business from the North Sea that's still very weak. The Scandinavian economy is a little weaker given its dependence on oil. But for the most part, Europe has continued to steadily improve quarter after quarter for us.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's great. Thank you very much.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President

Thank you. And our next question will come from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, Matt; hey, Kelcey. Nice quarter.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
When I take a look at that global end market trend chart you have, I think it's the first time you've had more pluses than minuses, so that's good. Anything in particular that you're seeing potential for recovery? Again, I know you're not willing to say that we're on the right path yet, but any particular areas that is encouraging?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Mike, I think when I look at this, and probably starting with the year-over-year way to look at it, a couple things that â how I perceive it. I think first is that this demonstrates that we're executing well on our strategy. You look at the more consumer defensive industries of food, healthcare and some of the consumer areas like electronics, we're getting good mid- to high-single-digit growth. And remember, this excludes acquisitions. So we've been doing small roll-up acquisitions, and a lot of them have been in these areas â healthcare, some food. So they're adding even more on top of it. But that, in my mind, shows our ability to execute on what we've said.
I think another are metals. Metals is something that's been a challenge for us, yet you never saw our metals really drop the level you'd seen some of the underlying volumes of customers. Part of that is that we're tied to the most competitive producers in the world. Our contracts are quite strong and I think that's helped us a lot in that arena.
So that's an area that we've seen some positive lift and hopefully that's a trend that can continue. You know, manufacturing continues to be the tough one. Now energy is a two-tailed story, as you know. The upstream has been extremely weak and we'll be lapping that here in the back half. Downstream has been quite good, and so I expect that number to improve.
But manufacturing really is the challenge right now. And it tends to make sense as it's usually an end market that gets impacted later in cycles, and it tends to be a market that's heavily supplied by packaged gases. And when I look at the Americas, that's the area where we're seeing manufacturing still be fairly weak. In fact, the Americas are driving that whole drop. But we're seeing pretty much a slight growth in other regions.
So that's the one that in my mind â start to see that trend turn around and we can really start seeing some good positive growth rates. Now we're not anticipating that for the back half of this year. We're going to take some additional self-help actions to improve our results, but if we can get any traction on that, that should be quite helpful for us.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. And then looking at the next slide, the strategy slide, you have a lot of bullets that could help optimize the business for 2017. How much growth in earnings does that provide you? Then when you think about leverage to volume, I guess let's hope volume comes back at some point, is the incremental margins even better than you've seen in the past if volumes come back in 2017?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, yeah, I'll start with first on 2017. I'm not in a position to give guidance on 2017, but I can just talk near term, how we perceive things right now. First, on the backlog, we should have one of our strongest contribution years in 2017 in quite a long time; something that's more consistent with what we've laid out, 3%, 4%, just given the way our backlog start-ups are laid out. So we feel pretty good about that. Also, we'll have the full year impact of the acquisitions that we've done. And in addition, we'll be further along in the synergies that we're undertaking. So I also feel pretty good about that. So as far as those bullet points there, that's something that will definitely be a tailwind for us into 2017.
As far as the volumes, any organic volume growth, especially merchant and on-site that's atmospheric, is quite accretive, as you can imagine. We already have the tanks there. We already have the contracts. We already have the trailers, the trucks to deliver it. So there's really no incremental costs other than the power to liquefy it and the distribution cost to get it there. When we have HyCO, HyCO naturally is a lower margin business just because such a substantial portion of HyCO is energy pass-through. While that grows it's very strong to our cash flows and you saw it in the sequential here. Our operating cash flow's up almost 30%. But it is a little dilutive to margins just because of that energy component. So it's still very good growth for us, but that's an area where it might be a little dilutive.
But other than that, any incremental volume will be accretive. Project volume usually comes at about our average margins because you bring on depreciation. You need to bring on the costs of operators and property taxes and things like that. But any other incremental volume, yes, pretty accretive and should help us lift that number.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks, and good morning. Just a question, I'm on that slide 13 as well and noting food and beverage very strong year-over-year and sequentially, and 8%'s a big number for that. What do you think is causing you or allowing you to grow to that extent? I see Coke and some of the other consumer companies aren't putting out those types of volume numbers. So just wondering what it is. Then as an aside to that, can you talk a little bit about how the Rio Olympics are going play into this sub segment of your sales if they haven't already?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. Just starting on the trend, well, first, seasonally, it tends be stronger, as you can imagine, in the Northern Hemisphere as you start to get into slightly warmer climates. So there are some seasonal impact in North America, and that's normal. We tend to see that. But to your point, this growth rate is stronger than even more seasonality. And it's a couple things.
First, when you look at our business like new CO2 it's more based on installations not as much consumption of carbonated beverages. So as long as there's more restaurants, there's more quick serve fill areas for people that want to provide carbonated beverages, that will grow the sales in that business regardless often of how much they consume.
Food also is something that really is growing for us quite well. Part of it is just the trend of more convenience foods as you get things like dual income families, et cetera. We're seeing very strong growth in aquaculture, as you're getting more consumption of seafood. Food safety continues to be quite strong where we're seeing a lot of applications and opportunities. So part of this is application driven. Part are just demographics and trends. There is a little seasonality. But this is just, in my mind, demonstrates the focus we've put and the effort we're putting on it.
Rio, what you tend to find in Olympics and, as you know, first of all, Olympics are very concentrated in the city of Rio. So it's not like the World Cup where you were spread across all of Brazil. This is very focused just in Rio. What you tend to see sometimes are you'll see large production in beverages early on. And then it will sort of tone down right before the Olympic events. And we saw that, if you look at some of the large carbonated beverage producers in the area. I don't expect it to have a big impact. Maybe slightly negative, just given things will slow down for a few weeks. But overall, I don't expect it to be that material during the Games themselves, but we'll have to see.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Then just as a follow-up, in this presidential election season, there's a lot of conversation about different types of trade policies and a lot of back and forth on that. Obviously, not for you directly but for customers in some of your end markets, are you hearing or feeling any levels of concern from anyone in regards to not knowing who's going to win but just that there could be some meaningful changes to the U.S.'s trade position or things like TPP and stuff like that?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, there's probably general concern of who's running. But honestly, I don't know. I mean, there is chatter of isolationism, but to your point, from our specific industry, we source and sell in the same locale. So from that perspective, it really won't impact us all that much. I can't speak for our customer base; I really don't know, and there's nothing clear out there of what change could be, so it's hard to answer that.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks very much.

Thank you. And our next question will come from Mike Harrison from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Was wondering, speaking of trade policies, was wondering, Matt, if you could walk through what you're seeing in terms of the steel tariffs and how that's playing out on your metals business as you look out across the four regions. And do you expect any changes to what you're seeing in Q2 as you look out into the second half and into 2017?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay. Let me kind of reverse the order. As far as second half, we're not projecting any real change from the second quarter. So we're assuming second quarter trends, aside from seasonality, just sort of play out as they've been. So that's how our outlook is based.
But when I look at the tariff impact, and start with specifically U.S., clearly it's had a positive impact for U.S. producers of steel. You've seen the impact in the margins. You've seen inventories get a little tighter. And you've seen the production rates improve. So that's leveled the playing field and it's made it a bit more fair, if you want to say, for U.S.-based producers to compete. And I think that's been a good thing, and it's been a positive impact us to as well as a supplier into that industry. I believe it's â while it's hard to know for certain, I believe the loser in that equation will be mostly Chinese steel, and I think a lot of the call it Tier 2, Tier 3 producers. So we don't supply them in China today. So we haven't seen the offset to that benefit. It's not something that's in our customer base. So that's been a net positive for us.
You look at a country like India, they have very, very strict controls and import restrictions; so that's been pretty insulated and the growth rates there have been much more a function of what's going on in the country rather than what's going on around it or outside of it. So that's been good, and we've seen continued improvements there. Europe is now obviously in a position to really start looking for some protectionism. And again, I don't see that as a harm for our current customer base.
So we'll have to see. Net-net as I look across the impact, it's been net positive for us. And we'll just have to see if ultimately this results in capacity to be taken out in the world. And if that happens, that would be even more incrementally positive for us because that would likely help the merchant markets in those areas since a lot of these captive steel mills produce their own merchant liquid.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. Great. Then the other question I had is on the strength you're seeing in the U.S. Gulf Coast bidding activity and you mentioned your pipeline expansion there. Is it fair to assume that those projects in that area where you have a pipeline bring above-average returns as you leverage that pipeline network? And can you maybe update us on how your pipeline network is positioned relative to those of your competitors? Thank you.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So I'll start it off with saying bid activity is quite good. There are a lot of opportunities. They do take time, as we've said. They're quite large and integrated. So that adds to the amount of time that they take to execute, but we still feel quite good about it and the opportunity set that that provides.
Clearly, having the asset base there gives you an advantage because you can deliver the reliability. Remember, you need to be reliable to that customer every day, every minute of every day. This is large on-site quantities that are 24/7. So being able to give the confidence that you won't shut them down is what they're really looking for; and then on top of that, you've got to provide it cost effectively. So clearly, we're going to leverage our asset base the best that we can to ensure the reliability and be able to get a respectable return.
And when you win these projects, sometimes you're building production capacity. Sometimes you're building distribution capacity, which would mean more pipes and more compressors. So clearly, if we have an opportunity to expand our distribution through getting an attractive return, we always want to be able to take that. Because that not only gives us a good project, but it gives us a platform to work off for new future opportunities as well. And so we're doing a combination of all the above. We're leveraging our asset base; we're extending our asset base, and the more opportunities we can add onto this, the more reliability we can bring in quality product for our customers.
So that's how we look at it, and that's how we approach it. As far as infrastructure, we have got a significant both hydrogen process gas and atmospheric infrastructure throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Texas as well as Louisiana. And in my opinion, it's pretty unrivaled. We have a very large operating hydrogen storage cavern, which is a very good asset to have to ensure reliability at instantaneous needs for our customers. So it's been a great asset for us to try and win more business, and we continue to see good opportunities there.

Thank you. And our next question will come from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hello, guys, this is Chris Evans on for Bob. Matt, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your leverage, maybe put it in context of what your ultimate goal would be there. And talk about maybe how your leverage and maybe deleveraging might impact your uses of cash going forward.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So leverage as debt, right, not operating leverage is what you want to talk about?
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Correct.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So, when I look at my net debt position, we increased, as I mentioned, about $200 million this quarter and that was not a surprise. We expected that due to about $360 million of that being acquisitions. So had I not done the acquisitions, I would have been able to lower net debt a bit. But, at a minimum, I want to reduce this $200 million that just raised. We'll probably spend the next one to two quarters lowering net debt a bit, but we'll not allow dilution to happen.
I don't expect any more large acquisitions at this point, so it should be more normal run rate. And then once we get debt back down to kind of flatline level, we'll be in a position to re-evaluate for things like either more buybacks or whatever opportunity sets there are. But I'll have to re-evaluate that with our CapEx outlook and other uses of cash.
So right now, probably more debt pay-down next two quarters and then we'll re-evaluate in 2017 based on where things are.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Is it fair to assume some level of share repurchase will resume in 2017?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, absolutely we'll have some share repurchase in 2017. We're not going to allow dilution to happen. And then it's just a matter of how much accretion we get. I do expect we'll be back doing some of that â just won't have a number out there until we start laying out our projections for 2017.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. And you just mentioned in your prepared remarks a bunch of different opportunities for costs. Could you talk through those specifically and maybe how much they might contribute?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So we're always constantly looking to align our cost structure with the outlook we see in the markets we serve. And it obviously is a very, very localized business that we run. So we can do that in many pockets around the world, and we continuously do that. And right now there are some challenged ends markets and some challenged geographies when we look out the next few quarters.
So we're going to probably step up a little bit of our actions and what we're doing, and it's multiple self-help actions. It's going be costs. Clearly, we've done some price actions here recently, and we're just going to have to continue to take some steps. I don't expect any large type event, but it's just part of what we do to try and improve or enhance our margins when we're facing some challenging times.

Thank you. And our next question will come from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah good morning, guys.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Just wanted to go to the margin in the North American section, if we could. Down a little over half a percent year on year, and if you just look through the volume price pass-through, you wouldn't have thought that. So I was wondering, is there a mix happening in there, maybe around the JVs or something like that, that's causing the margin number to come down?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, Duffy, there's definitely some mix in there. We had a lot of stronger HyCO volumes and, as I mentioned, they tend to be lower margin simply because there's so much energy that's passed through. So while we show a pass-through change in pass-through price, which is separate, there is just the fact that there is a big portion of what you're selling in HyCO is energy. So they tend to be lower operating margins. When you sell more, you get a little bit negative mix.
The lower packaged gas also does hurt a bit, and that's because it tends to be variable margin you lose, and the SG&A is fixed cost, but those are things that we're working on. That's why I feel we'll have that improved by Q4. And other than that, year-over-year you've got the energy that we've talked about. That was higher margin business that's almost completely disappeared. And that's been a pretty big headwind to margins for all of North America that we've had to manage through. So those have been sort of the main contributing factors. But I do expect going forward we're still going to expand our margins. And that's something we're working to improve here in the out quarters.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then if we just go to the midpoint of the guidance, is it fair to assume kind of from last quarter to this quarter, we've had about $0.10 to $0.15 of improvement from FX and $0.10 to $0.15 of falloff just from the base business, is that the right way to think through it?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
You're talking about sequential Q1 to Q2?
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Well, if I just look at your guidance from Q1 where the midpoint was the same as your current guidance, you had a different FX implied number in there. So if I just kind of do the numbers, the FX is improved maybe $0.10 or $0.15 in your go forward and the base business has fallen off about that much, is that the right way to think about it?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Here's probably the best way to think about it. I understand what you're doing and I see the $0.10. I get that. I would probably say â this is probably the easiest way to think about it, Q2 right now has reflected which are pretty much the average rates we're seeing today, and that's our expectation going forward for Q3 and Q4. So on a sequential basis, we're not expecting much more FX impact based on where we were at Q2. Obviously, that's a benefit from Q1, and that's a benefit from where we started our guidance range in the beginning of this year. But what we are saying is that we're not expecting organic volumes to change all that much for the remainder of the year. If they're better, we'll do better. If they're worse, we're going to continue to take actions to mitigate that.
That's the basic outlook of how we're doing it, and that's how I would envision it. But at this point, I would say the current sort of FX rates, the average rates of Q2, are what our assumption is for the remainder of the year.

Thank you and our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yes, hi. Good morning.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
You mentioned about metals improving. Any improvement you're seeing is steel given the tariffs or barriers that have been put up by different countries? And then what's the utilization rate on your oxygen pipeline for the steel industry?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
All right. Well, first, we don't provide utilization on pipeline. So that's not a number we give out. But I did earlier kind of answer the impact on steel tariffs around the world, P.J., but I can just repeat it real quick. But from a U.S. perspective, it has helped. You've seen margins on hotroll coil improve, and thus you've seen production rates improve. And it's helped level the playing field. So that's been a positive impact, and we'll see what it is going forward. But our assumption is for Q2 kind of steel volumes to roughly be flat for the remainder of the year.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Thank you. And you talked about your project backlog and some projects coming out by end of this year, potentially could be adding some projects including U.S. Gulf Coast. So with all that, where do you think your CapEx will trend in 2017 and 2018? Thank you.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay. So we'll give more clear CapEx guidance in January for 2017. But I can say this much around the backlog, if we sign nothing new for the remainder of the year, the backlog will drop down to about $1 billion. And of that $1 billion, I would anticipate you'd have two-thirds or so that would be spent in 2017 and the remainder would be spent in 2018. So the question of â and then we tend to have normally a certain amount of non-large growth CapEx, that usually is about 20%, 25% of our CapEx spend.
All new projects we sign from here on out, we would anticipate roughly 20% to 30% of that spend would be in year one. Year one of from when you sign it. So that's how you could sort of model CapEx going out, but at this point it's hard to gauge where a number would be without factoring in new project wins.

And our last question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Just wanted to follow up on PDI. You talked about how volumes were negative because of the macros, but how negative were they? And were gasses and rent flat, was the decline all in hard goods? Maybe just finally comment on what margin impact this lower volume had on PDI?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So gas and rent are down low single digits, although by June it's kind of stabilized on a year-over-year basis, same-store sale. Hard goods still down kind of double digit. And that's just a function of both the industries that you see are hard good intensive whether it's heavy equipment, ag, oil and gas, and also just the general manufacturing environment. So those are kind of the numbers for PDI that we saw roughly in the second quarter. And I'd say, like I said on sequential basis, hard goods has been a little better Q1 to Q2 but not much. And gas has gotten a little better. So we'll have to see how it plays out in Q3. But those have been sort of the same-store sale trends that we saw.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Then how about on the margin impact given that hard goods is falling more? Has it had less of a margin impact and have you been able to get ahead by cutting costs?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, there's going be a less of a margin impact on hard goods obviously than gas, given they tend to be more distributor type margins than producer margins. But they still create variable margin, right. So, yes, we need to do some actions to help mitigate some of that, which we are. We've also had some price actions that have helped mitigate some of it. But this is not that inconsistent the trends we've seen from kind of the manufacturing curtailment you saw in 2009. Now it's not as severe as what we saw in 2009, but the pattern is fairly similar.
So, yeah, what we did back then was same thing. We had some cost actions. We had price actions where we could. Gas did not drop near as much as hard goods. Rent hung in for the most part, and then you just managed through it and then you start to see some form of recovery in the back end. That's why we're saying at this point could be a couple more quarters. We're not sure, but we'll have to see.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
