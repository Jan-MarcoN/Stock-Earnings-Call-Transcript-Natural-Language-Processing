Bernard Wang
Thank you, Operator. On behalf of Linde, we would like to thank you for joining our results presentation for the first nine months of 2016 financial year. I am pleased to be joined today by Dr. Wolfgang Buechele, our CEO, Dr. Sven Schneider, our CFO, and Bernd Eulitz, member of the Executive Board responsible for the EMEA segment.
Let me walk you through today's agenda on Slide 3. Dr. Buechele will open the presentation with a discussion of our strategic plan. Dr. Schneider will then go into more depth on the operational performance in the first nine months of 2016 and conclude with the outlook. Afterward, Dr. Buechele will close with a brief summary and then we will open the line for your questions. Let me now hand you over to Dr. Buechele.
Wolfgang Buechele
Thank you very much, Bernard. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and a warm welcome from my side too. Before continuing, I would like to briefly make some comments about recent developments here at Linde. As you are well aware, during the quarter we confirmed that we were engaged with Praxair in preliminary talks regarding a potential merger of equals. In September we decided to terminate these talks. Those are the facts, and they are now part of history. What is also a fact, is that Linde is a strong company with top employees, that is well positioned, both in terms of geography and products and is appreciated as a highly valued business partner by our global customer base. At the same time, we are under constant pressure to manage costs and structures in this challenging environment of global competition.
The merger would have been one strategic option to meet these challenges. However, and let me be very clear in this respect, it is not our only strategic option. Over the next few slides, I will outline our strategic plan for moving forward, lifting our performance, and becoming even stronger.
Now moving to Slide 4, strategic plan. Our strategic plan has three objectives, lifting our operating profit margin, lifting our return on capital employed, and lifting shareholder value. To achieve this, we have defined individual themes, the first being performance focus. As I mentioned earlier, we are constantly challenged to manage our costs and structures. To address this we are preparing to take stringent measures to manage costs, as well as to optimize our portfolio to improve our operating and financial performance. Our second theme is quality growth. As we all know, today's environment of slower macroeconomic development and global competition poses difficult headwinds to growth. This makes it all the more important that we focus on leveraging our competitive strengths and maintain a sound balance sheet. Doing so will put us in a strong position to selectively exploit attractive growth opportunities that support accretion to margins and returns. Last, but certainly not least, the third theme is value creation, with the objective of lifting shareholder value. To this end, we plan a further increase in our dividend for this year. This allows shareholders to better participate in our solid business model and improve performance going forward.
On Slide 5, you can see the details regarding our plans to generate savings through cost management. Many of you are aware of our Focus program and the approximately â¬180 million of net cost savings we expect to deliver by the end of 2017. On top of Focus, we intend to realize additional cost savings of around â¬370 million by the end of 2019 as part of our new Lift program. In addition to generating savings from restructuring in various geographies, this will also drive savings from further organizational streamlining as well as from non-personnel related cost reductions. Please note, that restructuring cost related to Lift of around â¬400 million are expected to be accounted for as non-recurring items in this and next year. In parallel, we are continuing to pursue continuous efficiency improvement measures. Our HP0 II program is expected to deliver around â¬820 million of gross cost savings by its conclusion at the end of 2016. As part of our learning organization concept, we certainly will continue striving to improve our efficiency in 2017 and beyond.
Let us now move to Slide number 6. In addition to cost savings, we intend to lift margins and returns through portfolio optimization. To achieve this, the Executive Board has tasked itself to conduct in-depth strategic reviews of our portfolio to ensure that our business segments have the right scale and scope to deliver stronger divisional and group margins. In the gases division, measures will focus on streamlining our global footprint and product area presence. For the engineering division, the emphasis will be on optimizing capacity and achieving efficiency gains. In the remainder of the Linde Group, we will continue evaluating investment opportunities of non-core activity.
I would now like to proceed to Slide number 7, and our second theme, quality growth. We continue to believe that the current global economic environment still offers us many opportunities for growth. However, we are not out to pursue growth for growth's sake. What we seek is quality growth that builds value as measured by higher operating profit margins and return on capital employed. Our strategy to deliver quality growth involves two aspects. The first is a clear focus on areas where we believe quality growth opportunities exist. This can be more mature -- our core mature markets where we hold strong positions, fast growing Asian markets with strong demand for tailored applications, and in the U.S. homecare market where Lincare is the clear leader. The second aspect is that we are clearly able to leverage our key competitive strengths in these specific focus areas. These strengths include using our established presence around the world to capture attractive onsite opportunities, technological capabilities in applications, and digitalization, financial capabilities to conduct bolt-on M&A and decaptivations as an additional growth stimulus, as well as synergies between gases and engineering. Through this approach, we aim to capture quality growth that is accretive to both margins and returns.
Let me continue now to Slide number 8 and the outlook for the CapEx to sales ratio in our gases division. Though we believe material quality growth opportunities are still available to us, we are confident that the volume of capital expenditures needed to capture this growth will be lower than in the past. Given this, we are lowering our expected mid-term CapEx to sales ratio for the gases division from 13% to a range between 11% and 12%. The reduced capital investment level will be supportive of both free cash generation as well as our return on capital employed. Proceeding now to our financial position, we move to slide number nine. As can be seen on the chart on the left, the trend of strong operating cash flow development has continued into the first nine months of this year in spite of recent currency headwinds. This is a testament to the resilience of our business model and of our disciplined management of working capital. The strength of our cash generation is also visible in the graph on the right. Despite successfully higher dividend payments, our net debt to operating profit ratio has further declined to 1.8 times as of the end of September. This remains well within our target of keeping this ratio below 2.5 times as part of our commitment to maintain a strong investment grade rating.
Let me close with a remark on our dividend on Slide 10. In expectation of continued solid operating profit and operating cash flow, as well as lower investment levels in the medium term, Linde plans a further increase of the dividend for 2016. We also remain committed to our long term approach of a stable and growing -- or growing dividend every year.
With this I would conclude for the time being and hand over to Sven Schneider. Sven, please.
Sven Schneider
Thank you Wolfgang and good afternoon everyone. Let me begin with highlights of our performance in the first nine months of 2016 on Slide 12. Reported Group revenue declined year-over-year by 4.3%, just under â¬13 billion, due to currency headwinds and the expected lower contributions from engineering. Adjusted for currency, the decline in revenue was 1.1%. Reported Group operating profit declined by 2.3% to â¬3.07 billion. After adjusting for FX, operating profit increased by 0.8%. The revenue and operating profit figures resulted in a group margin of 23.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than the year ago period. This was supported on margin improvement in the gases division and a stable margin in engineering. Despite currency headwinds, operating cash flow for the period was solid at â¬2.5 billion which is 4.7% higher than last year's level. Reported EPS came in at â¬5.09, nearly 10% above the level of last year.
Now I would like to move onto the development of revenue and operating profit by division on Slide number 13. Revenue in the gases division declined by 3.2% to around â¬11 billion as currency and pass-through effects, including natural gas prices, remain headwinds. Revenue in the engineering division proceeded in line with expectations, totaling â¬1.7 billion. Operating profit in the gases division remained stable at â¬3.1 billion. The margin improvement to 28.1% was supported by positive effects for restructuring measures as well as by lower prices for natural gas. In the engineering division, the margin was 8.4%, which is the same level as last year and in line with our guidance.
Let us continue with a more detailed review of the performance in the gases division on the next Slide 14. Though less than in the first half of the year, natural gas prices remained a headwind in the third quarter and amounted to minus 0.6% in the nine month reporting period. In spite of the weakening of the pound sterling due to the Brexit referendum, overall currency headwinds also diminished in the quarter but remain materially negative at minus 3.4% versus the year ago period. Comparable growth in the period was 0.8%.
I will now go into more detail about comparable growth starting with the product area perspective on Slide 15. In healthcare, comparable growth in the nine month period was 5%. The development was driven by the American HomePatient acquisition, however, growth was restrained by competitive bidding as the third quarter was the first period in which the full impact became visible. Growth was also held back by the divestment of Specialty Pharma, which became deconsolidated near the end of August, therefore, the full quarterly effect of the divestment will be visible in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects from American HomePatient's competitive bidding and Specialty Pharma, healthcare growth in the period would have reflected solid underlying volume trends. Growth in On-site came in at plus 0.5% versus the prior year. Please note that this figure is not adjusted for electricity and other negative pass-through effects. Growth in the third quarter of 3.2% was supported by On-site in South East Asia. Also as you may remember, turnarounds in Q3 2015 provided for a lower comparable base. Lastly, for the year-over-year effect of the end of the contract in Australia concluded in the second quarter, the insolvency of a customer in the UK remained a headwind in the third quarter. After adjusting for the last two mentioned effects, On-site growth for the reporting period would have been 2.2%. Bulk revenues increased 0.2% on a comparable basis, with Asia providing the highest growth contribution. In the cylinder gas business, reported revenue was â¬2.9 billion, which is 2.1% below the comparable figure for the first nine months of 2015. The still negative development in the South Pacific remains a significant headwind. Additionally, the Specialty Gas development that peaked in the third quarter last year has now returned to normal levels, thus providing a higher comparable base for the growth comparison. This effect is specifically due to the pricing for neon.
I would now like to move on to revenue by operating segment on Slide 16. Revenue in EMEA declined by 0.8% on a comparable basis. Growth remains impacted by headwinds for weakness in the UK steel sector, including the insolvency of a customer, as mentioned previously, and the challenging macro environment in South Africa. The highest growth contribution came from the region Middle East and Eastern Europe, from a product area perspective the strongest growth in EMEA came from healthcare. In Asia Pacific, growth was 1.1% on a comparable basis. Comparable growth in Asia remained solid throughout the year at 5.1%. In contrast, developments in the South Pacific, so mostly Australia, continued to be significantly negative due to the weak economic conditions and the end of a contract in 2015. Expanded efficiency measures have already been initiated to address the challenging situation. In terms of product areas within Asia Pacific, on-site and bulk shows the highest growth. Comparable growth in the Americas was 2.2% in the reporting period. The acquisition of American HomePatient in addition to pricing in South America contributed to growth. However, revenue was impacted by the divestment of Specialty Pharma, Specialty Gases and competitive bidding.
Now let's move over to the profit by operating segment on Slide 17. As a reminder, Gases margin improved year-over-year from 27.5% to 28.1%. Therein, operating profit in EMEA increased slightly by 0.6% and operating margin expanded to 31.8%. Likewise, operating margin in APAC also improved by 50 basis points to 26.2%. The margin improvement in both segments was aided by lower natural gas prices, and cost savings from efficiency measures. On the other hand, operating margin in the Americas decreased by 60 basis points versus the same period last year due to effects including the communicated further price reductions from competitive bidding, as well as the headwind from Specialty Gases.
Let us now take a look at the engineering division's performance on Slide 18. Engineering revenue developed in line with project progress, totaling â¬1.7 billion. The realized margin of 8.4% is in line with our 2016 outlook of around 8%. At â¬1.6 billion, order intake has significantly improved from the year ago period. The improvement includes an order from Gazprom for the second phase of their AMUR gas processing plant project in the third quarter. With the improved order intake, order backlog remains solid at â¬4.3 billion.
This concludes the divisional performance review; please flip to the outlook on Slide 19. We hereby confirm our outlook for 2016. We also confirm our medium term outlook of group operating profit of â¬4.2 billion to â¬4.5 billion and a return on capital employed of 9% to 10% in 2017. Please note that the medium term outlook is based on forward exchange rates from the time of communication in November 2015. With this let me return you to Wolfgang.
Wolfgang Buechele
Thank you very much Sven. I would like to close our presentation for today with Slide number 20. As Sven just outlined, we faced multiple headwinds in the third quarter that has had an impact on our growth development. However, as clearly visible in the numbers, is a resilience of our business model and our strong cash flow generation. Furthermore, we had multiple notable achievements in the quarter, such as the awarding of a large on-site project in Malaysia with Petronas, a bolt-on acquisition that will enhance our density in East Asia, and an additional sizeable order intake, as you just have heard from Sven, which came from Gazprom for engineering. We remain on track to fulfill our outlooks for 2016 and 2017. We also outlined the new --our new strategic plan going forward, which includes measures for cost management, portfolio optimization, quality growth, and ongoing sound financial precision and a planned further increase in our dividend for 2016. With these measures, we are confident that we will be able to further lift our operating profit margin, our return on capital employed and shareholder value.
Thank you for your attention and interest in Linde. We are very happy to take your questions now. Operator, you may now poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jean-Francois Meymandi, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Jean-Francois Meymandi
Good afternoon, two or three questions on my side. The first one is -- sorry, and first I am going to go on that, on Praxair. The company was saying yesterday on their conference call that they would be open to resume talks with you, what would be your stance on that? Are you still open to further discussions or is it a closed matter for you? The second one is on the cost cutting. There were a multiple amount of cost cutting exercises within Linde in the past years with mitigate -- let's say some plus and minuses regarding the retention, what is the target retention rate on your further cost savings of â¬320 million and how did you approach the cost savings? Was is really bottom up or top down given you had to be quite quick in that process? The third one, if I look on slide 6, you are saying that you want a streamlined portfolio, streamlined global footprint, would that mean that you are ready to sell completely some locations without doing asset swaps like you communicated in the past?
Wolfgang Buechele
Thank you JF, let me start I think regarding the situation with Praxair. We have communicated on 12th of September that from our side the negotiations have been terminated and from that point of view there is nothing else which I can add and would like to add to this topic. When it comes to the cost cutting, in a company like ours, you are never only working in one direction. That is why we always work on multiple options and, therefore, besides pursuing the negotiations with Praxair we also have, of course, at all times worked on other options what we could do, what we have to do, in a volatile environment as of today. Therefore, first of all, it is not â¬320 million it's â¬360 million and -- sorry â¬370 million.
Jean-Francois Meymandi
But you already announced â¬50 million with H1, right?
Wolfgang Buechele
Yes.
Jean-Francois Meymandi
So it's â¬320 million additional?
Wolfgang Buechele
Yes, if you want it that way you are correct but overall the Lift program -- because what you have with the â¬50 million was testing elements which we want to introduce already in certain countries. From the point of view -- as you can see, we have looked into what we want to do as part of the Lift program in parallel to negotiations with Praxair. From that point of view, we have a clear understanding how this net cost savings -- and this is important, it's net cost savings, how they will be brought to the table from the various organizational units and it is contribution by all organizational elements. So it's not limited to one geography or to functions versus business, it's really a contribution with clear discussions with the respective leadership teams who contributes what. When it comes to streamlining, we are, especially when it comes to smaller countries, meaning the seed countries, we are ready to sell. From that point of view, we have sold last year Samoa and Fiji and from that point of view are open now to also divest let's say countries where we either have a dilutive margin or we have a growth which is below our expectations, a growth opportunity, or we have political instability like in some countries in Africa. So we are willing to sell these as part of our streamlining effort.
Jean-Francois Meymandi
Would that be sizeable?
Wolfgang Buechele
Look I think I don't want to speculate at that time but as I said seed countries then typically these are not the biggest countries.
Operator
Thank you, the next question comes from Andreas Heine, Mainfirst. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Andreas Heine
Yes, I would like to come back to the cost cutting program as well. Are you able to split this already over the regions to give some indications on this and could you elaborate a little bit on how the phasing of the changes will be? Then on the operating performance in Q3, looking on the cylinders, which were particularly weak, you say all this impact from the neon gas, is there something else weakening as well? Looking on on-site, if I look on Q3 specially, as with the cylinders was also a Q3 number I was looking at. If you look at on the on-site business, if I calculated it right, the comparable growth came back to 3%. Is that now a clean number in this particular Q3 and a good guidance for the coming quarters? I would love to see more details on that one, please.
Sven Schneider
Let me start with the question on the split of the savings per regions. So please understand that we are not yet there to split numbers among regions or business units as we are just starting to discuss these initiatives also with the works representatives. Of course, it's fair to assume that globally there are different speeds, you have to be more aware of the so-called quotas [indiscernible] in parts of EMEA when in other regions you can move ahead quicker. But unfortunately that's all guidance we can give you at that moment in time. Coming to the phasing of the charges, so just to be very clear and you rightfully mentioned that already in the call there are â¬50 million, which have been now moved into the Lift program, which formerly have been with the Focus program. â¬39 million of the â¬50 million are from the first six months and â¬11 million of the â¬50 million are booked in Q3. We expect the â¬400 million one-timers which will occur in combination of the â¬370 million net cost savings to follow a logic of one third in this year and two thirds in next year. So if we run the numbers then another â¬50 million to â¬70 million may come this year and the rest will come in 2017, cash flow wise most of that will happen in 2017. Then to your question of the cylinder, there are two effects. The biggest one, is as you said, the neon effect. Then there is some volume related effect notably from our SP -- that's unfortunately -- sorry, Australia -- we call it South Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand, as this part of the world is still in a de-industrialization mode.
Andreas Heine
So the trends in Europe and the U.S. are then -- U.S. are not in but in Europe are then more flattish rather than falling.
Wolfgang Buechele
I think in Europe they are flattish except -- if I might just jump in very quickly. We see a certain uncertainty currently in the UK but after the Brexit vote the industry is currently a little bit in a wait and see mode, waiting when and how the government is finally triggering the negotiations according to Article 50.
Sven Schneider
To your last question regarding on-site, please recall the growth in Q3 2015 was affected by turnarounds, thus lowering the comparable base. Now as you have seen, we experienced good growth in on-site in South East Asia and the year-over-year effect of Bulva Island ended in Q2. But if you then look at Q4, this will be then flatter, given the elements I just mentioned.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Dan Rizzo
Hello, this is actually Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. As the size of large projects increases, is there any precedent for industrial gas companies to do single project JVs, or will the outcome be a lumpier backlog?
Wolfgang Buechele
If you talk about JVs, yes, there is of course a good reason. On the one hand, when it comes to, for example, the Petronas JV, that is something which is quite common also in China where for example we have a number of JVs with Sinopec for example but also with others. This is a large, a petrochemical facility, which Petronas is pursuing, and therefore, this is pretty common to then have a joint venture for these type of installations. We will show that -- we have shown that separately because for us this will be accounted for only once the plant goes on stream. Just that we are also clear when you do the modelling, you will not see that in the CapEx unless the plant is ready and is up on stream, then we will reclassify it and record it in our books; before it's basically in the financial results.
Dan Rizzo
Then are customers ratcheting up the balance sheet requirements if Linde wants to bid on mega projects?
Wolfgang Buechele
Look, I think we are looking for projects which are value creating and from that point of view we are bidding on mega projects if we deem that appropriate and if there is suitable project grounds. Clearly for the time being, in all fairness, there are not too many mega projects because as you might be aware also when it comes to call to acts in China over the last 18 months, no new project has been approved by NDRC.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Tyler, Redburn. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Neil Tyler
I'd to ask two questions please. Firstly, back to the savings program. You specifically talk about net savings on this occasion whereas previously they have been gross savings so I wonder if you can explain how you can confidently predict the net figure. Then secondly, could you help me understand a figure for the absolute sales contribution this quarter or nine months year-to-date, whichever is the easier, from start-up and ramp-up of new projects. So what that contribution has been so far in the third quarter figure.
Wolfgang Buechele
Let me take the first one and then refer to Sven for the second one. First of all, when we talk with HPO about efficiency programs we were talking in general about optimizations within the group, we were talking on procurement impacts, et cetera. These types of optimizations will continue as part of our learning organization. What we are considering now as part of Lift is to a large extent -- and that's why it is easy to be classified as net savings, it's personnel related and indirect personnel costs and the likes where we have a very clear let's say, put it that way, idea what we want to do and how we can do it. But please understand that I cannot be more specific at this point because obviously especially in Europe the negotiations with the works councils of the various countries have to be executed in due course. However, in other parts of the world, as you have also heard from Sven, we will move faster because some of the one-timers will be booked and they will come clearly from overseas, not from Europe. With this I would ask Sven to move to the second question regarding ramp-ups.
Sven Schneider
Thank you Wolfgang, yes, Neil to your question. When I have only at hand the big new projects, so it's a big size CapEx project, if you look here at the ramp-up of on-stream in 2016 and ramp-ups which have been started in 2015 but which materialize in 2016, then it's roughly a ball park revenue number of â¬70 million to â¬75 million.
Neil Tyler
That's year-to-date, correct, yes.
Sven Schneider
Yes.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Martin Roediger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Martin Roediger
Sorry, I have to come back to the Lift program to get a better understanding here. For theâ¦ 
Wolfgang Buechele
Sorry, we can't understand you, your line is broken.
Martin Roediger
Okay, I try to speak as slowly as possible. Regarding the cost savings program, for the Focus program you earmarked 258 million one-time costs and 180 million saving which is a savings ratio of 1.43. Your Lift program is expected to cost 400 million one-time costs and 370 million savings. So a cost to savings ration of 1.08. Why is the ratio for the second program that much better than the first program? You mentioned its more personnel related compared to the first program and more [at over 60], but I don't get really the real difference in that comparison. The second question is again on the sales failed merger talks with Praxair. You mentioned at that point in time governance issues as the reasons for this failure. Is there any chance that such issues can be solved in a second attempt for any -- for a merger talk? And finally a bit on the mid-term outlook. â¬120 million savings from your LIFT program will contribute already for the year 2017, so why do you keep your mid-term outlook unchanged for 2017?
Wolfgang Buechele
So we try to answer as good as we can and if we didn't get everything then please jump in again, because the line was very difficult to follow. When you look to the Focus program, the Focus program was 100% FTE related, whereas, obviously the LIFT program is definitely to a large extent FTE related. However, as I said, there are also secondary personnel-related costs in, which, when you embark on savings, do not trigger a one-time cost. And from that point of view the equation looks different than in the first case. Then the next question is Praxair. Again, the point is that we have on certain details, obviously, not been able to find and build a bridge where both companies could walk. I think from that point of view I cannot tell you at this point whether that can be bridged in the future or not. And from that point of view I would not like to speculate at this point what is going to happen, whether there will be additional discussions. At least for us, we have made very clear we discontinued the negotiations and from that point of view there is not more to be said.
Sven Schneider
And to the third question, again, if I got it right, you asked about the 2017 outlook, why are we not changing that. We are here to be really honest with you. There are a lot of factors which don't add to certainty in that world. You have this, what we call, tepid macroeconomic environment; we have geopolitical uncertainties, the Brexit question, elections in the U.S., and others. And on top of that we have the competitive bidding effect which continues. Of course, as we already said, we will make sure that with bolt-on -- selective bolt-on acquisitions and with efficiency measures, the margin of Lincare will go back and will go up, but still there is uncertainty. And these are the main reasons why we at this moment in time don't want to change the outlook for 2017.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Geoff Haire, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Geoff Haire
I just wanted to come to the CapEx guidance that you've given. My understanding is that your maintenance CapEx is around about 9% of gas sales, so you're spending somewhere between 2% to 3% in growth. I just wanted to ask how firm you have views of projects which you will be able to spend that additional growth CapEx on over the next five years? And is there the possibility to reduce that further?
Wolfgang Buechele
Let me take that question, because I'm a little bit surprised where you got your percentage figures from. We always guided that approximately one-sixth of our CapEx is maintenance CapEx and this is a totally different figure than what you just referred to. And then we have obviously certain amounts which we need for the healthcare business, we have certain amounts which we need in replacement et cetera for our gas distribution equipment and the rest is for growth. And from that point of view, there is definitely enough for growth in our budgets for the next years. Because factually, when you consider that we want to be more specific where we invest, we have clearly classified the countries where our priority for investment is you will see in the future, let's call it that way, a more focused investment policy, a more focused investment approach when it comes to geographical distribution. And from that point of view we are definitely -- we will be able, with the guided growth CapEx, to continue to grow within the given opportunities we see.
Sven Schneider
And if I may add, I think the 9% you're referring to for third quarter, they refer to the Group, whereas, our guidance of 11% to 12% refers to gases. Maybe that's the reason forâ¦
Geoff Haire
Okay.
Sven Schneider
â¦different number.
Wolfgang Buechele
And again, the maintenance CapEx, just to get that right, is approximately one-sixth of the overall CapEx figure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Thomas Wrigglesworth, Citi. Your line is now open, please go ahead.

Two questions, if I may. The first is I'd be interested on your opinion about any perceived margin gaps that exists between Linde and peers, as you see it. There's been a lot of commentary in the press about a potential margin gap, but I'd be very interested on your opinion, and especially how that relates to the magnitude and size of the restructuring that you've put in place and the scope for further restructuring in the future. And a second question, if I may. I think I'm getting the message today that it's a case of dividends over share buyback. Is that the correct reception of what you're trying to communicate, or are buybacks also on the cards with regards to the future of capital management?
Wolfgang Buechele
Let me take the first question regarding the margin. The margin obviously is also related to the portfolio. And, for example, when you look to the homecare portfolio, we have said before that Lincare is obviously in the range of the U.S. gases margin. Now, with competitive bidding three, you have seen -- and competitive two re-bid, you have seen that the gases margin in the third quarter declined. Obviously, there were two effects. The one is the competitive bidding and the other is the neon effect. And from that point of view, as long as you have a sizeable, for example, Lincare business you will not be able, structurally, to get to a 33% or 34%. The same holds true, for example, when you have LNG businesses, when you have LPG businesses, which we consider also valuable growth opportunities. So, therefore, you have always to consider the product mix relative to, basically, then the absolute margin. And from that point of view, I don't see that we -- and we are not intending -- and I've said that a couple of times before. We are not intending with our product mix -- we want to keep a stable and a broader portfolio in the one or other way than our peers have. And from that point of view we are not planning to shoot to 33% or shoot to 34%, but getting closer in the direction of 30% is clearly what we are heading for.
With respect to dividends and share buybacks I would like to hand over to Sven.
Sven Schneider
Yes. And if I may add one sentence to the question, I think the -- because you were also referring to the cost-cutting program here. Let's put it this way. The amount and the timing of our targeted net cost savings should give you comfort that we definitely aim to increase the margins. I think that is important to understand. Now moving into your share buyback related question, not a surprise that this question is asked. Let us be very open here. Up to the year 2015, we have excluded share buybacks according to our finance policy. In Q1, Q2 of this year for the first time we have stated that we are no longer excluding share buybacks, which is a different statement, as you have imagined. Now we can repeat that we are not excluding the possibility of a share buyback and we are evaluating all options, but no decision has been made yet.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Jeremy Redenius, Bernstein. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Jeremy Redenius
I have three. Firstly, on the -- looking forward, you used to give CapEx by on-stream date for new projects. I think the last figure we saw was about â¬300 million and a bit for 2017. Do you have any update to that? You'd mentioned one large project in Malaysia, but I'd like to try to look out to 2017 and 2018 please. And then secondly, and also on CapEx, I believe really the series of CapEx by on-stream date would be about â¬600 million for 2016. I recognize some of that was renewal of a PEMEX contract. I thought this CapEx by on-stream date would imply something like 2% growth this year in gases, but it looks like based on your earlier comments you're doing at about 0.7% run rate growth from large projects, so I'd be happy to hear some of the reasons for that difference. And then, thirdly, I've noticed now you've started backing out restructuring costs, or restating H1 this year for restructuring costs. And earlier this year you had said that they were largely offset by pension changes in sale of non-current assets, but you're not restating for those figures. Could you remind us the order of magnitude for those benefits you got from the pension income -- or income related to pension changes and for the sales of non-current assets in the first nine months please?
Wolfgang Buechele
Let me take the first one. That's Wolfgang speaking. We have currently for 2017 a pipeline of â¬430 million and this is obviously without the project in Malaysia, which comes factually on top. But from an accounting perspective, as I've said before, this project will only be accounted for once the plant is up and running and the plan that this plant is up and running is 2019. Therefore, this will not technically add to the â¬430 million, but factually we have to, of course, assume that a substantial three-digit million amount we have actually published, it's a substantial three-digit million amount, will be added in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And overall for the time being the pipeline is currently around â¬580 million without the Malaysian project. So now the next question was regarding the restating. We have restated because in Q3 -- originally we have said, if you recall, we have actually increased the focused saving target to â¬230 million, up from â¬180 million. But as we have found that while testing certain measures we want to roll out in the Focus program, especially in Q3, they suit better and they are very much aligned with our intentions for LIFT. We have literally brought back Focus to â¬180 million and have now made the â¬50 million, if you want, as part of LIFT, as we have discussed earlier. And from that point of view approximately, give or take, â¬30 million have been reclassified from previous quarters, which have been actually made up with pensions.
Jeremy Redenius
So just to clarify those, on the first answer you had said the total CapEx in the pipeline is roughly â¬580 million, â¬430 million of which is in 2017, plus additional contributions from Malaysia that we can follow up on?
Wolfgang Buechele
Yes.
Jeremy Redenius
And then, secondly, you said about â¬30 million of these positive effects. And then my third question was about the CapEx in 2016. It implies something like 2% growth and looks like you're run rating 0.7%.
Sven Schneider
The on-site growth, ex end of contracts, is above 2%.
Wolfgang Buechele
So, as we have shown in the slide, if you look back, the comparable growth, if you exclude and correct for the end of contracts was 2.2%, because what we have -- just as a reminder, you might have just overlooked that. We had last year the bankruptcy case, for example, in the UK, where a steel mill went down and we lost that contract forever.
Sven Schneider
And if I may make one more comment on the on-site growth, and please bear in mind that this is -- does not take into consideration adjustment for energy and the other feedstock, so there is some margin which would need to come on top of the above 2% that we have communicated in the last call.
Wolfgang Buechele
So therefore [Technical Difficulty] sits.
Jeremy Redenius
Yes, I followed that part about on-site overall and the effect of SSI. I was following up on Neil's question about new revenue from big new projects this year. I think you said â¬70 million, â¬75 million contribution first nine months, which is about 0.7%, which sounds like slower than expected from big new projects this year.
Wolfgang Buechele
Well, I think major projects, for example, went on-stream only in Q3, for example, the project in Finland. And from that point of view you will now see as they ramp up. In Finland we were just on-stream, then the customer had force majeure and went down again, and from that point of view you see now the gradual ramp up and, from that point of view, the contribution in Q4 will be higher than what we had in Q3.
Jeremy Redenius
And any big new projects in Q4 this year?
Wolfgang Buechele
No, there is nothing big. There is only from today's perspective -- because we were only so far supplying tiny quantities, Sadara is supposed to ramp up in Q4, and from that point of view that's the only one which is sizeable enough to be mentioned here. But we don't know exactly at this point how Sadara is really coming now up on-stream with the units we are supplying.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Mackey, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Mackey
Good afternoon, everybody, a few questions left please. I wonder, first, if you could talk about -- I think there was some suggestion in some of the headlines we've been seeing that there were risks to the engineering margin, the 8% engineering margin, and obviously the restructuring is part of addressing those risks. What are those risks? The engineering margin's actually in line with your very, very long-term guidance, the order intake's been okay, the backlog's still -- actually, going back over several years is still at a relatively healthy level, so I wonder if you could just talk about where the risks were in engineering. Secondly, if you pull apart -- if one pulls apart the growth in healthcare in the third quarter, extracting CB3 effects, extracting the scope effects and so on, it looks as if Lincare is growing only at around 3% or 3.5% in the quarter, and it has been running at 7%, 8%, 9% I think. So I wonder if you could just talk about the dynamics there, the roll-up strategy and so on. And finally the -- just going back to the discussion about dividends and share buybacks and so on, you talked about and highlighted the declining net debt to EBITDA ratio. Should we consider the step up in dividends and the discussion around share buybacks -- essentially, are you looking to stabilize the net debt to EBITDA ratio at the moment? Thank you.
Wolfgang Buechele
Peter, let me take the first question regarding engineering. There is not a direct risk to the margin. There is always in this difficult environment, there is a risk for capacity utilization of our engineering division, and if there would be under-utilization then, obviously, there would be an implication on the margin. But at least for the time being we don't see that risk and from that point of view, we are absolutely comfortable with respect to the margin for the remainder of the year. Projects are under solid development and, as you've seen, we could book in Q3 the second train for Gazprom. And from that point of view our order book is currently standing at around â¬4.3 million, which is also a very -- â¬4.3 billion, sorry. Of course, â¬4.3 billion -- which is a very solid one, so from that point of view capacity is what we have monitor very closely, but at least immediately and for the time being there is no risk.
Peter Mackey
Could I just interrupt on that as well? There was some articles I think in the German press two or three weeks ago suggesting the risk of some site closures in engineering. Is that something that you might consider if that utilization does become a problem?
Wolfgang Buechele
Look, I think we always have to be clear. Also in engineering, for example, we had a site closure -- or a partial site closure and partial divestment in the Nordics, because with ABB -- AB Cryo we decided that it's not core business of Linde Engineering to build trucks for helium and the like, so we divested that part of the business. And the helium tank manufacturing was relocated from Sweden down to Schalchen here in Germany. And from that point of view that was one of the Schalchen site closures. Then you might have read we have closed down Bertrams Heatec in Switzerland, which was in special, let's say, technologies where, historically, we saw a big market potential in metal melts et cetera as heat carriers, salt melts as heat carriers. And these technologies didn't really take off the way we saw that and we have closed down, therefore, because first we tried to sell, that failed, and that's why we closed down Bertrams Heatec. In the Q3 figures, there is a provision as part of Lift for a, let's say, optimization in one of our manufacturing sites of Linde Engineering. And from that point of view, yes, Linde Engineering is part of Lift, but we are not now under way and want to generally close down sites. We will now discuss with the teams, step by step, how we best optimize and how we best deal with the capacity outlooks and then we will keep you posted. But there is no plan that we are now going out to close a number of sites at Linde Engineering.
Peter Mackey
Okay.
Wolfgang Buechele
Does that clarify the engineering piece?
Peter Mackey
It does indeed. Thank you.
Wolfgang Buechele
So then let me move on to Lincare. First of all, the growth is maybe a little bit at this point lower than what it was before, nevertheless, it was a solid growth. And what we are, of course -- what we have done in Q3 is also we have slowed down a little bit our acquisition spree, because we were monitoring very closely how CB2 re-bid ramped in with the customers, that we are not paying for something we ultimately don't get. Because you know very well that the impact is not coming on day one in full, but it's gradually ramping in, and that's why some of the acquisition projects which we have in our pipeline at Lincare have been now put a little bit on the slowdown, but I would suggest that this is now ramping up in Q4 again. And from that point of view you will see definitely a solid growth also with Lincare going forward.
And now, regarding the share buyback, I would hand over to Sven.
Sven Schneider
Thank you, Wolfgang. Yes, on your net debt question of 1.8 and guidance, I mean firstly, we do not want to guide the net debt to EBITDA. But to give a little bit more perspective to your question I think, firstly, we have given a guidance to the market that the upper limit is the 2.5 times, as you know. Currently we stand at 1.8, given the very strong cash flow generation. But going forward I think there are a couple of factors and we still need to see how they develop. We continue to expect a solid cash flow going forward. We have said that we reduce the CapEx guidance to 11% to 12%. And then, of course, if this would continue for a longer period then you would see the net debt to EBITDA ratio going down. And if this would materialize and if we would not see additional growth opportunities -- profitable growth opportunities then -- as I've said earlier, then we would evaluate even stronger a share buyback.
Peter Mackey
So you're suggesting that things are not imminent, the immediate guidance is regarding the dividend and maybe you'll look at other opportunities as we go through 2017, maybe even 2018? It's not a six-month strategy.
Sven Schneider
I think that's a fair assumption, yes.
Wolfgang Buechele
And look, just that we are clear, according to German SEC rules, if we would make a decision on share buybacks we would have to announce them in a talk message instantly. And from that point of view we cannot speculate about these things, because otherwise we would violate SEC rules, but the timeframe we've just discussed I think is a realistic one.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Clark, SocGen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark
I'll cut straight to it. The strategic plan has the three goals of margin, return on capital and shareholder value and, obviously, a lot of people would probably think that's better served with Praxair and, certainly, the growth issue as well maybe, addressed with the Gulf Coast where there still seems to be projects. Now you've said its history for whatever reason. Obviously, it came with risk as well. So obviously balancing that with your standalone strategy now and the cost cutting; just how you can relay the message of confidence that you can close a sufficient amount of the gap to outweigh the risk that would come with that sort of project. And then the second question on the cost cutting and the streamlining issue of things. You still have a little bit of a matrix through the organization. Obviously, air products and Prax don't. Is this streamlining basically cleaning that out now? I know you've already done some work on that. Just wondering if it completely goes with this focus on cost cutting.
Wolfgang Buechele
First of all, I think you hit the nail on the head. Clearly, we are also, as part of Lift, addressing the matrix. Whether you have a very solid, strong matrix, or whether you have a lighter matrix that's part of our analysis. And obviously we are very clear if you take your â¬360 million, you can do the math roughly where we can get with the margin. And from that point of view you get a certain idea. I said before we are not shooting due to portfolio reasons to a margin of 33% or 34%, but we will definitely get closer to 30%, and where we get with Lift you can calculate. And I would suggest with the measures we have on the drawing board we are very well on track to deliver, and we will have two timescales, as I said earlier. Obviously, the overseas regions will move faster, because they are not bound and subject to co-determination, whereas, obviously, especially in continental Europe and in northern Europe, we have to follow the rules of co-determination, country-specific, and therefore we will move a little bit slower. But nevertheless we will also shoot for, let's say, concluding negotiations, if possible, somewhere beginning of the second quarter next year.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Knud Hinkel, Equinet Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Knud Hinkel
First of all I would like to know, because pension provisions have been sharply up in the third quarter, where the discount rate is right now after that rising of pension provisions. Secondly, with regard to the announced management change in April next year, I would like to know who will be ultimately in charge for the implementation of Lift?
Wolfgang Buechele
So let me start with the last question. That will be very clearly the Board and, obviously, together with the Board also my successor, whoever that will be. But the Lift program was very clearly designed as a Board approach. The Board will continue to implement the Lift program as diligently as we start now to set it up and get it on track. And as you've heard from Sven that one-third of the one-timers will already be booked this year, we're shooting to pretty quickly implement the Lift program, because according to IFRS you can only take charges when decisions on certain elements or certain measures have been taken. And from that point of view the full Board is committed. And I would suggest to ask simply, as one Board member who is the room who we have not talked about, but is also in charge of a large region, I think Bernd will commit clearly in this round that he will, in Europe, continue to implement Lift and will not play hide and seek once I leave.
Bernd Eulitz
So, Knud, I can reassure you and all in the call that this program was developed by the full Board. It is not a single program only by the CEO; it's the whole Board that has developed this program. The senior management is included. Everybody is working on this. Everybody is committed. Everybody understands the need to follow up. And the fact that some of the projects are already in execution, and the first â¬50 million we have talked about are already in execution shows that we are running very fast to deliver this. So from my perspective you have the commitment. We will follow through. I think I can say that for all my Board colleagues.
Wolfgang Buechele
And for the pension I would hand over to Sven.
Sven Schneider
Yes, Knud, thank you for the question. So, I mean you raise a very important point. We are in uncharted territory when you look at the interest rates and, therefore, also discount rates. So if we look at the development in 2016, the very important discount rate in the UK where we have roughly 60% of our pension obligations, went down from 3.9% to 2.3%. This is amazing; that's 1.6%. In Germany it went down from 2.5% to 1.4%. And that explains -- although, I have to say we had very positive and strong asset performance, but this explains the increase of the liabilities. And to add one more thing, we have been a little bit unlucky here, because the interest rates were at the lowest on 30th of September. For example, the UK gilts have moved up significantly since the quarter, but that is water under a bridge. That doesn't help for these numbers.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Martin Evans, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin Evans
Just one on this strategic plan. If I can pick up, Wolfgang, your -- or the comment about the Board running very fast with this project, which obviously you won't be there to oversee once you've left. Looking at what it is, streamlining global footprints and optimizing capacity, it all seems pretty basic business management. I guess the question is why did the Board, or you and the Board, not implement this policy before, or if you wanted to, why didn't you? Was there internal resistance at Linde to implement some of these streamlining changes to the structure?
Wolfgang Buechele
Let me walk a little bit -- first of all, thanks, Martin, for your question. There was no resistance within Linde and there is no resistance within Linde, to be very clear. When we were looking back when we initiated Focus, obviously, the first step was to -- at that time, if you recall, to harmonize the organization across the globe. We had a very diverse organizational model. We have literally harmonized. We have achieved that. We have defined the roles. We have got that straight. And now the next step is that we, within these harmonized organizations, drive the efficiency and look for simplification. We have talked about the matrix, whether we -- and to what extent we move to a lighter matrix. All these steps can only be done when the first step has been implemented. And if you see how quickly we were able to come up with this program after another option failed, obviously, this program was not hammered out in the last two weeks or so. This program was on the drawing board for quite a while as a next step, because we have already tested some of the measures, as you also have heard, because we have reclassified certain one-time items of the first half of the year. This program at least certain measures have been tested already in certain parts of the world for further rollout, so this project is not a result of the imminent past, but is a consequent preparation which went on while Focus was implemented. But we needed Focus first in order to do the next step. Does that clarify?
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Lutz Grueten, Commerzbank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Lutz Grueten
Thanks for clarifying that we're talking about â¬320 million cost savings instead of â¬370 million. I'm just a bit puzzled regarding the full-year target 2017. In today's presentation you have stated that there is the target to achieve at least â¬180 million by end of next year. In a former presentation you've stated â¬230 million, so are we talking about â¬180 million instead of â¬230 million, or are we talking â¬180 million from Lift plus â¬50 million from Focus, all together again â¬230 million?
Wolfgang Buechele
Just let me clarify again. I said that before already. Originally we had, for Focus, â¬180 million. Then we have increased in our last presentation to â¬230 million, but now we have taken Focus down again to â¬180 million, because the additional â¬50 million fit much better -- because that was literally the testing et cetera what we did for the Lift program. And that's why it fits better to the Lift and that's why we have reclassified that. So Focus is now back to â¬180 million and the rest comes from Lift. That's the logic. Is that clear?
Lutz Grueten
Focus is â¬180 million and LIFT is â¬50 million, isn't it? Sorry, yes, it's clear. It's clear, â¬230 million.
Wolfgang Buechele
No, again, when you take the total program, Focus is â¬180 million and LIFT is â¬370 million. That's the last column on page number 5.
