Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions].
We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp Incorporated may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements.
In last night's press release, the company included its Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation.
For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investor Bancorp's filings with the SEC.
And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp.
Kevin Cummings
Thank you, Gary, and good morning and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's fourth quarter earnings call.
Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $75.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2020. This compares to $64.3 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the three months ended in the third quarter September 30, and $48.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2019.
These results represent a 17% increase in earnings from the third quarter of 2020 and a 54% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019. On an EPS basis, the increase in earnings represents 19% increase over the linked quarter and a 68% increase over the prior-year's quarter.
There were non-core transactions that impacted our fourth quarter and our results for this year. During the quarter, we recorded a gain from two sale leaseback transactions totaling $22.8 million, which was offset by the early extinguishment of long-term borrowings of $44.1 million in expense. This transaction will have a positive effect on our net interest margin in future years and especially 2021.
In addition, in the fourth quarter, we also recorded a restructuring charge of $11.7 million with the anticipated closure of 10 branches, which will result in cost savings of approximately $4 million on an annual basis in the future.
Taking these transactions into effect and the related tax impact, our core operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $84 million or $0.35 per diluted share, which reflects a 1.27% return on average assets and a return on tangible equity of 13% for the quarter.
On an annual basis, in addition to the items previously mentioned, we also had a transaction costs related to our acquisition of Gold Coast Bank in the second quarter, which negatively impacted earnings by approximately $3.6 billion earlier in the year. Taking all these items into effect, plus the related tax impact, earnings or core earnings were $234 million and $0.99 per diluted share for the year-ended December 31, 2020.
Despite a difficult year with the pandemic, we ended the year with strong results and moved into 2021 with great momentum. As a result of the strong quarterly results, excellent credit metrics, and strong capital ratios, our board approved a $0.02 increase or 17% in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share. In addition, the company bought back approximately 2 million shares during the fourth quarter for approximately $20.5 million.
We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity, and a robust credit culture to maintain this dividend and to continue to move forward with our treasury stock buyback program. While there are still uncertainties in our economy and our markets, we are more optimistic for the future than earlier in the year.
During this year, our core deposits increased 21% with non-interest deposits increasing 48% to $3.7 billion, which is approximately 19% of total deposits versus 14% last year. We continue to focus on driving our core deposits into the bank and we have made significant progress calling on small and mid-sized companies even during this pandemic.
To our marketing and culture departments, we've been holding virtual e-learning events with our customers throughout this pandemic. These are similar to local Chamber of Commerce events, where we bring in noted authors and speakers available in Zoom meetings to discuss current sales and virtual networking techniques during this pandemic.
In fact, we had a session yesterday attended by over 550 customers and prospects with Boomer Esiason and Phil Simms, along with Steve Adubato an Emmy Award winning TV and radio hosts. These sessions have been well received, and have kept our brand and our momentum strong in the markets that we serve.
In the fourth quarter, we expanded our consumer online account opening capabilities by adding 17 additional products to our platform, and enabling account opening for existing customers through our online and mobile banking platforms. These efforts have allowed us to move closer to a true omni channel account opening experience and better assist customers and prospects during the pandemic and has resulted in 161% increase in online account openings in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.
Our mobile deposit user base experienced a 72% increase in users during 2020. We continue to refine our mobile deposit functionality. And in a note in November, we rolled out an enabled technology that sets customers mobile deposit limits, using AI for customers based on their account activity.
Consumer Digital Bank users increased 3% for the year, as we accelerate the migration of our small business customers to a new online banking program and that has experienced an additional 6% increase in users. Our ZELLE user base was up 124% from the previous year. And in late September, we enabled ZELLE for small business customers which should help drive in the more usage of this device, of this service.
For the future, we intend to continue to invest in our online account opening capabilities and we will love to extend this functionality to our small business customers. In addition, this functionality will be used in our branches to speed-up the account opening process and improve the customers experience onsite in the branch.
There was certainly a year of change and a year of progress. But these investments in our digital platform over the last few years have paid dividends for us during the pandemic.
On loan front, we had a strong quarter in the business lending group; as C&I loans increased over $500 million or 15% after giving effect to the share of the PP loans of $328 million. As you may recall, our strategy prior to the pandemic was to use the cash flows from our resi and multifamily books to fund growth in our business lending focusing on relationship banking, and driving lower cost deposits into the bank.
As a result of market forces, our investments in new loan officers and business development personnel on the retail side, we have seen an increase in non-interest bearing deposits and business lending start of this year.
Despite the uncertainty during the year, we were able to reposition our focus and be more on the offensive in the latter part of 2020. We're cautiously optimistic going into this year and remain confident that we have a good understanding of our credit risks due to the credit process that we've established monitoring these loans, monitoring our performing portfolio, non-performing portfolio, and the loan deferral portfolios.
With respect to our loan deferral portfolio at year-end, we saw a slight increase in commercial loans of $42 million to $635 million from $593 million in the third quarter. This increase is primarily due to one multifamily loan of $37 million, which went on its first deferral in late December. It should be noted, I want to highlight that 80% or $509 million of these loans are paying us interest and tax escrow as we only defer the principal payment. We believe this approach is a fair approach to our borrowers during these difficult times, and allows them to manage their businesses and their properties during this unprecedented epidemic. This is a commitment by both us and the borrower to do the right thing.
As we look at the remaining 20% of the deferrals of principal and interest approximately $126 million. There were five loans to four borrowers that make up the majority or $109 million of this exposure. Two of the properties are multifamily loans in Brooklyn; one is a multifamily loan in Washington, DC area that just went on deferral status; and one is a community theater located in New Jersey. The remaining $17 million is comprised of 27 loans, mainly to small businesses in our market footprint, with the largest loan in this Group for $2.3 million, which is an investment property secured by real estate. The remaining 26 loans have an average balance of approximately $565,000. So by covering those five loans and four borrowers, we cover a good portion of the exposure to the 20% principal and interest deferrals.
We continue to meet weekly to discuss these credits, and other credits in our portfolio. In fact, we have met 38 times since June 3 in a wall-room setting with participation from all levels of management and lines of business. This credit review process is the significant priority of the bank. And we believe, we have -- today we believe we have a good handle on our exposures.
Our commercial delinquency turns improved for the quarter with no new significant problems on the horizon and the 30-day multifamily loan delinquencies all are current today, well less than 30 days past due to as of today. In the CRE 30-day bucket, $8.3 million is current and $1 million is a matured loan waiting for extension. In the C&I Group, three loans for $750,000 are also in the process of extension.
For the $5.4 million in the commercial 60-days delinquency, the largest loan in this group is a CRE loan for $2.6 million with a 20% LTV. So no significant problems, while losses are anticipated at this time from these smaller loans in this category.
Our commercial non-accrual loans are down 24% for the quarter. In the non-accrual category our two largest exposures in this group are two multifamily loans, one for $14.9 million, and the other a smaller loan for $4.4 million. The smaller loan has a contract for sale with no loss anticipated and the larger loan is adequately written down to a value we expect to recover through foreclosure process or sale of the loan. The remaining $41 million is comprised of 63 loans for an average balance of approximately $660,000 with no significant exposure to the bank.
As a result of the strong performance of our portfolio, net recoveries of $2.1 million and an improving economic recovery. Our provision for the quarter was a credit of $2.7 million, which allowed our ratio of the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans to remain relatively flat to the prior-quarter at 1.36% versus 1.37%.
It is also noted that our coverage ratio to non-accrual loans improved to 264% at year-end compared to 218% at the end of the third quarter.
We'll remain diligent in our monitoring process and look forward to driving loan growth in the coming months. We believe that our opportunities in our markets as a strong community bank can deal with borrowers, especially in this environment more easily than some of the national banks.
We look forward to a strong year from our commercial lending teams as we are well-positioned to capture market share after such a strong fourth quarter.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Sean Burke, our CFO, who will give some additional commentary on our operating results for the quarter. Sean?
Sean Burke
Thank you, Kevin.
Net interest margin increased 19 basis points to 2.98% in the fourth quarter; our core margin expanded 16 basis points. Declining deposit costs, cash balances plus the extinguishment of wholesale funding drove the improvement. Total non-interest income totaled $45.8 million, an increase of $25.9 million quarter-over-quarter. Excluding gains on our sale leaseback transactions in the quarter, non-interest income totaled $22.6 million, an increase of $2.7 million quarter-over-quarter, driven largely by continued strong mortgage banking activity and customer swap fees.
With respect to non-interest expenses, excluding $23 million of costs from the early extinguishment of debt, $12 million of branch closure costs, and $1 million of a tax credit investment, non-interest expenses for the quarter were $107 million, an increase of $3 million compared to the third quarter. The increase was primarily driven by incentive compensation, given strong fourth quarter results.
Provision for credit losses was a negative $2.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to $8.3 million for the third quarter. The decrease was driven primarily by an improving economic forecast and net loan recoveries in the quarter of $2 million.
Total loan balances increased $125 million quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of the sale of our PPP loans totaling $328 million.
Excluding the sale of PPP loans, C&I loans grew $505 million, or 15% quarter-over-quarter. Total deposits were up $422 million quarter-over-quarter, including non-interest bearing deposits, which were up $318 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter.
Our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 19% at year-end 2020 compared to 14% a year-ago.
During the quarter, we extinguished $1 billion in wholesale funding at an average cost of approximately 2%. Year-to-date, borrowings were down $2.5 billion and our ratio of borrowings to assets declined to 13% from 22% a year-ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continued to remain in a solid position at quarter-end. Non-accrual loans represented 0.51% of total loans at December 31, 2020, compared to 0.63% at September 30, while our allowance for credit losses to loans remained unchanged at 1.44%.
Our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 13% at quarter-end, our loan to deposit ratio was 107%, compared to 122% in year-end 2019.
Finally, I'd like to share some high-level guidance for 2021. We're targeting loan growth in the 6% to 10% range and deposit growth in the 6% to 7% range.
Net interest margin is forecasted in the 3% area for full-year 2021.
Non-interest income is expected in the range of $65 million to $75 million and expenses in the $425 million range. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the area of 27%.
Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for some concluding remarks.
Kevin Cummings
Okay. Thanks, Sean.
In total, what a year 2020 has been. We've gone from unbelievable fear and uncertainty in the early part of the first quarter to 2021, a year of great possibilities. Having finished consecutive quarters of double-digit return on tangible equity, we're pleased but not satisfied with our results. We're hopeful with the rollout of the vaccine and are we're well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. We are very optimistic and look forward to this upcoming year.
So now I'd like to turn the meeting over to questions and open up the line. Gary?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
The first question is from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Hey, guys. Good morning. Sean, just to clarify, did you give NIM guidance? I think I missed that when you were saying.
Sean Burke
Yes, Mark. For the full-year 2021, our guidance was 3% area.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay, great. And then secondly of the loans you have on deferral, what is the expiration schedule, those deferrals look like over the fourth quarter?
Kevin Cummings
Hey Mark, a number of the loans mature, some due sometime in November and December, and we have a chunk coming due in April also. So I would say of the $635 million commercial loans, approximately 20% is coming due in the middle of the year, and about 70% is coming due towards the end of 2021. And the rest is scattered throughout the year, but a big chunk coming due at the end of the year.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Okay. And then, Dom, you guys have benefited to a great degree from the declining rates, it's certainly benefited your margin. At what point would you expect to start kind of reducing liability sensitivity and positioning the balance sheet for higher rates?
Domenick Cama
Well, we've already started doing that Mark. We were doing that in 2020 as we saw rates come down. So significantly, we entered into a number of swap transactions that had an average costs ranging anywhere from 55 basis points to 65 basis points. In addition, we have also positioned the loan portfolio where we're doing more customer-facing swaps. And so we've reduced our liability sensitivity at year-over-year and we still have some work to do. But we think we're in a pretty good position for the next few years. And we continue to look at ways to reduce that liability sensitivity.
Mark Fitzgibbon
Thank you. And then last question is on M&A. I wonder, it strikes me that 2021 could be a fairly active year for M&A? How are you guys thinking about it? What are sort of your priorities? And what would be most appealing from the acquisition or sales standpoint in a potential partner?
Domenick Cama
Yes. I think Mark; we want to continue to take the bank into a point of being more commercial like. And so bank that can add obviously, more non-interest bearing deposits, more C&I type loans, those are appealing to us because ultimately, we believe that being more commercial bank like and reducing our reliance on resi, and multifamily is a better way to go both from an ROE perspective and from a valuation perspective.
Operator
The next question is from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steven Duong
Hey, just want to go into your 6% to 10% loan guidance. I assume that includes the $300 million or so in the Berkshire acquisition?
Kevin Cummings
Yes.
Steven Duong
Okay. And I guess if you were to strip that out, I guess where do you see the loan growth coming from primarily, you had such a really strong C&I this quarter, maybe just give us some more color and then and we're seeing that as a read-through for this year?
Kevin Cummings
Yes, it's a good question, Steve. We see the growth coming primarily from the commercial real estate sector, and C&I sector. As you point out, C&I had a strong year for us, even without PPP. And we're continuing our focus there. We've seen our multifamily spreads widen over the last six months. And so while we took a backseat to multifamily lending in the early part of the year, we've fully ramped down our CRE and our multifamily business up again. And to the point where our CRE pipelines these days are about $1.04 billion and C&I is about $600 million. So the C&I pipeline at its peak was probably closer to a $1 billion and so we have some building to do there. But CRE pipeline, we think is in a good spot.
And that will help us grow in 2021. We continue to see residential run-off to some degree. And so we think that'll be more than offset by the commercial real estate business.
Steven Duong
Yes, it's really such a great quarter on the C&I side. Was there an increased demand or was it just more of you guys putting more sweat into it?
Kevin Cummings
Yes, I think it's the latter.
Steven Duong
Okay. That was great to hear.
Kevin Cummings
Steve, the latter part of 2019 and early 2020, we hired some loan officers, that it takes them a while to get up and going. And we had some -- we had some pretty good loans in the education space out on Long Island, in the non-profit space. And it was pretty, I got that -- actually a lot of these people I didn't meet -- I've meet them on Zoom calls. And they're pretty productive. And they came in, and finally put some numbers up on the board in the fourth quarter after a slow start in the first half of the year --
Steven Duong
It's great to hear that --
Kevin Cummings
I think it's basically neutral, the additions to the team.
Steven Duong
Yes, it's great to hear that that's paid off. And then, I guess, just on buybacks, what are you guys thinking about for this year?
Kevin Cummings
I'm not sure, in total, in terms of dollar amounts, or volumes, but clearly we'll continue to look at the attractiveness of the stock. Obviously, it's moved quite a bit from us -- from when we first started to put buybacks in place. And we're waiting till earnings are done. And, Sean and I will sit down and kind of go through what we think is the right level to be buying at.
Sean Burke
We do have some repurchases built into 2021, Steven. I think it's safe to assume that 6 million to 7 million shares would probably be on the lower end. But again, it all depends on the stock price and kind of -- how the market trends. But I think, if you were modeling this up, I think it's safe to assume, 6 million to 7 million of shares repurchased throughout the year.
Steven Duong
Yes, got it. And are you targeting a capital level, just for modeling purposes at all?
Kevin Cummings
Well, capital has inched up a little bit. We always, again, I answered this question. It depends on the environment we're in. In 2020, it was much more comfortable being at around 9.5% in a more normal environment is probably closer to 8.5%. So again, that's a tough question dependent on the economic environment that we find ourselves in.
Operator
The next question is from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
Well, hi, good morning. Just wondered if we could go back to back for a minute I just want to clarify. So after the 2 million share repurchase this quarter, there's currently 12.6 million shares remaining in your authorization; is that right number or is that --?
Kevin Cummings
Yes, yes.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And historically, you've been active above current levels? Can you just share with us why you would only do half of that this year?
Kevin Cummings
Well, again, Laurie, we want to be careful about how we allocate our buybacks. Sean said we do have 75 million or so built in for 2021. But clearly, we don't want to get over our skis in terms of buying at valuations that are too high. Right the earn back on that, wouldn't, would not be good for us. So we're trying to assess where the market is, where the valuations are going. And, we're confident in our business. But again, we want to be careful about where we are and want to make sure that when we enter back, when we continue our buyback program, that we're doing it in a prudent way.
Sean Burke
Yes, Laurie, we increased the dividend, an extra penny actually than we had originally planned in our strategic plan. So that picks up about $10 million return to the shareholders. And then when you look at the economic uncertainty, that's why we're hedging our bets here a little bit. We're not going to put some number out there. We don't want to overpromise and under deliver with respect to buybacks.
Laurie Hunsicker
Perfect that makes sense. Okay. And then I wondered if we could just switch back over the multifamily loan, the $37 million that came on deferral where was that located?
Sean Burke
That was in Washington, DC. It's about 600 unit apartments.
Laurie Hunsicker
That was [indiscernible]. Okay, great. Okay, great. And then do you have to your multifamily loans of $7 billion round number is $3 billion in New York. Do you have a refresh on what New York City multifamily deferrals were?
Domenick Cama
Yes, New York City multifamily deferrals $74 million, I'm sorry $91 million.
Laurie Hunsicker
$91 million, okay. Okay, so $91 million of the round number $3 billion was on deferral?
Domenick Cama
$91 million of the $635 million is -- are multifamily loans in Manhattan. And the weighted average LTV of those loans in Manhattan is 53%.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And that's up from -- last quarter that number was around $12 million?
Domenick Cama
I don't know, Laurie. I don't have.
Laurie Hunsicker
You don't, okay. Okay, fair enough. So just on New York, can you give us a refresh in terms of your overall New York City deferral exposure? I think last quarter, we had $313 million. So just of your total loans, how much is New York City deferral? And then do you have a breakdown today in terms of out of that, how much is hotel?
Domenick Cama
It's $371 million in Manhattan. Of the $635 million itâs $371 million and the breakdown is $91 million in multifamily, $38 million in CRE, C&I is $1 million and hotel, lodging is $241 million.
Operator
The next question is from Zach Westerlind with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Zach Westerlind
Good morning, guys. It's Zach Westerlind filling in for Matt Breese.
Kevin Cummings
Hi, how are you?
Sean Burke
Hi, Zach.
Zach Westerlind
Good, thanks. Just one really quick one from me. What was PPP income for the quarter?
Domenick Cama
Well, we sold our PPP loans, Zach, in the fourth quarter, and the revenue on it was about $7 million overall.
Sean Burke
But for the quarter Zach it was less than $1 million.
Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Cummings, for any closing remarks.
Kevin Cummings
Okay, thank you, Gary.
Our retail and lending teams are engaged and excited to be working and more importantly, by helping our customers and our communities through this pandemic. And I want to thank them for their efforts over the last nine, 10 months.
This past year has not been easy. But we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. To all the challenges, uncertainties and hardships, we're stronger, but maybe a more humble bank, and understand that we're not driving the bus, but only passengers. We understand that it's not enough for the bank to be successful. But this year, will be our year to leave an imprint on our story or on our history.
This year will be our year to create a legacy of significance for our employees, our customers, and the communities that we serve, and that we take care of them. Hopefully, our shareholders will prosper.
During this crisis, we didn't give people what they wanted. We gave them what they needed. And I think at the end of the day, everyone needs inspiration. Everyone needs hope and everyone needs faith. And that faith most importantly is a belief in ourselves, our bank, our communities, and our country to be the very best we can be during these troubled and unprecedented times.
I'm happy to report through the hard work of Dom and members of our retail and healthcare teams we'll be announcing shortly a major grant to a Regional Hospital to support their new treatment center for post-COVID care. One of the few such centers in our region and around the country, this setup will serve as both a clinical and research based facility to support and treat post-COVID patients and will be named the Investor Bank post-COVID Care Center. And when I think about it, what better legacy to have than to make our community a little bit better today than it was yesterday. And that in a nutshell, is our bank's mission.
And we look forward to 2021 with much optimism, and it's going to be a year of great possibilities.
I want to thank you for your time today. I want you all to be safe and enjoy the Super Bowl next week.
On yesterday's Zoom call with Boomer and Phil, they each picked different teams. So one of them has to be right, Bommer, Kansas City and Phil, Tampa Bay. I think I'm going to go with coach Reid and the Chiefs because in reference to Mark Fitzgibbon, I will never underestimate Tom Brady. Either way, is should be a good game, enjoy it.
And I look forward to hopefully seeing you all soon at a conference, a community bank or an industry event in person. Be safe, and stay healthy. Thank you for your time today.

The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
