On behalf of Quintiles, good morning, and welcome to the Quintiles Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Janine and I will be your web event specialist today. At the end of today's presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Todd Kasper, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Kasper, the floor is yours.
Todd Kasper
Thank you, Janine. Good morning and welcome to Quintiles fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; Mike McDonnell, our Chief Financial Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Operating Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 12, 2015 and the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we plan to file later today.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered as supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would like to point out that, as with other global businesses, we have been impacted by foreign exchange. And therefore, we will discuss many of our results in constant currency to improve comparability.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas Pike
Thank you, Todd. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter performance and full-year 2015 results.
Let's begin on slide three with some of the highlights for the fourth quarter. Our net new business performance was strong at $1.49 billion generating a company-wide book-to-bill ratio of 1.32, which included a 1.3 book-to-bill in Product Development and 1.38 book-to-bill in IHS. We delivered 9.4% constant currency service revenue growth with Product Development accelerating to 12.1% growth at constant currency for the quarter.
We grew diluted adjusted earnings per share by 26.8% to $0.90 per share. And our strong net new business helped us extend our industry-leading diversified backlog to over $12 billion. These metrics represent a strong fourth quarter, which contributed to a solid full-year in 2015 that generally played out as we expected.
Some highlights for the full-year. We generated $5.32 billion of net new business driving a full-year book-to-bill ratio of 1.23, our fifth straight year with a consolidated book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.20. We grew service revenues by 9% at constant currency. As we explained at the beginning of 2015, we expected Product Development revenue growth to accelerate during the back half of the year and we're pleased to report that it did. After a strong start to the year, IHS revenue growth moderated toward the end of the year.
We delivered diluted adjusted earnings per share growth of 23.3% to $3.33 per share. And our business generated $397 million of free cash flow in 2015. We also continue to execute on our capital market â sorry, our capital allocation strategy. In 2015, we repurchased $515 million of our common stock and are pleased to report that since our IPO in 2013, we have returned nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders.
In addition, we refinanced and extended maturities and lowered the average overall cost of our outstanding debt. We also extended our industry leadership position by launching the Q2 Solutions' laboratory joint venture with Quest Diagnostics, which is performing well in the marketplace.
As you're aware, we further strengthened our management team. I would now like to take the opportunity to introduce our new CFO, Mike McDonnell, who officially joined us in December. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, Mike has deep technical expertise and experience in complex dynamic industries. He has been transitioning into the role very well and has already been a significant contributor to what we believe is the best management team in the industry.
Earlier this year, Kevin Gordon was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of the company. Kevin is here with us this morning too and will participate in Q&A.
Now, let me hand over to Mike, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail.
Michael McDonnell
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be part of the Quintiles' team and I'm looking forward to working with all of you. Let's begin with consolidated results on slide four.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, consolidated service revenues grew 9.4% at constant currency compared to the same prior year quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 6.1% to nearly $1.13 billion in the quarter, net of an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $35.5 million.
For the year, constant currency revenue growth was 9% compared to the same period in 2014. At actual foreign exchange rates, our service revenues grew 3.9% to over $4.3 billion including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $212.3 million.
The global mix of service revenue shifted slightly towards the Americas compared to the prior year as a result of the strength in real-world and late phase research, North America commercial services in the first half of 2015, increased revenue from Q2 Solutions attributed to the businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics, and the strength of the U.S. dollar.
For the year, the North America and Latin America region contributed approximately 46% of our consolidated revenues. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region contributed nearly 34%, and the Asia Pacific region contributed approximately 20%-plus of total consolidated revenues.
The Product Development segment accounted for 75% of our service revenues while the IHS segment accounted for 25%, a 210 basis point greater contribution from Product Development compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to stronger revenue growth in this segment, including the revenue from businesses contributed by Quest Diagnostics into Q2 Solutions.
During the fourth quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 14.3% to $187.7 million, a margin of 16.6% with 120 basis points of margin expansion. This expansion was comprised of 140 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations across the company, partially offset by slightly lower constant currency margins in the IHS segment.
For the full-year, adjusted income from operations was $679.8 million, representing growth of 13.4%. The adjusted income from operations margin for the full-year was 15.7%, representing 130 basis points of margin expansion all from the benefit of foreign exchange.
For the fourth quarter, SG&A was $244.1 million or 21.6% of service revenues compared to $225.1 million or 21.2% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included the impact of Q2 Solutions formation and increased compensation related costs, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange.
For the full-year 2015, SG&A of $921 million was 21.3% of service revenues compared to $882.3 million or 21.2% of service revenues in the prior year. The dollar increase was primarily due to the businesses that Quest contributed to Q2 Solutions, including transaction-related costs, the Encore acquisition and increased compensation-related costs, partially offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 32.1% during the quarter compared to 29.4% for the same period last year and 29.5% compared to 29.9% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter grew 21.3% to $111.4 million compared to the same period last year. And for the full-year, adjusted net income was $418.9 million, representing growth of 18.5%.
We recognized $7.2 million in net restructuring charges during the fourth quarter and $30.8 million for the year. These charges are associated with the previously-approved and announced February 2015 plan as well as the plan approved in connection with the Q2 Solutions joint venture, which totaled approximately $8.7 million for the full-year for planned integration actions.
Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $3.5 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to Quest Diagnostics' 40% share in Q2 Solutions. For the full-year 2015, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $1.1 million.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 26.8% to $0.90 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.71 per share in the prior year quarter. And for the full-year, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 23.3% to $3.33 per share compared to $2.70 per share in 2014.
Our cash balance was $977 million at the end of the quarter of which $245 million was in the U.S. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $476 million and $397 million respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 13.8% increase in free cash flow compared to the same period last year.
The net cash provided by operations during the period reflects the increase in net income as well as lower payments for interests and income taxes. These increases were partially offset by increase in days sales outstanding, which increased seven days compared to the end of 2014.
Capital expenditures were $78.4 million for the year or 1.8% of service revenues compared to $82.7 million during the same period in 2014. During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 4 million shares of its common stock from shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. These repurchases were funded with cash on hand and there is approximately $144.5 million of authorization remaining under the current repurchase program, which does not have an end date.
Our total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015 was $2.47 billion. Our net debt outstanding defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at December 31, 2015, was $1.49 billion compared to $1.42 billion at the end of December 2014. This increase is due to increased borrowings from the debt refinancing during the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by the higher cash balance. The new business booked during the quarter added $290 million more new backlog than revenue recognized, net of the foreign exchange impact on the backlog resulting in backlog of over $12 billion.
Now, let's move to the two reporting segments beginning on slide five. In Product Development, we booked net new business totaling $1.1 billion representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 times service revenues in the quarter. For the full-year in Product Development, we booked $4.12 billion of net new business, representing a book-to-bill of 1.29 times service revenues.
Product Development's constant currency revenue growth was 12.1% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year and its actual foreign exchange rates grew 9.2% to $845.7 million including $22.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Product Development's constant currency revenue growth benefited from the incremental impact of the business that Quest contributed to Q2 Solutions in addition to volume related increases in the core clinical services, clinical solutions provided on a functional resource basis, and clinical trial support services.
For the year, Product Development's constant currency revenue grew 7.2% and actual foreign exchange rates grew 3% to $3.2 billion, which included a negative impact from foreign exchange of $130 million along with the negative impact from cancelations in 2014, which primarily impacted the first half of 2015 results. Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $200 million, a 19% increase at actual rates and 12% increase at constant currency rates.
Product Development income from operations margin was 23.7% in the quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points compared to the same period last year. This margin improvement included 190 basis points of foreign exchange benefits. For the year, Product Development's constant currency income from operations growth was 5.7% and was 10.8% at actual foreign exchange rates increasing to $714.6 million inclusive of a foreign exchange benefit of $33.1 million.
The income from operations margin for the year finished at 22.4% representing 160 basis points of margin improvement including 190 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations offset by an increase in the billable head count due to the ramp-up of the new projects resulting from new business wins, compensation related costs, and our investment in the expansion of our Global Delivery Network or GDN.
In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $390 million representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.38 times service revenues in the quarter. This net new business was led by strong contributions from commercial services in North America and real-world and late phase services. For the full-year in IHS, we booked $1.2 billion of net new business representing a book-to-bill of 1.06 times service revenues.
IHS service revenues grew 2.2% at constant currency rates in the fourth quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $282.9 million, representing a decrease of 2.3% or a $6.7 million compared to the same period last year, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $13.1 million.
As expected, IHS growth continued to moderate in the quarter due in part to growth in commercial services in the North America in the prior year quarter, which provided a challenging comparable. The constant currency increase in service revenues was attributable to a continuation of strong growth in the real-world and late phase research unit, offset by lower service revenues in commercial North America and Europe, primarily from the loss of revenue from an agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in Italy that ended in the fourth quarter of 2014.
For the year, IHS constant currency revenue grew 14% at an actual foreign exchange rate of 6.3% to over $1.1 billion including a negative foreign exchange impact of $82.6 million. IHS income from operations for the fourth quarter was $23.1 million, an increase of 0.7% at constant currency rates and a decline of 4.6% at actual rates compared to the same period in 2014. The actual income from operations margin for the quarter was 8.2% at actual and constant currency rates.
For the full-year of 2015, IHS constant currency income from operations growth was 45.1% and 29.7% in actual foreign rates, increasing to $84 million including a negative foreign exchange impact of $10 million. The income from operations margin for the year was 7.4% at actual rates and 7.7% at constant currency. Margins improved by 160 basis points at constant currency versus the prior year from a positive service mix change with greater contribution from higher margin services.
Now, turning to 2016 full-year guidance. With our recent strong new business wins, we entered 2016 with $12.04 billion of backlog. We expect to recognize approximately $3.85 billion of this backlog as revenue in 2016. And with our current view of new opportunities in the pipeline, we expect to expect to achieve constant currency service revenue growth of 7% to 8.5%.
Within Product Development, specifically, we expect to continue to transition our recent new business wins from study start-up into higher revenue burning phases as discussed on prior calls. As a result, we expect to achieve a constant currency service revenue growth rate in Product Development of approximately 10% in 2016. We expect the IHS segment constant currency service revenue growth to be in the low single-digits.
We expect to achieve diluted adjusted earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.85 per share, representing growth of 11.1% to 15.6%, and diluted GAAP earnings per share of $3.52 to $3.70 per share. We expect the annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%. This financial guidance assumes January foreign currency exchange rates remain in effect for the remainder of the year and does not reflect the potential impact of any future equity repurchases.
I will now turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas Pike
Thank you, Mike. As you've heard, a strong fourth quarter and year for Quintiles. We are seeing acceleration in the CRO side of the business coming out of 2015 and into 2016 and now have over $12 billion backlog. Now, let me describe some facts about our market backdrop.
There are 45 novel drugs approved last year in the U.S., up from 41 in 2014 and the most in 19 years. The EMA recommended 93 medicines for approval, including 39 new active substances and 18 orphan medicines. There are over 5,000 compounds in the Phase I to Phase III pipelines at the end of 2015, up year-over-year and sequentially.
And according to BioCentury, biotech funding totaled nearly $9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 20% from the same quarter prior year. Overall, a record year for biotech funding. We believe we're well positioned to continue to capitalize on this market backdrop.
We also remain very encouraged by the Product Development. RFP volumes remain consistent with prior quarters. We're seeing studies from our strong net new business at the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015 enter higher revenue burning stages.
As of the end of fourth quarter, we had 9.8% more studies compared to last year in the stage between study award and first site initiation visit. And 41% of our currently-enrolling studies are in early stages of enrollment, which we define as being at less than 25% of the latest overall enrollment target. We're also progressing with programs to accelerate our backlog burn within Product Development, which include two key elements around site performance optimization and finding patients faster.
In this recent market environment, we believe it's worth revisiting what makes us a differentiated market leader. First is consistent execution. We grew through the last financial crisis. Compounded annually since 2011, we have grown adjusted EBITDA 13.7%, and over time, we've proven we consistently win new business. For instance, in Product Development, we've had a 1.2 book-to-bill in 12 quarters of the last 13 quarters, 1.2 or better.
Regarding customer and revenue diversification, we have worked with each of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies as measured by 2014 revenues in each of the past 13 years. In 2015, we had 13 customers from whom we earned at least $100 million in revenue, plus one more at $99 million.
We worked with over 550 biopharmaceutical customers outside of the top 20 as measured by 2014 revenues. We have no customer who represents more than 10% of our revenue. Our revenue is geographically diverse and while we have significant work in the fastest growing therapeutic areas, our therapeutic exposure is diversified.
And last, we have size and scale that our competitors don't. Our team is now some 36,000 strong and boasts over 3,000 PhDs, medical doctors, statisticians, and statistical programmers combined. Our deep expertise in medicine science and statistics provide us with real competitive advantage that allows us to innovate, provide a breadth of offerings, and serve a larger customer set at greater scale and speed.
Our Global Delivery Network is allowing us to extend our industry leadership position by leveraging deep global presence to drive quality, efficiency and productivity for our customers, and ideally, better margins for our shareholders. Given our scale, we're able to invest in technology, data and analytics that create better results for our customers. And as we see shifts in the market toward greater interest in real-world evidence, our real-world and late phase services business is well positioned given its leadership position.
In closing, I'd like to thank and recognize the entire Quintiles team for the hard work, commitment and execution during 2015. This dedication resulted in many accolades during the year, including again being named to the Fortune 500, one of Fortune's Most Admired Companies, the Forbes America's Best Employers List, to the InformationWeek Elite 100, to the â and also the Asia Pacific CRO of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for the seventh time in nine years.
I'll now turn it over to Todd to begin the question-and-answer session.
Todd Kasper
Thank you, Tom. We are ready to take questions. I would ask our participants to please limit their questions to one to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions.
Janine, you may now open the call up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ross Muken with ISI. Please go ahead.
Ross Muken
Hi. Tom, I really appreciate all the color on the end markets and how you guys have sort performed during prior periods. I guess as you think about just sort of the pacing of RFPs over the course of the year and as we lift into 2016, and we think about the win rate and in general, how you guys have executed, help us understand sort of anything at all that you sort of observe about the market that's kind of different or nuanced, maybe versus where we were 12 months ago. And then similarly sort of â so that's bookings.
And then also on just burn, seems like you guys are doing a couple of different things to sort of help that along. Have you sort of gone to a place where you actually think the burn rate could start to kind of move upward?
Thomas Pike
Thanks, Ross. It's interesting, in preparing for this call, we decided if you look at the markets and everything going on, and of course, no one can help but notice what's going on in the stock market. We really just need to stick to the facts of what we see. And the facts of what we see are a continued strong pipeline associated with RFPs and other types of opportunities in the Product Development segment.
On the real-world late phase side, again we continue to see a real strong secular patterns for growth there, just given the interest in the regulatory agencies associated with real-world information. And so, we think those are strong backdrops.
The CSO business continues to be little lumpy, to be honest with you, as it always has been and as we've told you since we went public. So, when you look at our fact set and even in the discussions we are having with customers, right now, it is continue ahead with development just given the signs, given the number of compounds, et cetera. And so, we feel pretty good about that.
I think I will reintroduce Kevin, who got off easy this call, didn't have to creed anything. But Kevin, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the programs we have around backlog burn and your thoughts on that?
Kevin Gordon
Sure. Ross, as you know, we've often talked about what we've established for prime and partner sites, how we're able to create efficiency through the enrollment process by pushing more opportunities through those key sites and key relationships that we have. So we have reemphasized, I think, the value of those sites, the use of those sites to drive recruiting enrollment, which obviously as you understand drives our ability to get things started up faster and get patients in and accelerate that revenue burned.
I think as you look â that's one area. I mean as you look at the complexity that we've seen in the trials that we've had reemphasizing the expertise that we have in those areas with a refocus on getting folks into the trials more quickly is something that we're heavily focused on.
From a clinical development perspective, you saw or you've heard us talk about the number of trials we have in that early phases, and that's extremely important that we focus on those things. The number of trials, well, up over last year as a percentage, they've moved down a little bit in the quarter and that's why you do start to see that revenue growth rate in Product Development that we've talked about coming back more quickly. And I think you not only see it a bit here in the fourth quarter, but you see it coming through into the guidance in 2016.
Ross Muken
Great. And may be, we've seen consolidation across almost every healthcare service vertical. And you're obviously, from a scale perspective, much larger than the rest of your peers and clearly the leader, but there's always space to become bigger. I guess, as you think about the evolution of this complex, is it your view that the current environment in terms of a competitive environment, you have seven players or 10 players of relevant size continues on and you still get bigger, obviously organically, but may be also through tuck-in or do you think at some point, like many other verticals, we actually see a bit more sizeable combinations and really a few players end up materially larger than sort of the rest?
Thomas Pike
That's a big question Ross, and I don't really want to speculate too much on the industry structure. I think some people know that I agree over some period of time, we have a lot of participants in this segment. And so, I do think that there will be some consolidation.
We really remain focused on tactical tuck-ins. I think we've done that very successfully. And if you look back at our acquisition associated with Outcome Sciences in 2011, it's really powered up our business. Our Novella acquisition, it's actually been very successful. And the combination together has gotten us some large device business, for instance, that neither of us would have gotten separately.
And then finally, I guess I could point to a number of them, but Expression Analysis that continues to differentiate us. We are trying to figure out as you see these industry leading projects like [indiscernible] and things, we're trying to figure out how we can help in those things because we have a tool like Expression Analysis in our tool kit. So that remains our focus. I think for us, given our size, scale, and differentiation, regardless of what happens, it will be the leader.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Derik Bruin
Hi. Can you hear me?
Thomas Pike
Hi, Derik. We can hear you.
Derik Bruin
Well. Yeah, great. Thank you. So good margin expansion in 2015. I guess, if you talk a little bit more about what you see in terms of operating margins for 2016 and just talk about with respect to the different groups and underlying performance versus currencies side. I think we're getting a lot of questions on that from investors? Thanks.
Thomas Pike
Yeah. I think Kevin or I will talk about this. I do think, it's interesting as you reflect on this year that certainly if you look at our Product Development segment, our operating model has gotten a little bit of benefit out of foreign exchange. And if you think about it, what we're trying to do as a company is to try to help our customers by doing work that can be done in lower cost areas, in those areas. So we're actively moving that kind of work.
Interestingly, we're still hiring in all geographies. So our business is successful enough that we are still a grower in all geographies, but we're seeing some nice double benefit. Not only are we able to use some work in lower cost environments, but we're actually getting a little FX advantage of it. What it has allowed us to do is, I think, we've talk â Kevin and I talked probably a year ago that when you're growing, you do end up having to take on some resources in this business in advance of that growth and during that growth period. And frankly, given our operating model, using our Global Delivery Network and being able to take on the people that we needed to deliver the work, I think we've had an excellent result.
Derik Bruin
Great. Thank you very much.
Thomas Pike
Thanks.
Operator
And the next questioner is Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Windley
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Around the real-world late phase, Tom, you mentioned or maybe it was Mike, mentioned that the shift in the mix of revenue have come toward the Americas in some part because of the real-world late phase. So my question is what's the kind of the size and geography and profile of say the typical real-world late phase study. And are there services between say in the late stage development and commercialization in that, call it market access real-world and late phase kind of area, that you would still like to add to your portfolio. Thanks.
Thomas Pike
You asked a great question, kind of a detailed question. Actually interestingly, our mix of revenue has shifted a little bit more towards North America, but it's happening a bit across the business. Some of it is the nature of the trials that are taking place in the Product Development segment. And as you get into some areas like oncology and others that tend to be and driven towards North America, certain types of customers prefer, especially the smaller ones, may prefer to have a greater concentration in North America. So you've actually seen this shift a bit across the board.
In terms of real-world late phase, it does and what we're looking at is and you'll read this around the industry, you'll see it around the industry, the regulatory authorities are trying to figure out ways to use real-world late phase data to create a better safety signal and a better understanding of what happens as after we approve the drugs in the marketplace. And so, we do see continued growth there.
And when it comes to the real-world and commercially, you're absolutely right. The thing that ties this whole enterprise together is evidence, and in many ways, you start creating the evidence during the clinical trial, we're starting to see more and more interest in starting real-world studies simultaneously with Phase III clinical trials because there is this greater recognition that you're going to need that data. And then that data, the real-world data is often used in the commercialization because it gives you a better understanding of what's happening geography-by-geography and what's really happening associated with behaviors of physicians associated with the new medication. So, we do see a nice synergy between all those pieces.
David Windley
Thanks.
Operator
And our next questioner is Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Greg Bolan
Thanks guys for taking the question. So, you had mentioned Tom that RFP flow, or excuse me, biotech funding data that guys were observing was up 20% in the fourth quarter. Does that correlate at all with what you guys saw from an RFP perspective? And then I guess just to kind of tack onto this, sorry kind of breaking the rule, just real quickly. But as you think about 2016, what's embedded in your guidance for tuck-in acquisitions? I've got about 180 basis points, just wanted to kind of do a sanity check there. Thanks.
Thomas Pike
Well, let's take the easy answer first. We have no acquisitions in our guidance. So, just to make that clear, Greg, because it just keeps life simpler. So, we have no acquisitions, we have no share repurchases in our guidance.
With regard to biotech, it's interesting. We're still â we are seeing a lot of activity in the biotech sector still. There are industry reports out there that say that they have at least a couple of years of funding associated with them.
And to us biotech is valued based on what it's doing in terms of clinical development. So they significantly increased their value associated with results. So, so far and again I think we need to stick to the facts that we see as opposed to a broader trend, So far, what we're seeing is no real change associated with our fee flow.
Greg Bolan
Thanks.
Operator
Next, we will hear from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert Jones
Great. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to go back to the operating margin specifically within Product Development. As you guys mentioned, it seems like FX was responsible for most of if not all expansion you saw there in 2015, but at the same time I know there was a good amount of investments that you guys were focused on in 2015. So maybe, Tom, just to go back if you could maybe share a little bit more on how you're thinking about the operating margins in Product Development in 2016, assuming FX holds. I mean, do you see opportunities to expand margins in this business organically?
Thomas Pike
Maybe, I'll let Kevin â I took one as bad as that question. Kevin, you want to?
Kevin Gordon
Bob, you hit on all of right points I think even in your question. And I think it was included somewhat in the remarks that were made earlier today. As we ramped up these trials coming through the earlier phases, getting into enrollment, faster revenue burning components as we through 2015. You see us continuing to invest in the Global Delivery Network with most recently looking at expanding new facilities there for to expand the footprint of that network, which will be coming online mid-part of this year and we'll be looking to add additional resources there.
So, there are some investments that are ongoing, and those investments clearly are intended to positively impact overall margins as we go forward. So as Tom said, the business is growing nicely really everywhere globally. We're adding folks globally to support those trials, particularly when the mix might shift a little bit more strongly toward North America in some cases or other parts.
So on the Product Development side, you see very strong margins over 23% here in the fourth quarter, which we intend to maintain those margins through not only growing the opportunities of revenue, but also repositioning where we deliver work most effectively to do that. So in the near-term, still some investment going on, but at a time when we see revenues actually growing at a faster rate. So we'll expect to see some leverage there.
Robert Jones
Okay. Great. Thanks so much.

The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed.
John Kreger
Hi. Thanks very much. Just to go back to Greg's question. Mike, could you may be just give us a sense about in the fourth quarter, how much Quest and other prior acquisitions contributed to the 9.4% constant dollar revenue growth. And carrying into the 7% to 8.5% guidance for the next year, how much previously done deals might add to that. Thanks.
Michael McDonnell
Yeah. So I'll give you a little bit of color on that and then others maybe would then chime in. But what we said was that the Q2, we expected that the run rate of revenue or the contribution of revenue on the back half of 2015 would be about $80 million. And we thought that it would be about breakeven on the EPS line. And I would say that the JV has performed in accordance with expectations. It was actually modestly accretive. I think it contributed about $0.01 in 2015 overall. So, I would say at or slightly better than expectations. And then as we head into 2016, that should give you a reasonably good sense for our run rate. And we would expect obviously it hopefully grow as we get in and certainly contribute more on the EPS line as it scales.
John Kreger
And can you remind us if there's any other previously done deals that are â that haven't anniversaried yet, adding to the numbers?
Michael McDonnell
No, there are not.
John Kreger
Okay, great. Thank you.
Michael McDonnell
Thank you.
Operator
Our next questioner is Michael Baker with Raymond James.
Michael Baker
Yeah. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of wage inflation. Tom, I know you talked about your global resource allocation model? And then if there have been any re-badgings that have kind of helped you out on that front as well would be helpful overall?
Thomas Pike
Yeah. I think I'll start. It is â I'll probably be, Mike, a little specific. We have a term we call the Global Delivery Network. And what that is, is it's a series of locations around the world that have consistent process and practice to be able to first improve the quality of what we do and load balance all around the world and do things at lower prices, at lower cost. We've actually taken this idea from the larger service firms who have this. And so, we're really excited about what that can do both for our customer quality as well as lowering the costs.
And so, I will say, the way we think about this is that, there are certain job positions in this industry that are highly competitive.
In fact, the CRA, the person who visits the investigators, is a highly competitive position. These are great people when you get to spend time with them, rogue warriors many times and there is lot of competitions for them. And what we're trying to do is make sure in these key roles, we're paying market competitively. And then at the same time, other roles where there is the opportunity to do them at lower costs, we're doing that and we're trying to offset the two.
We still had well over 300,000 applications for jobs last year at Quintiles. Now it's, this is a phenomenal brand. And even last night, I got a LinkedIn message from one of our former CRAs who wants to comeback. So, I think, I think we're well positioned in this. It's something we're watching very closely. We'll tell you the changes. But right now, we think we can offset those increases and deliver the kind of results that Mike walked you through earlier.
Michael Baker
Thanks for the additional detail and color.
Thomas Pike
Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Next, we have a question from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Eric Coldwell
Thanks. A couple of mine, if kind of been touched on, so I apologize if I repeat anything here. But I think, Kevin, I think it was you that said that Product Development operating margin was 23.7% in the fourth quarter and you expect to maintain those levels. I guess, I want to clarify that. You're not necessarily saying 23.7% or better, but kind of the trend that you've seen over the last few quarters, it'll still be a good number as we go into 2016. And I think really my question was SG&A is the highest percent of sales that we've seen in about seven reports where I've actually come out of past conversations thinking there could be some leverage in that line. I'm wondering, if Q4 was a bit of anomaly maybe you accelerated some spending in the period, given the upside potential of the quarter, because you have that cushion, or whether we should reconsider the belief that there really is SG&A leverage as we move through 2016. I know that's a lot, but thanks.
Kevin Gordon
I would encourage you to continue believe that we will leverage SG&A more effectively. As we â I think Mike pointed out in his remarks, when you look at that SG&A percentage, bringing the joint venture together in the second half of the year in particular with the cost of implementing that and the incremental cost at the rate at which that the assets came in and the SG&A level that they had, addition to the cost of deals and then the incremental amortization expense that came along with that deal actually pop that up a little bit. As well as in Q4 I think we've talked a bit about the increased compensation expense.
So there was a bit of a true up in some of those things in the fourth quarter to get to base on the positive results that we had as a company. So, we continue to look for ways to leverage SG&A, and our expectation in the guidance that you'll see, Eric, is that SG&A as a percentage of revenue will continue to tick down.
Eric Coldwell
Okay. Great. And just to clarify that the 23.7% operating margin in PDT. Last quarter, you â I think you technically said, you expect to maintain or even improve upon that level. Did you mean off of the 23.7% or off a full year 2015? I'm just â it seems like a really big jump so.
Thomas Pike
Yeah. I would look at â I think, you look at the full year 2015, you obviously have to contemplate, as I know, you know very well, where currency is and everything that we're talking about is in relation to the currency raises as they exist at the beginning of this year. But certainly, we see the ability to continue to leverage that and perhaps improve slightly over that full year margin level.
Eric Coldwell
Perfect. Thanks so much.
Thomas Pike
Thanks, Eric.

And next is Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ricky Goldwasser
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So two parts to my question. First of all, you mentioned I think cancellations in the release, one of your competitorâs highlighted cancellations last week. So could you just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the marketplace? Is this kind of like normalized levels or you're seeing any increased pace that's associated with complexity of trials?
Second, going back to your comment that 41% of the studies are in the early stage. When we think about kind of like the longer time for trials to ramp that you started talking about in 2015, the trial that started [indiscernible] late 2014, first half of 2015, have they now all moved to the next phase. And now that you have that kind of like knowledge-base and history, should we think about kind of like the longer start-up time? Can you quantify how long does it take now, is it kind of like nine months longer, six months longer, 12 months longer, just that we have kind of a sense of thinking about how burn rates could look into the future?
Michael McDonnell
So, Ricky, Mike speaking. I'll take the first question on the cancellations. We don't disclose our actual rate of cancellation. But what I can say is, I will just remind you that the book-to-bill stats that we put out are net of cancellations. I think, overall, we were pleased with the results on new business for the quarter, and we did not see anything unusual in terms of cancellations during the fourth quarter.
Thomas Pike
And let me â and I'll start on your second â your second area there. It is interesting, I mean, again, you're referring â we talked about a year ago about how studies are extending a bit. And this is largely due to the complexity associated with them. As our competitors started talking about that, we're actually not seeing further extension. So, for us, we may have been early in that trend and now they're getting baked into the backlog in a somewhat normal way.
And I sometimes think of this like a whole bunch of trains leaving this station. They're all going to different destinations, some of them are short, some of them are long. There's an enormous amount of Phase II studies taking place right now, which are a little shorter in duration as well.
And so, I think the main message for us is that as you go through this enrollment period, this is when the revenues ramp up. And then at last patients in, then that become quite steady for the remainder of the study. And given the statistics as you described, the 41% early stages, we do see assuming continued new business win, we see this ability to ramp up our revenues associated with that. And then at some point, we'll get to a point where those are all in maintenance mode and hopefully there will be more new studies on top of those that keep us growing. So, I think it's a good place to be. And that's why Mike pointed out that we expect that Product Development growth to be about 10% for this year.
Ricky Goldwasser
Okay. Thank you.
Thomas Pike
Thank you, Ricky.
Operator
And next is the question from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.
Tim Evans
Thank you. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One, did I hear you say that the OpEx raise that you've assumed in guidance were at the beginning of January? And then the second question, you said you didn't see anything unusual in cancellations. Last quarter, you did elect to call out one customer that had restructured that you expected to see heavier cancellations in Q4. So I just wanted to see if you could square that up for us. Thanks.
Michael McDonnell
Yeah, Tim, it's Mike speaking. So correct on the FX point. The guidance assumes that we don't have further fluctuations in foreign currency beyond what was in place at the beginning of the year or rates that were at the place beginning of the year. And then as it relates to cancellation, I guess I would respond this way, the book-to-bill that we put out are net of cancellations. So if the spirit of the question is that we see, huge new business offset by large cancellations netting to the numbers that you saw. The short answer is, no. We had very normal activity relative to cancellation and really nothing that we would describe as unusually large or not out of the â or out of the ordinary.
Kevin Gordon
Yeah, Tim, I'll just add to that. This is Kevin. As you know, on the third quarter call, and as you alluded to, we did mention in the possibility of cancellations with a particular customer. At that time, we indicated that we expected the new business wins from that customer to exceed the amount that may have been cancelled as a result of some of the reprioritization that they were doing. And that indeed turned out appropriate and did occur in the fourth quarter. So we actually came out as a net positive in those net new business and the bookings that we had.
And beyond that, as Mike said, there is nothing unusual beyond that in terms of normal historical levels, which cancellations are a part of what we do. And we expect those to happen as a normal course. But everything that we had forecasted coming out of Q3 was very much in line with what occurred.
Tim Evans
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And our next questioner is Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Donald Hooker
Good morning. So I would imagine there was a lot of drug approvals over the past 18 months or so that it would be great for your contract sales organization and some of the pharma detailing. But I was wondering if there was any impact, negative impact perhaps from consolidation in the provider with hospitals and physician practices if that changes their policies around detailing new drugs and does that impact the CSO at all?
Thomas Pike
Yeah. It's a good question Donald, it's Tom. In general, what we're seeing is this movement toward multi-channel selling and we are in front of that as well. And so, that means that, what we need to do is contact physicians and be able to detail on a wide variety of ways. And so, our team is right at the forefront of that.
The other thing that we're doing is, more and more as these medications, they are more sophisticated and complex, there is the nursing element essentially sending a skilled nurse out to help a physician understand how to â basically how to do an infusion or how to properly administer that medication. And so, we're seeing continued growth in that segment of the business.
Again, I have to say with the CSO, unfortunately, it is just a lumpy business, but the backdrop as you say having the most [indiscernible], is very attractive.
Donald Hooker
Thank you.
Operator
And next we have a question from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Garen Sarafian
Good morning, Tom and Kevin, and welcome Mike. My question was revolving â revolves around the top-line growth across both your segment. So in IHS organic growth, we expect Encore was volatile, but I think your guidance of low-single digits is at the bottom, near the lower end of the organic growth rates in 2015. Is that right and how should we sort of think about this segment?
And on the Product Development side, I thought that you had some projects in place to accelerate the development of the trials in the ramp up stage. So, I am just wondering, the acceleration that you're seeing in burn rate, how much of that was due to your internal efforts or is it just the natural course of the project that took place. So, just trying to get an idea of, is more complex trials came through again next year, are you differently position versus this past year?
Thomas Pike
Yeah, let me start on that and Kevin may add to this. Interestingly, we have started to put those practices in the fourth quarter, and it's very difficult to attribute. And this is around the Product Development burn rates. And it's difficult to attribute a specific number to it. But I do think the disciplines that we're seeing are starting to show results and give us some confidence as we go into the next year.
So, I appreciate that you're bringing that back up and shining a light on it, because we're pretty excited about what our management team is doing over there. It's good for patients, good for customers and good for shareholders, we can accelerate that $12 billion backlog.
Kevin, I just add a few more comments, but I look back at last year in Q1 and Q2 respectively, we grew 29.3% and 23% associated with IHS, and so those are tough comps. And where â you should see some improvement towards the back half of the year, but those are pretty tough comps and so you see that, that low single digit. And we're always conscious of exactly how we say it, but basically low single-digit growth associated with IHS in 2016.
Kevin Gordon
Yeah. I would just add on, Garen, to your question around, is it just a natural function of the trials, et cetera. Clearly, we have more trials coming in, you've heard us talk about that in terms of the mix. We've had really positive mix of net new business towards the clinical side of the business throughout what we've been winning in the past few quarters, which influences that ability to grow in those, what we would consider to be the higher margin areas of the business as well. So I think that's very positive, coupled with the efforts we're making around, as I mentioned earlier, prime and partner sites, the use of data and feasibility and so forth to really improve in those complex areas, how we're getting things started up. So I think that's really contributing nicely on both sides of your question.
And then, Tom did refer to IHS the tough comps coming into the year, as much as I hate to use this, in third quarter, we did talk about an impact from a potential item in that quarter. I'm reluctantly trying to find a way not to say the word cancellation, but it does have a bit of an impact, particularly, in the first half of the year, next year in IHS, and that's getting us into the low single digits. I think the previous question around the strength of the new product launches particularly in the U.S. I think does provide some visibility to some nice opportunities that will exist for that business.
Garen Sarafian
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And the next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.
Tycho Peterson
Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a two part question here. On Product Development operating margins, what was the FX impact for the full year? It looks like you guys improved operating margin there by about 160 bps. So how much of that was FX? And secondly, I mean, in terms of the IHS cancellation that you've just mentioned and the tough comp, is it fair to assume that you basically have flat growth there for the first half of the year with kind of like mid-to-high-single digits growth in the back half?
Michael McDonnell
If you take the margins stat, if you â if that's [indiscernible] on that one. I think, on Product Development I think the spirit of your question is around margin improvement. And what we said in the opening remarks is that we saw a 200 basis point of improvement about a 190 basis point of that was foreign exchange benefits.
Thomas Pike
Yeah. And maybe...
Tycho Peterson
Yeah. I was actually asking for the full-year?
Michael McDonnell
That is also for the full-year.
Tycho Peterson
Okay.
Michael McDonnell
Yeah. The full-year it was about 100 â yeah, the full-year, what we said was that it was a 160 basis points of margin improvement with about 190 basis points from favorable currency, and there was a modest decline related to the ramp of the GDN and some of the other investments that we're making.
Tycho Peterson
Got it.
Thomas Pike
Yeah. And I think â since we're overtime I'll just take the other half of your question, and say, we're really pleased with the margin expansion that we've had that really reflects our operating model and in the Product Development side. I think we go into this year, feeling good about where we are in terms of studies, where we are in terms of backlog. And currency is currency, but we have a terrific operating model to deliver results.
And on the IHS side, again, as we were talking about actually we think â all things considered given the tough comps, it's very â it's a strong year for IHS too and we'll see some acceleration as we go into the second half of the year, as we get past these tough comps. So, overall, I think, if you look at our book-to-bills this year, you look at book-to-bills this quarter, you look at the $12 billion of backlog, in this environment that we have right now, we feel like we're a great house and a good neighborhood.
Tycho Peterson
Awesome. Thanks.
