On behalf of Quintiles, hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Patricia, and I will be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan
Thank you, Patricia. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com\investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2013 annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2014.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Karl, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings call.
Let's begin on Slide 3 with a few highlights. I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong performance across both of our operating segments. We delivered over $1.1 billion of services revenues, representing 13.8% growth compared to the same period last year. Our Integrated Healthcare Services segment contributed 32.6% service revenue growth on the back of the strong new business wins from the prior 4 quarters and a contribution from the Encore acquisition, which we completed in July.
On a consolidated basis, our EPS grew 22.6% compared to the same period last year. On the net new business front, we recorded $1.51 billion in the quarter, a 12.8% growth compared to the prior year quarter. This represents a book-to-bill ratio of 1.42x services revenues in the quarter. $27 billion (sic) [$1.27 billion] of net new business representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.64x in the quarter. The net new business increased 47% compared to the same period in 2013. This included our wide variety of services and customers and included the renewal of a clinical and data management functional resourcing contract for services to be provided over a duration comparable to our longer clinical trials.
Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio in the Product Development segment is 1.32.
Within our Integrated Healthcare Services segment, we booked $244 million of net new business, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.84. As we've said before, the commercial business within this segment can be lumpy throughout the year. While we continue to see strong demand for our services in this business, the timing of award and launches can vary, and renewals within this business are typically booked toward the end of the year.
We have continued to see strength in the real-world, late phase business, where we have significant differentiation and remain bullish on the market trends. Importantly, over the last 12 months, the book-to-bill ratio in the IHS segment is 1.20, above our historical averages.
Our industry-leading backlog increased in the quarter, finishing at nearly $10.75 billion. Within the backlog, we maintained a highly-diversified customer portfolio, with over 500 pharmaceutical customers working across many different therapeutic areas.
We believe the diversity of our customer portfolio, together with our therapeutic breadth, are the key to us achieving our goal of delivering consistent long-term performance.
Now let me hand over to Kevin, who will provide greater detail on the financial results.
Kevin K. Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Taking a look at Slide 4, I'll begin with the consolidated results.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2014, our consolidated service revenues grew 13.8% at actual foreign exchange rates and 14% in constant currency. We finished the quarter with $1.061 billion of service revenues compared to $932.7 million in the comparable prior year quarter.
As a result of the strong IHS North America and Novella revenue contributions, the global mix of our service revenues has shifted slightly from the prior year, with the North America and Latin America region up slightly to 43%, the Europe, Middle East and Africa region down slightly to 36% and the Asia Pacific region was consistent at 21% of the total.
Compared with the prior year third quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 13.9% to $150.9 million, a margin of 14.2%, with a 10 basis point benefit from foreign currency exchange impacts. Margins improved in both segments in the quarter at constant currency. However, with the higher unallocated corporate costs and an increase in revenue mix from the IHS segment, the consolidated operating margins remain equivalent to the prior year quarter. More on each segment in a moment.
For the third quarter, SG&A of $219 million was 20.6% of service revenues compared to $199.6 million or 21.4% of service revenues in the prior year. The dollar increase was due to the addition of Novella and Encore and increases in share-based compensation expense offset by our continued focus to leverage SG&A infrastructure as a percentage of revenue.
We recognized $1.8 million of net restructuring charges during the third quarter in connection with previously announced and approved restructuring plans.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 31.1% during the quarter compared to 29.1% for the same period last year. The increase in the rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of profit delivered in the United States compared to the prior year.
Adjusted net income grew 20.2% to $85 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Contributing to the adjusted net income growth were the increased service revenues, improved operating margins in both segments and $3.7 million less interest expense due to lower interest rates offset by the increase in the effective income tax rate compared to the same period last year.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 22.6% to $0.65 per share in the third quarter compared to $0.53 per share in the same period in the prior year.
During the quarter, the company began excluding from the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share changes from adjustments of contingent consideration related to business combinations as we believe these changes are not indicative of the core operating results of the company. As such, an adjustment of $8.8 million equaling $0.07 of GAAP earnings per share was made in the current period, and an adjustment of $1.2 million or $0.01 of GAAP earnings per share was made for the comparable period last year. The adjustments reduced adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in both periods. Included on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation is a table which conforms previously reported 2013 quarterly non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted earnings.
Our cash balance was $645 million as of the end of the quarter, of which $203 million was in the U.S. Cash provided by operations was $175.8 million in the first 9 months of 2014 compared to $177.9 million provided for the same period in 2013.
The decrease in operating cash flow reflects an increase in payments for taxes and less cash received from upfront payments under customer contacts, partially offset by lower cash paid for interest. In addition, the first 9 months of 2013 included cash expenses totaling $32.5 million for fees paid in connection with the termination or amendment of certain agreements.
Capital expenditures were $57.8 million in the first 9 months of this year compared to $73.9 million during the same period in 2013. And our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at September 30, 2014, was $1.4 billion compared to $1.27 billion at the end of December 2013.
Turning to our segments, we'll move to Slide 5. The Product Development segment accounted for 73% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 27% for the quarter, a 300 basis point greater contribution from IHS compared with the same period in 2013 due to the strong revenue growth in this segment. Product Development's revenue grew 8% at actual rates to $771.4 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. At constant currency exchange rate, the segment service revenues grew 7.9%.
Third quarter service revenue growth resulted from an increase in services provided on a functional basis, growth in clinical trial support services, volume increases in our global lab business and an incremental contribution from the Novella acquisition of $25.3 million.
In addition, as we've mentioned previously, the largest clinical project in our history concluded at the end of 2013, creating a 420 basis point revenue headwind in the Product Development segment during the quarter compared with 2013.
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $158.2 million, representing 12.5% growth at actual rates, and income from operations margin was 20.5% in the quarter. Margins improved 80 basis points, of which 50 basis points came from the leverage of global overheads, with the remaining 30 basis points from positive foreign exchange benefits.
IHS service revenues increased by 32.6% or $71.1 million to $289.6 million in the third quarter, of which $19.2 million was from the Encore acquisition. At constant foreign exchange rate, service revenues increased 33.9% compared to the same period last year. The increase in service revenues for the quarter in the IHS segment were from commercial North America and Japan, from the recent strong bookings, a continuation of very strong growth in our real-world and late phase research unit and from Encore.
IHS income from operations for the third quarter was $19.9 million, including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $1.2 million. IHS income from operations grew 81% at constant currency rates and 70.5% at actual foreign exchange rates. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 7.2% at constant currency rates and 6.9% at actual foreign exchange rates.
At actual rates, margins improved 160 basis points, of which 190 basis points came primarily from the leverage of global overheads offset by 30 basis points from negative foreign currency exchange impacts. The strength in the margin also included a third quarter seasonality benefit from the commercial business, which was consistent with a similar benefit experienced in the third quarter of the prior year.
So in summary, our third quarter 2014 results continue the trend of consistent performance in Product Development and a more profitable return to growth in our IHS segment. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is equal or exceed 1.2x service revenues in both segments. We recorded solid revenue growth despite the difficult prior year compare from completing our largest clinical project ever in 2013, and we improved our operating margins in both segments.
Now turning to Slide 6 and our 2014 guidance update. The guidance we provided during our second quarter 2014 earnings call was based on foreign currency exchange rates at June 30, 2014. Because of significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates after that date, 2014 service revenues are estimated to be approximately $40 million less than prior guidance, of which the third quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $10 million. Although the currency changes are expected to impact the reported revenues, we do not expect any significant impact to the adjusted EPS.
Thus, we are now estimating service revenues between $4.16 billion and $4.19 billion, representing growth of 9.2% to 10% at our assumed exchange rates. We are also raising our diluted adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $2.61 and $2.68 per share, representing growth of 26.7% to 30.1%, with diluted GAAP earnings per share also between $2.61 and $2.68 per share.
We continue to expect our annual effective income tax rate will be approximately 30%.
Importantly, these estimates assume the end of September 2014 foreign currency exchange rates and do not reflect the impact of any potential future share repurchases pursuant to our 2013 equity repurchase program, under which $59.5 million remains available.
I'll now turn it back to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Kevin. Now turning to Slide 7. Our Product Development book-to-bill of 1.64 is the highlight of this quarter, which included a large renewal for clinical and data management functional services. In addition, we did another smaller sole-source deal with a midsized pharmaceutical company that we will not name.
At this time, that relationship contributes limited new business, but it is an important relationship for the future. It demonstrates that there are some deals that Quintiles can do that are difficult or even impossible for our competitors. These are deals of scale, deals that require diversity of capabilities, deals that require deep therapeutic skills, globality and our advisory capability.
As you would probably agree, the development world we service today is much more complex than ever before. We continue to see greater precision of therapies, creating more complex trials with clinically meaningful outcomes and driven by reimbursement.
A study performed by Tufts recently compared the change in certain development design criteria from 2002 to 2012. Some of what they found was the total number of endpoints have increased by 185%, the total number of procedures have increased by 157%, the number of investigative sites have increased by 158%. However, the total number of patients who are randomized around trials have decreased by about 82%.
The net is that trial complexities and the mixture of projects results in a diverse backlog that may have more protocol amendments and a diversity of durations. However, we feel we're best positioned to deal with this complexity by leveraging our therapeutic expertise, scale, technology and innovative development models. We have the largest backlog, and it bodes well for long-term revenue visibility.
During this past week, I met with a number of very senior executives at our customers. I believe based on those discussions and others plus the pipeline of deals that we see that an advantage continues to accrue to the larger CROs and Quintiles in particular. The deals increasingly integrate a level of technology and certainly, the ability to monitor and do administration from low-cost locations. Of course, we are the leaders in technology. We have largest global workforce in our industry. Our business model is different, and we can continue to lead.
That said, biotech funding is also alive and well, with 30% year-on-year growth for the third quarter and 39% year-to-date growth in 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year. You might have seen that we doubled down, with an announcement on September 12, a new set of service offerings specifically focused on emerging biopharma.
One therapeutic area in the Product Development segment we're showing leadership is infectious disease. In addition to some pioneering work in the rotavirus in India and with dengue in the developing world, we recently were awarded some important work on Ebola. In fact, you may have seen our Chief Medical Officer discussing the situation and clinical development for Ebola on CNBC last week, once again showing our leadership.
On the Integrated Healthcare Services side, we still see solid demand. Our star over there is the real-world, late phase business, which continues to be our fastest-growing business unit. In fact, their challenge is dealing with the rapid growth. They benefit greatly from being attached to a company with such a vast infrastructure. There is general agreement in the industry that approvals are likely to incorporate a greater amount of real-world monitoring. In addition, we see more companies wanting to understand what's happening in the real practice of medicine around their compounds and their introduction of products. Essentially, the size of many registries can be as much as 10x larger than in the past comparable to many good-sized clinical trials. Over the longer term, real-world, late phase will continue to focus on electronic medical record data. That is where our acquisition of Encore gives us another competitive advantage.
The commercial business, the new business tends to be lumpy. But in the United States, the NME approvals continue to be strong, with 29 NMEs approved in the first 9 months of 2014 compared to 16 in the first 9 months of the prior year. The Japanese market is strong as well. We think this bodes well for the commercial business over the longer term.
We're also pleased this quarter to have our first Analyst Day, where we had a number of our top executives profile each of their business areas. During that week, we also demonstrated some of our technologies, provided insights into our rich inventory of data and how we couple these assets together to drive insights to efficiently design and efficiently deliver quality clinical trials, which, in turn, delivers values to our customers and differentiates us.
As a final general point, Kevin and I continue to drive programs here to improve margins and profitability. We're pleased to continue to show margin improvement in both business units. We're pushing things further, given our scale, and to keep improving our productivity in both operations and SG&A so that we can remain price-competitive and create more value for you, the shareholders.
We're happy with the first 9 months, and here's a few points in summary. IHS returned to growth, with 18.9% growth at constant currency in the first 9 months of the year while improving profitability. Product Development continues to execute, with a focus on providing the industry-leading portfolio of solutions to our customers while improving our best-in-class adjusted income from operations margin.
We generated total company net new business growth of 11.5% and increased our industry-leading backlog to $10.75 billion, with no customer accounting for more than 10% of our consolidated services revenues.
We've improved our operating margins at both segments at constant currency rates, with a focus on leveraging that global infrastructure and scale. And our diluted EPS growth was 31.1%, driven from our revenue growth, operational productivity, leverage of SG&A and capital structuring strategies. Of course, we've had a number of awards this quarter. A few of them were that we were awarded the 2014 CRO Eagle Award for the second consecutive year from the Society of Clinical Research Sites. This award reflects the opinions of 2,000-plus investigative sites across the globe. We were ranked the #1 CSO of choice in the U.K., as selected by the readers of Pharmaceutical Field for the 12th year in a row. And Encore, our acquisition, was ranked in the top 10 of Modern Healthcare's best places to work in health care. These awards and recognition demonstrate our commitment to our patients, the investigator community, our customers and to society, where we bring people and knowledge together for a healthier world.
In closing, we're pleased with the quarter, feel well positioned to continue to execute against our strategic priorities in the remainder of this year and beyond. I'd like to recognize and thank the now 32,000-plus employees at Quintiles for their dedication to improving health care for the betterment of our society.
Now let me turn the call back to Karl to begin the Q&A session.
Karl Deonanan
Thanks, Tom. We are ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, you may now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I guess limiting my question to purely one. You guys had a very solid net book-to-bill ratio, even though one of your peers recently just stated seeing some delays in partnership trials and elongated decision cycles. So could you just elaborate a little bit more as to what you're seeing overall in the market the past few months? And is there any specific segments of the market that's showing more or less strength, where your -- perhaps your mix is a little bit different than others that make Quintiles more unique? Any more color would be appreciated.
Thomas H. Pike
Sure. We -- this is Tom, Garen. We always assess what's going on with our pipeline and what's going on in the market broadly. And I think, in general, we feel that it's consistent throughout the last probably 4 or 5 quarters, where there's strong demand for clinical services, solid demand for IHS services throughout the world. And so from our vantage point, there's no fundamental changes in the number of RFPs we're seeing, and we continue to have those senior management discussions that indicate that our customers are seeking innovative new ways to reduce development costs, improve productivity, improve outcomes. So in general, we don't see any fundamental change in terms of what we see.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Tom, in the prepared remark, you talked about the sole-source contract that you recently signed in the quarter. Can you just give a little bit more color on -- around how many other CROs competed for this business and is this a sponsor that you previously had a relationship with? And if this kind of -- and when you think longer term, is this part of trend where we're going to see sponsors moving from maybe preferred providers to sole-source?
Thomas H. Pike
Thanks, Ricky. This is an interesting one because this was a prior customer who traditionally did compete their bids and then decided -- started working with us and working with our advisory organization and then decided it was just simply more efficient for them to work with only us. They felt that they got the -- a pricing effectiveness. So in general, the prices could be benchmarked so they'd know that they wouldn't be losing anything on price by working just with us. But they also felt that the increasingly intimate knowledge of their therapeutic areas, how they work was more beneficial than bidding projects out. And I think, in light of the changes taking place, what it lets us do with this type of organization is it really lets them help make change happen. If you think about it, if you bid your contracts out to 3 or 4 different CROs, then you have 3 or 4 different organizations to manage, 3 or 4 different sets of SOPs. Whereas if you just work with us, you can leverage our technology, our SOPs, globally, our therapeutic areas. You may not have to build in-house therapeutic capabilities and a new indication until you know that, that indication is going to prove appropriate for your compound. So I have to say, I think this is a trend. And I've even had some -- we tend to see it, as you know, in the what we tend to call mid-cap pharma, which can be pretty large these days. But we're -- there has even been a few discussions at very senior levels of some of the largest pharmaceutical firms of the interest in whether this is possible to do with them. So I do think it's a general trend. I think it bodes well. Small biopharma remains strong for us, too, and so you're really seeing a bit of a -- it's just a good time in the industry because you've got that growth in small biopharma, which, frankly, is interested in the breadth and depth of our capabilities. So they don't have to build much development capability at all. And then the larger biopharma is more interested in the transition capabilities that we bring in terms of reengineering how development works.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Tom, you addressed part of this with Garen's question, but I'm -- the one thing you didn't mention in the response to him was a commentary on RFP cycle times. And then also, I'm just -- I'm curious if you can give us any sense -- if I missed it, I'm sorry. But if you can give us any sense on the impact of that one large win and what your book to bill might have been absent that one large long-term contract.
Thomas H. Pike
Interestingly, no real impact on cycle times. So that's -- we're very close as a management team to the sales, obviously. And in particular, nothing new for us in terms of decision cycles. It continues to be consistent. We can't really talk about the particular impact of that functional resourcing renewal. But what I think we can say is -- what's interesting about it is it's quite strategic because it involves data management, it involves some of the most sophisticated risk-based monitoring. In fact, I believe it might be the most sophisticated risk-based monitoring going on in the industry, and that is in-practice in theory. And so we're really pleased. And I think for investors, if you think about the revenue visibility that gets created with long-term contracts like that, it's just terrific. But overall, our pipeline continues to be strong. We had a particularly good one when you add the renewal to our other business in terms of this quarter. And we're pretty pleased with it, Eric, in terms of how this has worked out from a new business standpoint.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
My question is for Kevin. Kevin, can you just remind us about the differing cost structures between product development and IHS that drove the -- I believe you said an FX benefit for Product Development but an FX headwind for IHS in the quarter.
Kevin K. Gordon
Sure, John. I think you can see some of that. It's not solely the cost. It's where the revenue is contracted. So even in the slide deck, you'll see a deck in there that indicates about 64% of our revenues are contracted in U.S. dollars that were delivered and then the major currencies that are also there. So as you contract more and more in that U.S. dollar base, it's important. And then we have a cost structure that, in many areas, is not matched as well to that dollar. So for instance, we do very well and are very well matched in Japan, for instance, where you saw the significant strength of the dollar against the yen. In the -- for the most part, in our IHS business, we have a matched revenue and cost structure in IHS. However, given the global nature of the Product Development business, and a significant portion of those revenues contracted in U.S. dollars to the extent we're doing work in countries like Japan or even for that matter, throughout Europe these days, with -- where the euro is positioned, we actually get a benefit. And that benefit tends to attrit more to the Product Development segment than IHS.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.
Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division
Maybe turning on the tuck-in acquisition front. I mean, you guys have been relatively active in the last 12, 18 months. Can you maybe just give us -- I know you talked about briefly Encore, some of -- update on how some of the other pieces have tracked in Novella, Advion, et cetera, relative to expectation and where you feel like you're getting the kind of best return on invested capital relative to the various ones you've done more medium term.
Thomas H. Pike
I think the -- I'll start and then Kevin can add to it. I -- the 2 that stand out in front for us from a financial return and probably industry impact standpoint are our acquisition of the Outcome Sciences business a few years ago and then the Novella acquisition. Both of these have contributed very meaningfully to our service mix and to the ability to integrate services, so there's real cross-selling that's possible associated with them. And then they're contributing meaningful to new bookings and revenue. What's interesting about Novella, just to give a sense, I just did a reference call for a small customer the other day and we were chatting about this. As you take an organization like Novella, these acquisitions, they tend to start primarily U.S.-focused. To able to serve their customer base, they need more globality, they need better data management, more technology. And so we literally are able to plug Novella into our overall infrastructure, lower their cost of delivery a little bit and give them improved capabilities. And I think you'd find the same thing in the real-world, late phase business. We're still pleased with the acquisitions like EA. I think EA gives us a capability in personalized medicine that is not matched by our competition. We feel pretty strongly that with what's happening and particular -- and particularly in oncology and the huge drive to have therapies that are based on genetic mutations. And then, actually, EA's leadership position in RNA sequencing, which is becoming another enormous part of the therapeutic revolution going on there, that, that is giving us an ability to do Phase I, Phase II trials and provide both technical support as well as traditional logistical support to the trials. So we're pleased with that, although, in all candor, it's not as much of a revenue contributor. It doesn't have the kind of revenue impact we've seen in the other 2. So does that help, Ross, in terms of -- and by the way, I think, in general, we believe that we can continue to do that. And we continue to be on the lookout for those because I think we're pretty good at taking them in and putting them under our wing and trying to get the most out of them.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
So Tom, there's been a fairly stark contrast in new business wins this quarter amongst the clinical providers, at least, that have reported so far. I guess just asking Eric's question a different way. How would you recognize this 5-year renewal into bookings and ultimately, into backlog? And then if I go back to your comments around seeing the same level of RFPs, are you maybe seeing a higher hit rate that might help explain your view that you are, in fact, taking market share amongst the clinical providers?
Thomas H. Pike
Let me start with the second one that -- in terms of hit rate, and then maybe Kevin can help with the backlog, although he may end up saying things similar to what I'd say. The -- our general hit rate is consistent with RFPs over time, so -- just in terms of that specific question. So we've got a good volume of them. I've said to you guys before, I believe we're the best in the business at flushing them out. We just have a very strong sales organization, so we flush out the big and small. We have the dedicated people at the larger accounts that work and really develop deep relationships at various levels of the customers, which, again, is often not matched by our competition. So I think we just find a lot, and the general hit rate is consistent with prior quarters in terms of what we do. I don't know, Kevin, I...
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. I think that's right. If you look at the metrics around hit, what we call our hit and our strike rate, they're relatively consistent coming through the first 9 months of the year. So I don't think there's any significant change in that. Certainly, the mix is a little different coming to the third quarter, as you heard us say, with our renewal of a contract. It is in the functional resourcing area, both across data management, monitoring, et cetera. It is a 5-year contract, as you noted in the press release. So it does burn into revenue over that period of time, but it is a very, very important contract that we have today. And our ability to extend that into the future and actually expand it to a certain extent as we look forward was very good -- were very good in the quarter, but not necessarily reflective of a strike or hit rate differential. And in most cases, it's very similar to what we see in terms of the type of contract in that functional area. So a continuation of good business that we have with an important customer.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland with Piper Jaffray.
Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
So with respect to the Encore acquisition, I'd like to know if this is after you're done -- after this call, I assume it's going to be buried in the number and so we're not going to hear much [indiscernible] about it. But where do we expect to see the benefits of Encore show up in your financial results? Is it through lower costs? Is it through a greater competitive advantage on the book to bill? And what EHR company specifically are you working with today?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes. Encore, in general -- and just to remind folks, if you look at the way our business is unfolding, our vision and our approach is really to be involved from first-in-man through the practice of medicine with this focus on pharmaceuticals. And so if you look at what's happening in the pharmaceutical firms, there is an intense focus on what's going on in the real world in terms of the practice of medicine. So if you have a diabetes drug, what you want to understand is when does that doctor make the decision, why does that doctor make the decision to switch to your product versus remaining on the standard of care or existing regimen. So you can really understand things. What -- clearly, the registries that we do in the real-world, late phase area are very important in today's world, where electronic medical records are not consistent between different providers. But what's coming is real consistency around those electronic medical records and the ability to actually use those electronic medical records to understand the practice of medicine. And so if you look at what we did with Encore, Encore is really a leader associated with electronic medical record technology. They have developed a series of tools to be able to look at them. They're very involved in helping hospitals deal with meaningful use rules. They're on the verge of population management in terms of the understanding of the data. And so if you look for us at the strategic play, our real-world, late phase business, our fastest-growing piece, is increasingly looking at real electronic health record, electronic medical record data, to be able to understand what's happening. And so Encore gives us a leg up in that. They certainly center on Epic and Cerner as those are the largest providers. But then they have capabilities across the spectrum as well. And we're already doing some really exciting collaborations with a couple of their customers around utilizing electronic medical records to better understand these practice patterns that can be helpful to pharmaceutical firms. So we're pretty excited about that piece. So I hope -- that's kind of a long explanation, but I think you can see, very strategically relevant for us. And I think in terms of the contribution, what I'm hoping you'll see is revenue and margin contribution over time coming out of that business primarily centered on the IHS side.

Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
A question on IHS. You called out that the trailing 12-month book to bill remains healthy, and it certainly does. You did see a little bit of a downtick this quarter. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the -- does that change your prior comments about a strong kind of back half of the year for IHS of higher revenue conversion. And then if you could also maybe just touch on the margin expansion opportunity. You spent a lot of time at the Analyst Day talking about some of the higher-margin services for IHS. So how should we think about margins progressing in IHS as well?
Thomas H. Pike
Do you want to go ahead, Kevin?
Kevin K. Gordon
Sure, Tycho. Clearly, as we've always said, and I think Tom actually said in his remarks, around the new business side particularly in commercial can be a bit bumpy up and down quarter-to-quarter. But in general, pretty strong. The fact that the book to bill in Q3 does not impact our view at all in terms of the strength that we'll see through Q4 to fill out the back half of the year from a revenue perspective. We still -- as you can see that I think in our guidance, see in -- the change in guidance was predominantly related to the currency impact. But good strength in the second half of the year is certainly expected. And your second question, remind me again.
Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just on the margin opportunity. I mean, you did spend time at the Analyst Day talking about higher-margin services for IHS. So when do we start to see those kind of falling through?
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. Certainly, as I mentioned, I think third quarter tends to be a very strong quarter for us from a margin standpoint. You saw that last year. You saw that come through again this year, really, really good margins. And a lot of that, again, was some of the leverage and some of the timing of that. As we moderate through the fourth quarter, I would expect margins more in that segment to moderate back close to where they've been or where they were in the last year. But we do have significant opportunities, as we talked about of Analyst Day, of gaining leverage across that structure, which you started to see some of that in the third quarter. As some of those new services come on, particularly the strength in real-world, late phase and some of the new services in the IHS segment, we do still expect our margin improvement to come through as we go into the next couple of years.
Thomas H. Pike
And maybe I'll just add a point. It's -- what's interesting about the 2 major chunks of that, the CSO business tends to get this broad SG&A leverage, so they're able to grow with very little incremental cost. And then on the real-world, late phase side, it's a little bit more like the clinical business just in terms of that it does take people to deliver some of that revenue. And so what we're finding is the growth is so fast in real-world, late phase that our ability to get short-term margin expansion is limited. But as you go over the longer term, what you can imagine is, once we get past the start-up phase of these mega registries and things that we're doing, then we would expect that expansion to come. I think as we get into 2015, we'll look a little bit more at the exact timing of that expansion that we'd see. But given that growth, our general feeling, Tycho, is we want to continue to capture share there because these mega registries are something relatively new. We're the best at it. And we just feel like we ought to go ahead and take those corner lots, if you will, to use the retailing analogy, while they're out there before they're all gone.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Hoping to wrap a follow-up together here. I'm wondering, first of all, broadly, on bookings, could you speak to the pricing environment? You've talked about the robust RFP flows. I just want to get a sense of pricing environment. And then specifically in Integrated Health, the bookings that you've seen have kind of bucked the normal seasonal trend and curious about whether we should expect the fourth quarter and into 2015 to kind of resume the normal seasonal trend. Or are we in a different environment here?
Thomas H. Pike
Let me -- I will start with the pricing. And the -- interestingly, I think the pricing remains generally consistent. So we haven't -- we have talked from time to time about irrational pricing taking place in the business. I don't think we see that. We do see that some of the private competitors may be pricing [indiscernible] from time to time, so we'll see a little bit of that stuff in terms of them filling their pipelines. But I'd say, overall, it's pretty consistent with what we've seen. And we do expect -- to your latter point in terms of commercial, we have seen -- I think for everyone on the call, what Dave is referring to is you tend to see a little bit of seasonality in the fourth quarter in the commercial business because they tend to renew as the pharmaceutical firms look at their budgets, and we do expect that to be consistent with prior years. So the things that we've won during the course of the years have been new rather than renewals in general.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with Raymond James.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Tom, you kind of pointed to increase in trial complexity and rise in a number of protocol amendments. Obviously, Infosario Design would address some of those issues, and it is an area where largely it's in-sourced today. So I was wondering if you could provide us an update as to any headwinds -- any progress you're making on that front.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I'm glad. It's always great when you guys bring up one of our tools like Infosario Design. And for folks on the call, this is the piece of software we developed with a pharmaceutical firm that lets you visualize a clinical trial used data, electronic health record and other data from both us, from third parties and from our pharmaceutical partners to visualize how to do a clinical trial more efficiently, where the pockets of patients are, what's likely to have been associated with screening rates, et cetera. And so this tool is unique. It fits very well with some things like Medidata Designer, which is actually a little more tactical tool for planning, and let's you do the high-end stuff. Interestingly, when you use the tool, what we is dramatic reduction in the number of protocol amendments. That being said -- unfortunately, not enough of our customers are using it. Maybe not enough in the industry is using that tool yet. So we are still seeing -- given the trial complexity and what the Tufts study highlighted, we do see in the beginning of these trials quite a lot of machinations associated with protocol amendments and start-up and site selection. And so I think like others, you can see some of these projects taking a little longer to get started than you might have seen in the past. The thing that I would say in general is it's great to have the backlog we have because we know it'll come. It's just a matter of exactly when it comes. And so if you really do value a company based on future earnings, all of that is there for you. But the other thing that Kevin and I have talked about a little bit recently is we -- over time, we may need start looking at our backlog in a little bit of layers because there's a little difference between some of the things going on in the backlog now than there might have been in the simpler business of a decade ago. So we're -- we were deep, and we're very good at analyzing our backlog. And we just need to understand it based on that type of work that's in that backlog to make sure that we can provide good guidance.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask one more follow-up on the FSP contract. Just to be clear, you're booking the entire duration of the contract, the multiyear duration of the contract this quarter? And if that is correct, what effect do you expect that to have on your backlog burn rate?
Kevin K. Gordon
You're absolutely right. It all got booked this quarter based -- for the 5-year period, Tim. And clearly, as we've stated, if you look at our average Product Development clinical trial today, it averages 50 to 53 months, more closely to 53 months, on an average duration. So if you look at this FSP contract in that context, it's pretty similar to some of our larger or our average clinical trial.

Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
So the -- just talk a little bit about I think sort of how you see FX rolling through the -- you've had some benefit this year to the margin. How -- does this sort of roll off in 2015? Are you going to be able to offset that? I just sort of wanted a little bit of color on sort of how we should think about margin progression in the next year.
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. Well, clearly, the way currency changes these days and as quickly as it's changing, it would be very difficult for me to necessarily predict exactly what's going to happen next year. So we're obviously working through that as we work through our budgeting process and our analysis. But if you just look at what's happened over the course of this year -- and I think we've laid that out for you pretty transparently on Slide 9 of the deck that we've given you. If you look at currency exchange impact in the third quarter, on a consolidated basis, it impacted our revenues less than $2 million and impacted our adjusted income from operations $1 million. So it didn't have a huge impact on a consolidated basis. To the question that John asked earlier, though, about mix, it's actually a positive contribution into Product Development and negative impact in IHS segment. So the strengthening dollar would work more so against the revenue line, thus the change in our guidance in that as the dollar strengthens and 40 -- nearly 40% of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, it will have an impact from that perspective. However, as I mentioned earlier, on the cost side, given that we generally deliver more than 40% of our -- or more than 60% of our service revenues outside of the U.S., we do get a benefit from a weaker -- the weaker currencies from a cost structure standpoint. So it's really variant between segment, and it's variant between where the work is performed in relation to that contracted dollar. So as we took our second half outlook that we shared today and where we were just 3 months ago or 4 months ago or 3 months ago when we talked about this, it had an impact from a revenue perspective with that significant change in the dollar strength of about $40 million on the revenue.

Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with SunTrust.
Alexander Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I know we've got a lot of calls going on this morning. But maybe, Tom, and this may sound like a fairly obvious question. Because we're hearing a lot about the -- as you said, the bigger players are looking more and more towards the larger CROs. And I'm just curious, in your recent conversations, what specifically is so attractive about the larger CROs to the customers? And is it anything different? I mean, are you guys bringing anything to the table differently today than maybe 3 years ago, maybe just because you can run a global trial? Is there something else about being big that's changing now? Just any additional color on that would be great.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, it's -- definitely. So in general and, again, you're always -- I always like to say "you're a product of your most recent experiences". So just in the last couple of weeks, I've had a number of very useful senior discussions on this exact topic. It really is some combination of our -- the ability to deal with the complexity of these trials as they -- as each of the compounds is getting more complex, it isn't simply providing a monitor anymore. It's really making sure that you design well. If you think about things like rare diseases, it's being able to find patients, which is challenging for a rare disease. If you think about a thing like biosimilars, there is a huge push on biosimilars. So having some scale to be able to deal with people who haven't previously had the antigens, for instance, in early phase, having the scale to be able to deal with that. So there's just a whole lot of factors that come to scale and effective pricing. But then the thing I would add in is increasingly, and I often make the analogy to the payroll industry, how you rarely pick a payroll provider and don't use their software. And in -- the same thing is tending to happen in our business, where they are tending to say, "Can you just bring a turnkey set of systems to us?" And then finally, one other trend that encourages this is there's been some discussion in the industry around risk-based monitoring. And that if you do risk-based monitoring, which, again, for the broader crowd, really means that you use data real-time that's coming out of the clinical trial to decide where you'll put your resources to confirm what is going on at investigative sites. If you're using risk-based monitoring, there's some question being called if you have many, many different companies doing that monitoring, whether it's going to be the same quality as having one or a couple of throats to choke. And so these things, in a world where -- you just have to watch the results of our friends in pharmaceutical. I mean, these are very good executives who continue to be challenged by the cost of R&D. And if you look at the pressures they are under, they're looking for solutions, and the larger CROs and Quintiles in particular can create and deliver solutions for these guys to some of their R&D cost and time challenges. I hope that helps.

Your next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker with KeyBanc.
Donald Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
So I guess most of the big questions have been asked. I'll ask a real simple one. I don't think you all commented around cancellation rates. And I think last quarter, you mentioned there was a large one that kind of impacted the net new business. Can you maybe describe cancellation trends through September?
Thomas H. Pike
Don, yes. Cancellations in the quarter were actually pretty much in line with what we've seen from a historical average. In fact, it might have been actually slightly better than we've seen in the past. So we're pretty much in line if you look at it across an average over the year.
Kevin K. Gordon
We may benefit from our diversity there. We continue to have -- we're heading toward 10 customers over $100 million in revenues. Again, we're heading in the same directions, and we don't have the large customer over 10%. So I think you may see a little difference that accrues to our diversification there, Don.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bailin with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Jeffrey Bailin - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Tom, maybe just a follow-up on your comments about the increasing diversity and complexity of your backlog. As we think about this, are you suggesting that maybe this could increase the volatility or materially change your backlog conversion rates and similarly, kind of the cost on these trials? Or is that something you are offsetting about how you price for that type of work?
Thomas H. Pike
Interestingly, in some ways, some of these things are less volatile because they are less likely to have a trial-by-trial type of cancellation, and it's one of the things that we're dealing with. But on the other hand, you heard Kevin's numbers before with average trial duration, 50, 53 months. We continue, I think when I look across the competition, to do the most large trials. You just look at the durations that we deal with. We probably do the most large, most complex trials. But when you do add something like a 5-year renewal in obviously, that's adding a little bit to that average duration just by its nature, the benefit, though, is that it's probably got lower volatility over time. So that's why we're starting to just think about much like a company with outsourcing as well as project work. We're just trying to think about how best to portray and forecast this in light of the changing backlog. When you have $10.7 billion, when have a backlog that large, we just may have to think about it little bit different than the rest of the competition does.
I think maybe perhaps with that, we'll tie up the call today, and we really appreciate everybody coming on and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you, operator.
