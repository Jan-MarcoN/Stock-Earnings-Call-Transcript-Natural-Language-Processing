Good morning, and welcome to the Starwood Hotels & Resorts Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Pettibone, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Betina, and thanks to all of you for dialing into Starwood's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Adam Aron, our CEO on an interim basis; and Tom Mangas, our CFO and Executive Vice President.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause results to differ are discussed in Starwood's annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call on our website at www.starwoodhotels.com.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Adam for his comments.
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Stephen. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Starwood's third quarter 2015 call. We're pleased to share a recap of our performance with you these past three months.
Our encouraging third quarter activity and results are yet again another indication that Starwood has been making progress this year on many fronts simultaneously.
As we expected would be the case, our financials for the completed third quarter were favorable, and give us optimism to have a bullish outlook for 2016 on the future of our brands and hotels.
On this call today our CFO, Tom Mangas and I, will be reviewing our financial results for the quarter and we'll add some color on Starwood continuing to push aggressively on these five fronts.
One, enhancing and unleashing value for our shareholders in our timeshare business, as evidenced by our announcement this morning of an agreement for the combination of Interval Leisure Group and Vistana Signature Experiences. Two, accelerating the pace of our growth through more communication with and better performance on behalf of our hotel owners and franchisees. This in turn has been resulting in an advancing trajectory of more new hotel signings for Starwood, more hotel conversions for Starwood, more hotel openings for Starwood, and improved net rooms growth for Starwood. Three, fulfilling our commitment to an asset-light strategy through the sale or other distribution of Starwood-owned hotels.
Four, delivering excellence in our hotel and corporate operations, all the while keeping our costs in check. And five, strengthening our world class brands including punching up the marketing of our existing brands and details today on yet another new brand being unveiled by Starwood in a few weeks, a marketing partnership that consumers will see as our 11th brand. This just seven months after we launched Tribute Portfolio in April.
Before we turn into the quarter, let me comment on a topic in which you are most assuredly interested, our strategic and financial alternatives review and our CEO search. This has the company's highest attention. We've been working hard to thoughtfully consider a variety of alternatives throughout the summer and autumn for Starwood and for each of our timeshare and hotel businesses. Our clear goal is to optimize the value we deliver for our shareholders.
Although there's no specific news to announce on this call today beyond the Vistana/Interval transaction, our progress and our process is active and nearing conclusion. Indeed, I'd be surprised if we don't have answers to these questions before the end of this calendar year. As you can appreciate, we just cannot comment beyond that today. But as soon as we're in a position to announce news, of course we'll do so.
Now let's look at our Q3 results, and you can see the specific fruits of our efforts. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR for our same-store hotels was up 5.4% in constant dollars in the quarter. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $294 million and EPS before special items of $0.74. This was achieved despite unfavorable shifts in foreign exchange and was bolstered by our decisions made earlier in the year to both beef up our sales and marketing activity to drive revenue, while simultaneously cutting above property costs.
Let's now turn to the five topics I referenced earlier that were noteworthy both in the quarter and for the year-to-date. First, a few words on the announcement this morning about the agreement for the combination of Interval Leisure Group and Vistana Signature Experiences. The resulting company in which Starwood's shareholders will have a significant stake, should be a strong one. Compared to the previously announced spinoff of Starwood's timeshare business, this decision to combine with Interval generates substantially better value for our shareholders. We estimate our consideration in this transaction at more than $1.5 billion. And importantly, the combined transaction will create a larger multi-brand company that will be a formidable competitor in the timeshare business.
Second, Starwood is succeeding at accelerating our growth. Our renewed and energized attention to our brands, our hotels, our people, and especially in our hotel owners and franchisees is paying off. From January through September, we opened 68 new hotels. With October almost behind us, we're now at 78 hotels open for the year with over 14,000 new rooms added to our system. That is 47% ahead of last year's newly added rooms for the same time period. Year-to-date, through the end of the third quarter, September 30, we have also signed 141 new hotel deals representing 29,000 rooms. That's a 26% increase in hotel signings and a 33% increase in hotel rooms signed up, compared to the signings during the same time period in 2014.
We're particularly pleased that 12 of the hotels signed this year are already operating in our system and generating fees right now. That's possible because conversions come into our system faster than new builds. In total through the end of Q3 2015, we have signed 31 conversions from other hotel brands, a number that is up 72% from the number of conversions made in the same period last year. And we expect even more conversions to enter the Starwood system before year-end.
Brand after brand is growing. Year-to-date, again through quarter end September 30, Sheraton and Westin combined opened 17 new hotels and signed 30 more. St. Regis opened this year in Istanbul and Mumbai and is slated to open in Dubai and Macau by year-end.
Plus we've signed St. Regis hotels in Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangdong (8:28), all in China, the Maldives and Belgrade.
W remains a powerhouse in the category it created, just opening a few days ago in Amsterdam and scoring a new pipeline of hotels across five continents.
Le MÃ©ridien is having its largest run of openings since we bought the brand in 2005 with 11 Le MÃ©ridien's having opened in the past 12 months.
Luxury Collection will become the largest luxury hotel brand in the world by year-end. We are now over 100 Luxury Collection hotels.
Our select-serve brands, Four Points, Aloft, Element continue to grow our presence in the upscale segment, representing fully 52% of the new hotels in Starwood's pipeline.
Aloft is a particular standout here with 2015 signings continuing to just about double the number of signings same time last year. And RevPAR index for the Aloft brand is up 350 basis points year-to-date.
As for our 10th brand, Tribute Portfolio just celebrated its six-month anniversary. Tribute has had the fastest takeoff ever for a Starwood brand and has gone global. From the initial Royal Palm Hotel in Miami South Beach now adding the Great Northern in London and the Kiroro Hotel of the Kiroro Ski Resort in Japan all opening in 2015.
We are likely to have more than 2500 Tribute rooms open by year-end. In total, we've signed up eight Tribute Portfolio hotels so far and expect to have a dozen signed by Thanksgiving. We are also in sufficiently advanced discussions with owners that we should more than double that number by mid-2016.
Third topic: as you already know we made progress in 2015 on our asset-light strategy. During the quarter we sold the Westin Excelsior Rome for $251 million bringing the total hotel sales achieved in 2015 to $817 million.
We exceeded our goal of $800 million in gross sale proceeds for the full-year and this milestone was achieved three-and-a-half months early.
Other owned and leased hotels are actively in market and buyers are still keen. Based on the interest we've seen, we continue to be positive, about reaching the cumulative goal laid out in 2013, $3 billion of gross hotel asset proceeds by the end of 2016.
Fourth, we continue to make forward steps in the running of the business day-to-day. We've implemented initiatives to improve customer service delivery at our hotels, to enhance communications amongst our own associates to speed up decision-making and to reduce our cost structure.
Indeed you've already seen the cost savings evidenced in our reported SG&A numbers throughout the year.
And fifth, finally, let's move to the heart and soul of this company. Starwood's world-class brands.
Our third quarter again featured progress for Starwood brands thanks to improved marketing and sales activity. Let's start with Sheraton and Sheraton 2020. Our comprehensive plan announced June 1 to put Sheraton back in the spotlight as a brand of choice for travelers worldwide. Sheraton represents more than 40% of Starwood's entire room inventory and polishing the Sheraton brand has been a top companywide priority over the past eight months. Since the June 1 Sheraton 2020 plan unveiling, Sheraton activity has been extensive, breaking the new global Sheraton advertising campaign and for the first time in nearly a decade, Sheraton returning to television with commercials running globally that highlight the brand's more sophisticated positioning.
Unveiling a wholly new sheraton.com website with reservation displays that sell harder. Rolling out a handsome new navy blue, silver and white visual identity for the Sheraton brand. Introducing product upgrades throughout the system to make the enhancement of Sheraton for consumers real and tangible. Launching our new Sheraton Grand tier, highlighting Sheraton's best-in-class hotels worldwide, driving revenue through the richest-ever promotion for Sheraton within SBG, our frequent guest program, and importantly, we communicated this new focus on Sheraton to our Sheraton hotel owners and franchisees.
With these impactful new touch points, Sheraton has not looked this good in a long, long time. More importantly, consumers and hotel owners are noticing, generating portfolio growth and increasing RevPAR index performance. We're pleased to report that since the Sheraton 2020 announcement on June 1 our development team has engaged with Sheraton hotel owners signing nearly 2400 new Sheraton rooms through the end of the third quarter, up more than 61% for Sheraton signings from the same period last year. Sheraton's market share with consumers is also increasing showing that the Sheraton 2020 plan is producing results right out of the chute. Smith Travel Research confirms that the third quarter Sheraton RevPAR index was up year-over-year and increasing 130 basis points over the trend in quarters 1 and 2, January to June.
Moving away from Sheraton, there's also meaningful progress across the entire rest of our brand portfolio. We saw RevPAR index gains, meaning improving market share, in every single one of Starwood's other brands year-to-date. It's not easy to pitch a perfect game, but from a market share perspective, Starwood did just that. And we expect to finalize actions in November that consumers will see an 11th Starwood brand through a marketing partnership with Design Hotels. This will fill a special niche in Starwood's portfolio, incorporating a handpicked collection of independently owned smaller properties committed to individuality, progressive design, and cultural authenticity. There are some truly wonderful Design Hotels today, spread near and far like the Gramercy Park Hotel in Manhattan, the ION Luxury Adventure Hotel in Iceland, the C-Hotel in Lake Como, Italy.
We became a majority but passive investor in Design Hotels back in 2011, Design being a marketing affiliation for a collection of hundreds of smaller hotels averaging about 80 rooms each. But even with the investment in 2011, we left Design Hotels to remain at arm's length from Starwood. Now we are transforming the relationship. Individual Design Hotels will have the opportunity to become full blown marketing partners within the much larger Starwood system, participating in our reservations displays, and SPG, our frequent guest program. Naturally, as you would expect, Starwood's fee stream will rise markedly in exchange for these hotels getting to reap these considerably increased Starwood distribution and loyalty benefits.
In conclusion, we're happy to report to you today that yet again Starwood delivered an encouraging quarter and that progress has continued throughout 2015. Now over to Tom.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Adam. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us. Today I'll begin my prepared remarks with our third quarter 2015 results followed by guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Then I'll turn to our preliminary thoughts on 2016. I'll finish with a few thoughts on our announcement this morning on the spinoff and merger of the Vistana Signature Experiences and Interval Leisure Group, a transaction that we believe will create significant shareholder value.
Starting first with our results, third quarter adjusted EBITDA was 900 â pardon me, $294 million at the high end of our guidance range of $285 million to $295 million. Worldwide system-wide RevPAR on a constant dollar basis, increased 5.4% in the third quarter, above the midpoint of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Our worldwide occupancy in the third quarter increased 200 basis points, reaching a record 73.6%. Aloft continues to outperform, up 10% in constant dollar RevPAR and St. Regis and the Luxury Collection posted strong RevPAR, up 8%.
Around the world guest satisfaction remains high and our hotels grew market share within each of our divisions and in five of our six regions, with only Greater China being essentially flat. Our core management and franchise fees were up 1.9% in actual dollars, in line with our expectations despite shifts in foreign exchange since we issued our guidance range that had a 90 basis points drag on growth. Including foreign exchange, core fees â excluding foreign exchange core fees were up 8%, our strongest showing since the second quarter of 2014. Management fees, franchise fees and other income grew 3.1% in actual dollars.
In our owned and leased portfolio, we saw worldwide constant dollar RevPAR growth of 5.5% at the higher end of our guidance range supported by outstanding performance in Europe where our owned RevPAR was up 13%. As Adam noted, with the sale of the Westin Excelsior, Rome for $251 million in mid-September, we have now reached $817 million of gross proceeds from asset sales above our full-year 2015 goal of $800 million. Our real estate team continues to work to reach our asset-light goal and we remain focused on selling the remaining $1.2 billion in hotel assets by the year-end 2016.
In the meantime we are enjoying the benefit of strong performance in our owned and leased business. On return of cash, we repurchased 1.3 million shares in the third quarter for a total cost of $100 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.375 per share or approximately $64 million in total. Year-to-date, we have returned $328 million through repurchases and $192 million through dividends for a total of $520 million. We're on track to deliver our stated goal to return $600 million to shareholders this year.
Returning to the third quarter, we reported vacation ownership and residential earnings of $46 million, ahead of our expectations, thanks to 10% growth in originated contract sales. That performance speaks to the dedication and strength of our vacation ownership team. They delivered strong results while in the middle of an extremely complex process of preparing for a potential spinoff, while simultaneously working to get across the finish line with the transaction we announced this morning.
On the cost side, our SG&A was up 6.3%. This is higher than we had expected primarily due to an $11 million reserve we booked in the quarter. This reserve was for the potential funding of a performance guarantee at two seasonal properties in Greece due to the impact of economic conditions in that country over the summer. We've continued to focus on cost controls and despite this one-time charge, we are maintaining our full-year SG&A guidance of a 2% to 4% reduction versus prior year.
I will now turn to our performance across our divisions and how that factors into our outlook for the fourth quarter. Beginning in North America. System-wide constant dollar RevPAR grew 5.3% with rate up 3.6% in constant dollars, and occupancy up 120 basis points to an all-time record of 79%. In the U.S., RevPAR was up 5.1% overall and we saw double-digit RevPAR increases in a number of markets including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Orlando.
As we expected, group performance in the third quarter was weaker than this quarter a year ago due to shift of Yom Kippur into September as well as the impact of Labor Day falling a week later. Partially as a result of those calendar shifts, we lacked compression at some of our group-heavy big box hotels particularly in the East, which resulted in lower RevPAR growth versus third quarter last year. In New York which continues to face an oversupply situation and pressure from lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar, our RevPAR was up 1.6%.
Despite the impact of the calendar shifts to group demand, our overall RevPAR performance in North America remained strong, thanks to the great job our teams did in focusing on leisure travel in general, and on holiday periods in particular. While group revenue at our owned and managed hotel in the quarter was roughly flat with last year, retail transient revenue was up nearly 9% in the quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, group pace is up in the high single-digits and we expect U.S. RevPAR growth to continue in the 5% to 6% range. For 2016, group pace is in the low single-digits, a similar level to where we were pacing at this time a year ago. At the end of the third quarter, nearly 60% of our forecasted group business for 2016 is on the books.
In Latin America, third quarter RevPAR was down 5.6% in constant dollars, pulled lower by a 41% decline in RevPAR at our hotels in Brazil that have tough comparables due to last year's World Cup as well as a weak economic condition in that country. Excluding Brazil, Latin America RevPAR was up nearly 3%. In Mexico, RevPAR was up 5.4%. Lower than expected growth at our urban hotels was offset by continued strong performance at resort properties, where RevPAR was up double-digits. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR in Latin America to be below the low end of our worldwide guidance range for the quarter.
Turning to Europe, our hotels performed exceptionally well with constant dollar RevPAR up 10% driven by both ADR and occupancy, which were up 6% and 290 basis points respectively. Our hotels benefited from key regional events in Venice, Milan and London, and favorable travel patterns with Americans taking advantage of Europe on sale as well as the shift of Ramadan that allowed for more leisure travel from the Middle East into Europe during the quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect growth to be in line with our guidance range as we move out of the summer travel season and lap several large events in the fourth quarter last year.
At our hotels in the Middle East and Africa, we saw constant dollar RevPAR up a respectable 5.9% in the third quarter helped by the timing of Ramadan and the Hajj, as well as an easier year-over-year comparison in Africa. However United Arab Emirates RevPAR grew 3% under pressure from weaker demand due to U.S. pegged exchange rates and the continued impact of new supply in Dubai. Going forward into the last quarter of the year, we believe growth in the region will flatten out as commodity pressures continue and the calendar is clean.
Our hotels in Greater China saw a 2.6% drop in constant dollar RevPAR. Macau was down in the high teens. Much of the decline was due to the continued impact of austerity and anti-corruption measures leading to weaker group business. Hong Kong's RevPAR was down over 10% driven partly by their strong currency. Focusing specifically on Mainland China, RevPAR at our hotels grew 1.7% driven by higher occupancy which grew 250 basis points. Performance at our hotels in Shanghai and Beijing was strong with both RevPAR at our hotels up in the mid to high single-digits. However, in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, we did see a falloff in performance in the quarter driven by oversupply and a weaker economic environment. We expect Greater China RevPAR to turn in another quarter of negative RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter.
In contrast to Greater China, constant dollar RevPAR in the rest of Asia Pacific was up 10.7%. Our hotels in Japan, Thailand and Malaysia saw RevPAR increases in double-digits. Our hotels in India performed very well with RevPAR growth over 9%. We expect the rest of Asia RevPAR to continue to perform above our worldwide guidance range in the fourth quarter.
Based on these trends, our outlook for worldwide system-wide constant dollar RevPAR for the fourth quarter anticipates an increase of 3% to 5% mostly driven by the weaker China outlook and the tough prior year comparison in Europe. Based on current rates, foreign exchange will have an approximately 400 basis points drag on RevPAR in the fourth quarter, resulting in reported RevPAR in U.S. dollars of minus 1% to up 1%.
We expect core fee growth in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat versus last year. RevPAR at owned and leased hotels will increase 4% to 6% in constant dollars. Foreign exchange will likely have a 525 basis point drag on owned and leased hotels RevPAR. We expect earnings from our vacation ownership business to be $25 million to $30 million. It is important to note that originated sales are forecasted to be up in the fourth quarter. However, as we start selling units at the Westin Nanea, which is still under construction, we'll be deferring revenues under percentage of completion accounting.
Our total adjusted fourth quarter EBITDA forecast is $300 million to $315 million, and earnings per share before special items is expected to be between $0.76 to $0.82. As a result of these building blocks, we expect full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA to be $1.180 billion to $1.195 billion and EPS before special items to be $2.96 to $3.02. Versus 2014, our owned and leased earnings are absorbing approximately $60 million from asset disposals, which after adding back fees from those hotels following their sales reduces adjusted EBITDA by approximately $37 million. Adjusted EBITDA is also absorbing $46 million in foreign exchange headwinds and roughly $30 million in lower termination fees than we received in 2014, which we think is a good thing.
We expect our cash flow from operations net of vacation ownership inventory spend to be up $800 million to $900 million in 2015. We are reducing our full year guidance to $175 million for maintenance CapEx and $175 million for in-flight projects in development.
Looking ahead to 2016, our initial outlook is for worldwide constant dollar RevPAR increases of 4% to 6%. The asset sales we've completed year-to-date contributed approximately $38 million to 2015 owned and leased earnings that will not be there in 2016. Last, in 2016 we expect net rooms growth to be between 4% to 5% as we guided last month, up from the 2.8% we have done in the trailing 12 months.
Before handing the call back to Stephen, I'd like to take a few brief moments to talk about the Vistana Signature Experiences, Interval Leisure Group transaction we announced earlier this morning. As you know, in February we announced our intention to spin off our vacation ownership business. As we worked to ready ourselves for that transaction, we also continued to look for opportunities to further enhance shareholder value beyond what we could achieve in a straightforward spinoff.
The combination of Vistana and Interval is a great outcome of that process and one that we believe represents a win-win situation for both Starwood and Interval shareholders. As part of this deal, we'll be contributing the same five hotels as contemplated in our Form-10 disclosures, representing roughly $200 million of incremental asset disposals at closing. By being part of a larger dedicated timeshare company with a more diverse and recurring revenue mix and enhanced by meaningful cost avoidance and operating synergies, the combination of Vistana and Interval is positioned to create greater shareholder value than Vistana could as a standalone company. With strong cash flow and a solid pro forma balance sheet, the combined company will be able to reinvest into new properties to compete more effectively than Vistana would have been able to do alone. As we mentioned this morning, we expect the transaction to close early second quarter 2016.
If you've not done so already, I encourage you to listen to the replay of the joint conference call we did with Interval's management this morning to hear the details behind this very exciting combination.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen for Q&A.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Tom. We'd now like to open up the call to your questions. In the interest of time and fairness, please limit yourselves to one question at a time and then we'll take any follow-up questions you might have as time permits.
Betina, can we have the first question, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Yes. Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. As hard as it is to avoid strategic alternatives, I will try and do that. So I guess for Adam and Tom, just curious on your views. Somebody else this morning reporting in the sector talked a little bit about softness in October. It sounds like your outlook of 5% to 6% for 4Q is probably relatively similar to where you were before. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the U.S. business in particular for the fourth quarter? And if you could talk at all a little bit about urban, because you tend to be a little bit more exposed to some of the urban geographies, that would be great. Thanks.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, Shaun. Yeah, this is Tom, and thank you for the question and the avoidance of the elephant in the room. So we're having a good start to the month of October in the U.S. Tracking very much in line with the guidance range we provided for as I said, 5% to 6% on the quarter. So we're seeing that come through month to date. And it's pretty consistent with what we've enjoyed in the month of September.
As I look through the third quarter, we had a strong July, a softer August and a good September and that continues into October. And so we really haven't seen a material change in that trajectory at this point. Relative to the geographic composition, I don't have a city view for you in the month of October. But relative to pockets of strength that we've been enjoying in the overall third quarter, Phoenix, Atlanta, Los Angeles, as I said, have all been good sources of strength. And even New York, which had been often a down market for us, was up 1.6%. So bucking a bit of the trend and we felt like we built a little bit of share there in the quarter as well. So we remain optimistic that the cycle remains intact and our 4% to 6% guidance next year, certainly, is relying on a heavy contribution from North America.
Stephen Pettibone - Vice President-Investor Relations
Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.
Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. I, too, will try to avoid the elephant in the room. I was just hoping you guys maybe will talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the asset sale market. Obviously you sold a big hotel in the quarter; there's reports that you sold two more in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering, A, how the appetite is for the assets; B, what type of long-term management contracts you're able to generate out of those sales; and then, C, if you can maybe give us some color surrounding a lot of your hotels that have ground leases. If you've tried to tap the market for those hotels, if there is a bidder out there for those types of properties, or if you think those are long-term holds?
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks for the question. Clearly, this has been a very successful year in hotel asset sales. When we did our conference call on April 29, we were not in a position to report to you a single closed sale. And now at the end of the third quarter call, we have $817 million banked. You are correct. As I mentioned in my remarks that we have a significant number of other owned hotel assets that are actively being marketed throughout the world. We've seen the same press reports out of the South Pacific that you saw. We're not in a position to either confirm or deny that report. It was not officially released or sanctioned by Starwood. But it is just another indication that the buyer interest in Starwood properties is in fact, keen. I still think we would characterize hotel buyer interest as robust, especially at some of the high quality assets in our stable. You have a list of those 30-plus remaining owned hotels out of the 1,200-plus in our system.
There are some real gems in there. We think they're going to bring real value. In all cases, we continue to look for management contracts or franchise relationships that have 20-year, 30-year, even 50-year terms. So even when we sell a hotel asset, we're keeping it very much in the Starwood system and a generator of fees year-to-date. There are some hotels that involve ground leases and we have been exploring those hotels being included in the hotels that we're taking to market. While they're more complicated than a straight wholly-owned hotel, there appears to be buyer interest there as well. So we've got a goal of roughly $1.2 billion between now and the end of 2016 to hit the $3 billion goal that was announced in 2013. And as we sit here today, we're feeling good about what we've done heretofore and what's coming.

Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Kent with Goldman Sachs.
Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Sorry about that. My biggest question is why â you say you're off to a pretty good start in October, but you do have this deceleration in RevPAR in the fourth quarter. I guess I don't really understand that, or maybe you need to review that again. Especially because you're at such high occupancies, I would think you would be able to push rates higher. And it doesn't seem to be happening.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, so I would say the fourth quarter â Steven, this is Tom by the way. Is much more driven by outside of the U.S. market forces than inside the U.S. As I said, we're still anticipating a 5% to 6% growth. So very consistent U.S. growth. But China, we're expecting almost a 4% RevPAR decline in constant dollars in China in the fourth quarter, largely driven in the Tier 3 and Tier 2 cities there. So that's a big piece. We almost have 150 hotels there. They've been positive contributors to our growth and now become a drag. The other thing I'd say is Europe has been on fire for us. Particularly over the summer holiday seasons with Europe on sale as we move into the fourth quarter. The leisure travel dies down quite substantially and moves back to a much more normalized pace. And so that â you put those two big regions of ours together, unlike some of our more domestically-centric competitors, it drags down the overall worldwide RevPAR guidance range.

Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys; good afternoon. Thanks. Could you guys talk a little bit â and obviously from the results, we see Europe's picked up pretty nicely. Could you guys maybe try and hone in a little bit on some of the markets where you're seeing strength and what your expectation is for next year? And provide any kind of color, if we were to start now with current FX rates, what you would see as being the headwind next year on a RevPAR adjusted basis?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, so let me take the last one first. I don't think I'm quite prepared to give you a RevPAR constant dollar versus actual dollar. I think by giving you the 4% to 6%, trying to lay out what we think it is and currencies continue to move. As we said, it was a 90 basis point drag in the current quarter for us. So I wouldn't want to snap the chalk line quite today. Certainly when we come out in February we'll tell you what that drag is.
Look, I think the growth markets for us outside of North America have been in Europe and some of the major destination cities in Europe. Spain and Italy were up all in the mid-teens for us in the third quarter. Austria, Turkey, as well. These high travel leisure destinations have certainly benefited from the weaker currency. I think as that starts to lap next year we may see some of that get back. I do expect that Europe moderates back into our guidance range in 2016 versus leading it in the current year.
We continue to think that the rest of Asia, which has been strong with Thailand coming off the coup, which was up 41% in the third quarter, continues to strengthen and be a strong market as well as India. And at some point, we will â Brazil will have a return to normalcy and they've got some strong activity next year. It will not be as much of a drag in 2016 as it has been in the current year.

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, if I could fit in one quick numbers question and then a broader question. Just on the numbers, you lowered your core fee growth from 2% to 4%, to 0% to 1% for 2015. Can we get the bridge? I think FX was an impact, but just want to understand what else? And then I asked this same question earlier today, but if you were to adjust for your geographic mix in the U.S., how would you think about supply growth versus what STR is forecasting? Thanks.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Can you repeat there, Thomas, the mix question on geographic mix? I'm not sure I caught the core of the question.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes, so STR is forecasting 1.2% supply growth this year; I think 1.4%, 1.5% supply growth next year. Obviously, in gateway markets we're seeing higher growth in markets like New York and expect to see a big pickup in Boston next year. So if you were to adjust for your geographic mix, do you think it would be above the national average, meaningfully above the national average, or in line with what STR is forecasting?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
All right. Most helpful, Thomas. I'll take the fee growth reconciliation and Adam will take the geographic mix question. Yeah, so your point's right on the core fee growth. There are two building blocks, right? Building block number one is the FX impact. It is a significant one. As I said, it had about $5 million impact in the quarter. Certainly that FX impact carries through into the fourth quarter so that's a significant piece and for the full quarter of that.
But also, as I said, our RevPAR range is lower in the fourth quarter driven by a much weaker China. And a modestly weaker Europe than we expected. So we didn't â we certainly weren't expecting for RevPAR declines in Greater China when we guided the last time, and certainly we're trying to square-up our forecast with that reality.
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
On supply, I think this is one of the good news stories for Starwood. And our supply posture, the supply posture that we face is much different than that of our major competitors. Number one, because they're more focused in the United States than is Starwood. And number two, they have a much bigger concentration in the upscale and upper mid-scale and even mid-scale segments. That's where most of the supply growth is coming in North America over the next several years. If you actually look at supply growth in the luxury and upper upscale segments where Starwood is a much stronger player, where we have most of our exposure, supply growth is very modest. So I think from a supply growth perspective, Starwood looks in relatively good shape.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello, everyone. Just I guess the one question I want to ask that hasn't been asked or can't be asked and wouldn't be answered. Just with regard to your 2016 net room guidance of 4% to 5%, what geographies or what brands or segments is driving that range?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, what I'll say Joe. Thank you, this is Tom Mangas. We've certainly had the benefit of a strong signing pipeline in the last several years and our challenge has been to convert those into openings and to minimize our exits. And if you look at the composition of our pipeline, I mean, it is strongly driven by the upscale segment brands that we have with Aloft, Four Points and Element being significant drivers of that. I think Adam mentioned, it was almost 50% of our recent signings. So they will lead the growth of that net rooms growth.
But for sure, we're getting strong contribution across all our brands. Tribute has been a significant contributor in the current year. I think it will continue to be a significant contributor in 2016 as more of the deals we've been working come to fruition and open. Luxury Collection has been on fire and driving a significant number of conversions in the year. I believe that continues. Right now, we talked about the Design Hotels brand that our consumers will see. Right now we're not assuming any contribution from Design Hotels in that 4% to 5%, so it's really from the brands that we've introduced and know.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC
How much of that is being driven by lower churn? And are you seeing the same amount of or estimating the same amount of gross room additions?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
You're naughty, Joe, for jumping back in with another question. It is continued strength in the gross adds. We are working hard to mitigate our exits and make sure that when we exit a hotel it's one we want to exit. But we are not assuming a materially different trajectory in exits in order to achieve our 4% to 5% target next year.

Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon, thanks. Tom, just wondering what kind of fee growth is implied by the 4% to 6% RevPAR growth forecast for 2016. And then just point of clarification on the group business for next year: you talked about pace. Just wondering what kind of price increases you're seeing. And then I just missed how much you're booked for next year.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
All right. Take my notes here. So we've not guided yet, Felicia, on what's the fee growth translation of that 4% to 6% because that is a constant dollar RevPAR forecast. Certainly we're going to have adds from the portfolio coming into the system. So I want to hedge and beg off until February to give you a more complete outlook on our building blocks of EBITDA.
On the percent booked, we've got about 6% of our group business booked for 2016. And relative to the pricing, I would say that â give me one second here to find my notes on that. Yeah, I would say that most of our growth in the group activity next year is from price. We're probably tracking in the low to mid-single-digits of rate on the group business in 2016 in our pace statistics. And so really it's rate that's driving all our growth that's on the books today in that low single-digit guidance point we gave you.

Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Hi. So as busy as you all have been at Starwood and the value you've added in the last six months, can you give us an update on how active the CEO search is? And if there's no real answer there, I'm begging for a mulligan, which is, if you could give us the mix of your corporate and leisure business and to what extent Airbnb has impacted each piece of that. Thanks.
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
So I'm going give you your mulligan, and it's the CEO who's talking. It's all in the same comment as before. Both processes have been robust, active, highest attention, and we're nearing conclusion. And as soon as we have news to announce, we'll share it with you. Given that you gave us the out to duck it, we're definitely going to make sure we answer the other question. Tom, you want to take that one?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I would say that our corporate business remains to be quite strong. As we mentioned, our retail business was up in the high single-digits. Our corporate volumes tend to be also in the mid-single-digits, up. Our overall transient total growth in the third quarter was about 5.5% on the quarter. So we were feeling confident and our great negotiations continue to progress well. And I do think â I saw your piece, Harry, on the corporate trends relative to Airbnb, which was part of the question. I don't know if, Adam, you want to speak to a bit about Airbnb. But we agree with the thesis that you laid out. As we've talked to our corporate clients, we don't see Airbnb as a particular threat to that business today. Maybe their business model evolves. But we are, given the kind of services that we're providing at our hotels and what we believe our corporate clients want, we believe that's a low-risk threat to our business.
And so I think as long as corporate profits continue to grow, our corporate business will perform well. I will tell you in the segments, though, we are seeing relative weakness in the energy segment. As I look across our corporate clients, energy is down about 20% versus â on a third quarter basis versus prior year. So other segments are up and compensating for it. That one is being hard-hit.
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
Tom invited me in on Airbnb. So let me just say this. Airbnb is real. It's here to stay. The hotel industry as an industry has some issues with Airbnb on things like collecting accommodations tax and other issues. But I think we all have to (49:26) that the shared economy is part of the way the world will work in the 21st century. Airbnb has been growing gangbusters in 2015. It hasn't stopped Starwood from reporting three strong quarters in a row. I do believe that the world's hospitality industry is large enough that it can accommodate Airbnb as a major player, as there are dozens of major players in the world's hotel industry today. And we, not only Starwood, but anyone in the industry will be able to be a strong competitor even with Airbnb alongside.

Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. I just wanted to circle back on your strategy around the Sheraton network. You mentioned 2,400 new rooms coming in. Are these mostly conversions or are they newbuilds? As you think about continuing to split the system along Grand and Sheraton, would there be any repositioning of Sheraton into a different chain scale? Or would you expect it to still compete in the upper upscale, as defined by Smith Travel?
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
All right. So let's do conversions versus newbuilds. The answer is both. And we're grabbing conversions and we're grabbing newbuilds. And as I said on the call in my earlier remarks, Sheraton's signing pace is way up year-over-year. Faster than anyone would have any right to expect. And that, I think when we unveiled Sheraton 2020, what we heard over and over again from the hotel owner community was, it's about time. This is a hotel brand that does $9 billion of revenue annually across its system. And it hasn't had the benefit of some of those specific items that I talked about in my remarks, whether it's advertising, or new brand identity, or a better website, or rich SPG promotions, on and on. And the fact that we're paying much greater attention to Sheraton, making it a much larger Starwood company-wide priority. We're getting results. You see it in the market share numbers that have already responded right away.
In terms of Sheraton Grand, we did some extensive market research on how Sheraton Grand would affect the whole of the Sheraton system. And two things became very clear in that research. One is that Sheraton Grand allowing us to really put a highlight on the best-in-class Sheraton hotels worldwide, would do gangbusters for those Sheraton Grand hotels. People would expect better service delivery, would expect to pay higher pricing to stay at one of those hotels. And it allows the Sheraton Grands not to be dragged down by more normal hotels throughout the core Sheraton brand.
But the second thing that was just as compelling was, we have, just as British Airways had a Concorde in ages past and big 747s going everywhere and most of the people on those 747s never saw the inside of the Concorde, having a premium product within a brand allows you to create a halo effect for the entirety of the brand.
So when consumers were asked, if a meaningful number of Sheraton were renamed Sheraton Grand, how would that change your perception of the entire Sheraton portfolio overall? Not just the Sheraton Grands but the non-Sheraton Grands? 75% of consumers said their impressions of a regular Sheraton, a core Sheraton, would be improved because alongside it within the same brand is a Sheraton Grand. We do not anticipate the Sheratons trading down to a lower chain scale. We do believe that Sheratons will stay upper upscale hotel. And candidly, we think Sheraton Grands will stay upper upscale hotels. We don't see them creeping up as a luxury player, but both the Sheraton Grand properties and the non-Sheraton Grand properties, we believe, will be stronger upper upscale properties as a result of the effort.

Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC
Great; thanks. My question is, looking at your 2016 RevPAR guidance, I guess what strikes me is the range you are giving, shows an acceleration from the range of guidance for 2015; and you've just lowered your 2015 outlook a little. And I guess just given the macro risks out there and other companies lowering 2015 guidance and calling out different factors, what's the basis for seeing accelerated growth in 2016 when you're lowering the 2015 outlook?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, it is â they're one and the same issue. The fact that we've seen deceleration in China and we get to anniversary of that next year, that is a big driver. So if I just give you a few statistics on that, Robin.
So China for us on a system-wide basis last year, the first quarter did 0.4% RevPAR growth in constant dollars, then it went 0.3% negative, 2.6% negative, 4.2% negative. Our view is China doesn't go negative forever. It starts to anniversary some of these periods. And that starts to buildup actual positive RevPAR in the year ahead. So that is one of the biggest drivers of why we're confident that despite the fourth quarter being down, to be lower relative to the balance of the year, it's driven by China and that China bounces back in the back, in 2016.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC
And China, so it's China that makes the overall, that's enough to make company-wide RevPAR accelerate?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, the short answer is, the guidance for the U.S. is holding constant. All right. So if I take a significant building block that's been negative and turn it to positive.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC
Oh, okay.
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Turn it positive. I'm not â my full year RevPAR guidance with three quarters in the books is 4% to 5%. Right? So 4% to 5% is not different than 4% to 6%. I just raised the top end by 100 basis points, because I have the potential for China not to be such a drag as it has been in the current year. It may be the easiest way to say it.

Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI
Hey, guys; good afternoon. I appreciate Ian's earlier question; I think it's the British accent that makes us take him all more seriously here. But looking for a bit of commentary on New York, if you don't mind. It does seem like the market has incrementally gotten better over the last two or three quarters. Wondering if you can help us handicap what next year might look like in the context of your overall guidance. Even if you can't throw out numbers, just are you expecting a general trend of improvement such as we've seen?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, I would say that we're probably a tad early to give much color on that, Rich. I think some of the factors that have led to a weaker New York market in 2015 still are present in 2016. Strong supply continues to come in. It is getting absorbed. I think the trend on New York in general has been favorable that we're clipping from negative to positive here. And so I think that can be a positive building block. But I think with several projects that are just complete or nearing completion, I think that the supply situation will persist. I don't think New York becomes a strong market for us. The question to me that will parse out through our budget reviews, which happen in the course of this month is, is it no longer a drag and becomes a positive building block and that remains to be seen.

Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
I wanted to circle back on FX. Looks like the headwind to RevPAR growth has increased from 300 bps heading into the year to 450 bps most recently. If current exchange rates hold, what type of headwind does that translate to on next year's guided 4% to 6% constant dollar growth?
Thomas B. Mangas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, I haven't done that math yet, Vince. It's going be a significant impact because we're still â we'll be lapping for half a year the Chinese currency and the kind of the summer swoon that we had. We're starting to pull ourselves out of the Euro decline that happened. The second quarter was our worst quarter of impact from FX. If I think about the differential between our third quarter reported on fee growth â moving it away from RevPAR because I have it on fees, but more â we have about a 600 basis point spread in the third quarter on year-over-year FX impact. That moderates in the fourth quarter to about a 400 basis point impact. And so each quarter it's going to step down a bit. So I'd just be speculating what the absolute impact is because I haven't done the math yet and I'd like the opportunity to kind of give you better update when we're closer in on FX rates and on our budget.
Adam M. Aron - Interim Chief Executive Officer & Director
