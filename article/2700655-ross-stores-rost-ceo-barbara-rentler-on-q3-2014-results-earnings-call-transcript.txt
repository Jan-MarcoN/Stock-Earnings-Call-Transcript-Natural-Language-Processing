Good afternoon and welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared remarks by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecast and other matters that are based on the Companyâs current forecast of aspects of its future business.
These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in todayâs press release and the companyâs fiscal 2014 Form 10-K and fiscal 2014 Forms 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.
Now, Iâd like to turn the call over to the companyâs Chief Executive Officer, Barbara Rentler.
Barbara Rentler
Good afternoon. Joining me on the call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael OâSullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Wong, Director of Investor Relations. Weâll begin with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the upcoming holiday season. Afterwards, weâll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.
As noted in todayâs press release, we are pleased with our better than expected performance in the third quarter. Our results benefited from our ongoing ability to deliver compelling bargains to our customers, which drove above planned sales gains and strong merchandise gross margin. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2014 were $0.93, up 16%, from $0.80 in the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter were $193 million up from $172 million last year. Sales rose 8% to $2.599 billion with the comparable store sales up 4% over the prior year.
For the first nine months of 2014, earnings per share were $3.22, up 13% from $2.86 for the same year-to-date period in 2013. Net earnings grew to $676 million, up from $619 million for the first nine months of 2013. Sales increased 7% to just over $8 billion, with comparable store sales up 2% over the same period in 2013. Similar to Ross same store sales at ddâs DISCOUNTS increased for the quarter and year-to-date period, as their customers also responded favorably to ddâs value offering.
Juniors and home were the strongest businesses at Ross during the quarter, while the Midwest and Texas were the top-performing regions. Operating margin of 11.8%, was up about 55 basis points over last year, due to a 40 basis point improvement and cost of goods sold and a 15 basis point decline in selling, general and administrative expenses. Michael Hartshorn will provide additional color on these operating margin trend in a few minutes.
As we ended the third quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 5% over last year, while pack-away levels were 42% of total inventories, compared to 45% at this time in 2013. Average in-store inventories were down 2% at the end of the quarter. And we continue to target selling store inventories for the balance of the year to be down 1% to 2%. We also completed our 2014 store expansion program during the third quarter. After closing some older locations at year-end, we expect to end FY2014 with 1,210 Ross and 152 ddâs DISCOUNTS location for a net addition of 86 new stores this year.
With respect to infrastructure investments, we closed on the purchase of our New York buying office property in September as planned, financing the transaction with proceeds from our recent public bond offering of $250 million. During the quarter, we also brought online a new distribution center in Rock Hill, South Carolina. While these investments create some expense headwinds in the short term, we are confident they will enhance our prospects with the continued profitable growth of our enterprise over the longer term.
Now, Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our third quarter results and details on our guidance for the fourth quarter and the year.
Michael J. Hartshorn
Thank you, Barbara. Our 4% comparable store sales gain in the third quarter was driven by a combination of slightly higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. As Barbara noted, third quarter operating grew 55 basis points to 11.8%.
Cost of goods sold improved by 40 basis points, benefiting from a 55 basis point increased in merchandise gross margin and a 5 basis point improvement in distribution costs due to the timing of packaway-related costs. This was partially offset by 10 basis point increase each in freight and buying.
Selling, general and administrative expenses improved by about 15 basis points during the period, mainly due to leverage on the 4% same-store sales increase. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $141 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $418 million.
We remain on track in 2014 to repurchase a total of $550 million in common stock, which would complete the two-year $1.1 billion authorization approved at the beginning of 2013.
Letâs now turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. As noted in todayâs press release, for the 13 weeks ending January 31, 2015, we continue to project a 1% to 2% increase in same-store sales and earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.09. This compares to $1.02 for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2014.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, operating statement assumptions include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 6% on the previously mentioned 1% to 2% projected increased in same-store sales. If sales are within this range, we would expect fourth quarter operating margin to decline about 30 basis points to 50 basis points to 12.2% to 12.4% on relatively flat merchandise gross margin with some deleveraging on expenses.
As previously mentioned, buying and distribution costs are forecast to increase as a percent of sales due to the acquisition of our New York buying office and the ramp-up of our new distribution center in South Carolina. In addition, we are planning about $2 million in net interest expense in the fourth quarter, mainly related to our aforementioned bond offering.
Our tax rate is expected to be 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are estimated to be about $207 million. Again, if the fourth quarter sales and margin perform in line with our forecast, and we project that earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending January 31, 2015 would increased 10% to 11% to $4.28 to $4.32.
Now, Iâll turn the call back to Barbara.
Barbara Rentler
Thank you, Michael. To sum up, our ongoing focus on delivering compelling bargains on bargains on name-brand fashions for the family and the home have driven respectable sales and earnings growth in the first nine months of the year. Itâs important to note, we achieved these gains in a very challenging climate for apparel retail, especially given the ongoing difficult and volatile macroeconomic backdrop that continues to especially pressure the low to moderate income customer.
Looking ahead, we are pleased with our assortments as we enter the important fourth quarter. Our merchants have done a terrific job of acquiring a wide array of exciting and sharply priced name-brand fashions and gifts to appeal to todayâs value-driven shoppers. That said we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious outlook as we have all year, given continued uncertainty in the overall environment and the likelihood of an intensely competitive and promotional holiday season.
To address these headwinds, we will stay focused on operating our business with lean selling-store inventories and tight expense control. As always, our most important priority is our unwavering commitment to offering our customers the best bargains possible. We are confident that the investments we are making in infrastructure, people, and processes will further strengthen our ability to deliver the value our customers expect. As we have said a number of times, consistently delivering on this mission will always be the key to maximizing our potential for future sales and earnings growth over both the near and the long-term.
At this point, we would like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson-Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you, good afternoon. Just wanted to ask about your fourth-quarter merchandise margin guidance of flat. Is there an opportunity there, given the decline that you saw in the fourth quarter of last year on the gross margin line and anything to call out as opportunities there?
John G. Call
Yes, Lorraine, this is John. As Barbara mentioned similar to how weâve operated during the year, we are entering the quarter cautiously, optimistic that if things go our way, we can do better. So I wouldnât read anything into the â in terms of how we have it planned flat, we think we do have some upside, if we can operate into what looks to be a very, very competitive fourth quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro of The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.
Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker
Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about, we heard a lot of noise about the weather. And I know itâs not something thatâs usually a big deal for you. But now that youâre in the Midwest and weâre coming up against a very cold third quarter of last year, can you talk a little bit about the Midwest, and how youâre thinking how the third quarter was, and how youâre thinking about this winter versus last winter?
Michael OâSullivan
Yes. I guys Marni, itâs Michael OâSullivan. Let me cover that with two points. First of all, in terms of weather, weather can always be more or less favorable, especially at this time of the year and going into the fourth quarter. Certainly, in the third quarter weather really wasnât a factor. We donât know whatâs ahead of us in the fourth quarter from the weather perspective. In terms of the Midwest more broadly though weâve been very happy with how we performed in the Midwest over the last few quarters.
And I think weâd mentioned almost a year-ago, that we werenât happy with some aspects of the Midwest, particularly the assortments. And we donât those problems werenât caused by the weather; they were caused by internal issues in terms of how we plan those assortments. Weâve corrected those, so weâre hoping to do better. And as we go into the fourth quarter, weâll have to find out whether those things have paid off or not.
Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker
Fantastic, and if you can give us an update, as well, on the accessories part of the business? Any color around it?
Barbara Rentler
The accessories business in the first half of the year really struggled. What we saw in the third quarter is that weâve seen some improvement, itâs still trailing the chain. We feel a little bit better about it in the fourth quarter, and we expect to be back on track by spring of 2015.
Marni Shapiro-The Retail Tracker
Fantastic, best of luck for the holidays.
Barbara Rentler
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Paul Lejuez-Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
Hey, thanks guys. As youâre thinking about store growth for next year, Iâm just wondering how youâre thinking has evolved in terms of the optimal store size. As you continue to grow both in existing and new markets, have you thought any differently about what is the right size for any given store, considering that youâve been able to take a lot of inventory out of the stores over the last couple of years? Thanks.
Gary L. Cribb
Sure, Paul. I will take that. This is Gary. We have looked at our store prototype and we have a very flexible model that allows us to take advantage of real estate opportunities, as well as right-sizing it, in any particular location.

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine of Canaccord. Your line is now open.
Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity Securities
Thanks for taking my question. Iâm just wondering if you can let us know how you assess that the promotional environment will be more competitive this Q4 than it was a year ago? Is it just the pace of the promotions, or how do you look at your competitive set?
Barbara Rentler
We are anticipating that the promotional environment will be much more aggressive, and we look at two things. We look at the pace, the amount of times that our competitors promote, and we also look at the depths that they promote. Since weâre in the value business, off of mainstream retailers, weâre constantly monitoring that.
Laura Champine-Canaccord Genuity Securities
Got it, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin of William Blair & Company. Your line is open.
Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company
Good afternoon, nice results. One question I would have would be I know it is still somewhat early in this, but with gas prices coming down, how big a benefit do you think it was in the tail end of the quarter? And is that something that you think could be a potential source of upside in the fourth quarter if things kind of hold where they are right now, not assuming they continue to go down but?
Michael OâSullivan
Yes, Daniel, I guess conceptually, lower gas prices, in fact, anything that puts more money in the customerâs pocket, is a good thing. But, itâs very difficult for us to isolate a single variable like that, like gas prices. There are so many other factors, some good, like the decline in unemployment rates or the anniversarying of cuts in government programs, but some bad factors, as well, like the increase in part-time work or the lack of wage growth for low-income workers. So, weâre not economists, so itâs for us to sort of calibrate those things and create them off against each other. So we really donât know to what degree gas prices helped or to what degree they will help going forward.
Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company
Okay. And then can you talk about maybe some of the other regional performance? You talked about the best regions, what were, if there were any regions that are below the chain materially, and the same thing on the merchandise side, in terms of the other categories that maybe performed not as well or better than average?
Michael OâSullivan
Sure on the regions, as Barbara said in her remarks, the top-performing regions were the Midwest and Texas. Other than that, there were no other areas of regional performance that are worth calling out. And then on â in terms of businesses, our top performing businesses were Juniors and home.
Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company
Okay, and by the same token, nothing else was materially different on the other direction?
Michael OâSullivan
Thatâs right.
Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company
Okay. And then, would you â I missed a little bit of the part where you discussed the gross margin, the components of the gross margin. Would you mind just repeating those quickly? Thank you.
Michael Balmuth
Sure, Dan. Itâs Michael. So for the quarter, merchandise margin was up 55 basis points, and that was offset by freight in buying, which was about 10 basis points each, and then distribution was slightly better due to the timing of pack-away.
Daniel Hofkin-William Blair & Company
Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jeffries. Your line is open.
Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company
Great, thanks a lot. I guess my question is regarding the infrastructure in process improvements, investments are making. You talked about some of the near-term headwinds. When do those headwinds lift, and what are some of the measurable benefits you expect to see from these investments? Is it things like stronger inventory turns, or what should we expect in terms of the benefit of payout long-term on those investments? Thanks. Appreciate it.
Michael J. Hartshorn
So, Randy, itâs Michael Hartshorn. So the infrastructure investment, as we mentioned, there are really about three things. Itâs opening two new distribution centers and opening â purchasing our New York buying office. In terms of the distribution centers, it gives us the capacity to grow into what we believe to be 2,500 stores. So that is a capacity play. Those investments tend to be a bit lumpy, but after we get through the two new distribution centers, the second of which will open mid-next year, we shouldnât need any capacity for the next couple of years.
Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company
And can I ask a follow-up then on the buying office?
Michael Balmuth
Sure.
Michael J. Hartshorn
Sure.
Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company
Can you hear me?
Michael Balmuth
Yeah [indiscernible]
Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company
Can you hear me? Okay, great. So do you expect to see any measurable change in the number of vendor partners youâre using over the next five years? How should we think about the sourcing side of the business over the next five years and how that may change or not change? Thanks.
Barbara Rentler
Weâre always looking to increase our vendor base, and so thatâs why we continue to invest in the merchant organization. So that they can go out and build relationships to get better access to close outs and to add additional resources. So we expect it to grow.
Randy Konik-Jefferies & Company
Got it thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Kimberley Greenburger of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Kimberley Greenberger-Morgan Stanley
Sorry, I just realized I was on mute. Thank you so much, and Iâll add my congratulations on a really terrific quarter. Michael, just a couple of questions for you. Did you receive any benefit in the third quarter from your physical inventory in margin? Also, you mentioned that traffic was up slightly in the quarter. It sounds like you saw a bigger increase in the average basket. Is that coming from the average unit retail price or units per transaction? And then for Barbara, Iâm wondering if youâre buying team is starting to see any inventory dislocation from the disruption of goods flowing through the port? And if not yet, do you think that might be an opportunity for inventory acquisition in the future? Thanks so much.
Michael J. Hartshorn
Kimberly on shortage, so like last year, our physical inventory results were very similar to our ongoing shortage accrual, so there was no impact of a true up during the quarter when we took the physical inventory. Our results again improved on top of historically low levels, so weâre very happy with the progress weâve made there. In terms of the composition of comp, as we mentioned in the remarks, our comp was up 4%, driven by a slight increase in transactions and a higher basket. The basket increase was entirely driven by higher units per transaction, as AUR was flat to last year.
Barbara Rentler
And as it pertains to inventory from the port, it is hard to tell. It is â itâs a buyersâ market, thereâs a lot of merchandise in the market right now. Itâs hard to differentiate whatâs from the port or not. But what I would say is that whenever there is a disruption like that in the marketplace, it definitely leads to supply. So you would expect that we would see supply sometime the end of this year into beginning of next year.
Kimberley Greenberger-Morgan Stanley
Great thanks, Barbara, and good luck for holiday.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research
Good afternoon, everyone. A question on ddâs. Iâm wondering are the same factors that are driving your performance at Ross also driving ddâs with respect to traffic transaction? And also, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the category performance there? Thank you.
Michael OâSullivan
So Jeff, as you know, we donât disclose ddâs financials separately; itâs just not material to the overall Corporation. But in broad terms, as Barbara mentioned in her remarks, ddâs comp performance was strong in the third quarter, so weâre very happy.
Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research
Any comment, can you comment at all, Michael, on category â just category performance at ddâs?
Michael OâSullivan
No, we typically donât break that out separately for the dd segment.
Jeffrey Stein-Northcoast Research
I see, and then finally, can you just talk a little bit about your trend â your business trend during the third quarter? Was it fairly even throughout the quarter, or did it get better or worse towards the end of the quarter?
Michael OâSullivan
Sure, this is Michael again. Sales ran ahead of plan for us throughout the quarter. The strongest months were August and September when the back-to-school customer was motivated to shop. The trends slowed a bit in October with warmer weather.
Jeffrey S. Stein-Northcoast Research
Great, and Michael, CapEx for next year, do have any thoughts?
Michael OâSullivan
At this point, we wouldnât talk about next year. It will come down though based on the infrastructure investments we made this year.
Jeffrey S. Stein-Northcoast Research
Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Mann from Johnson Rice & Company. Your line is now open.
David Mann-Johnson Rice & Company
All right, thank you, let me add my congratulations on a great quarter. Question about the SG&A line. Iâm just curious with the 4% comp, anything that held you back about leveraging that operating expense number a little bit more, which might have been expected on such a good comp?
Michael OâSullivan
David, itâs Michael again. So I think what weâve said longer-term is that we usually lever around a three comps, so with the four comp and 15 basis point improvement, itâs about in line with that longer-term model it is a bit worse than the second quarter, but as a reminder, we had about a 20-basis-point benefit from a legal matter.
David M. Mann-Johnson Rice & Company
And then in terms of inventories at the store level, whatâs your latest thought process about any ability to take those inventories down further?
Michael OâSullivan
Yes, David, as youâre aware, weâve taken inventory down very aggressively over the last several years, something in the order of 40%. We continue to shave inventories and trim them where we can. At the end of the third quarter, inventories were down 2%. Weâre expecting them to be down another point or two at the end of the fourth quarter, and then weâre putting our plans together for next year.
David Mann-Johnson Rice & Company
Great, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow of Sterne Agee. Your line is now open.
Ike Boruchow-Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Hi everyone, congratulations on a great quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones: I know youâve already talked about this, but the merchandise margin increased 55 basis points, so sequentially better than Q2. Iâm curious, Michael, if you could just dig in what exactly helped drive the sequential improvement in the year-over-year margin gain? And also, it doesnât look like you bought back any stock in Q3. I canât remember the last time you didnât buy back stock in the quarter. Was there a reason for that? Just a timing thing? Just curious there. Thanks.
Michael J. Hartshorn
So first on the stock, we did buyback stock during the quarter, we bought it back the first half of the year by quarter, so. And then on margin gains, the improvement during the quarter was a combination of fast returns and lower inventory, and also our ability to take advantage of the buying opportunities in the marketplace, which customers responded favorably to. So, a little bit of markdowns and a little bit of markup to the margin performance.
Ike Boruchow-Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.

Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.
Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group
Good afternoon, everyone. Can you give an update on the planning and allocation at the more local level and what youâre seeing there? How is that going? And then if you think broadly about improving sales productivity over the next few years at ddâs and at core Ross, where should it come from and how do you think of the size of the box? Thank you.
Michael OâSullivan
Okay, Dana. Itâs Michael OâSullivan. Iâll take the first part of your question about more local planning and allocation. As you know, weâve rolled out a fairly major program, micro merchandising about three years ago. And the idea of that, the intent was that we would be able to plan and trend our business at a more detailed level, a more local level. Now itâs impossible for us to isolate the impact just to micro merchandising, but certainly itâs been a major enabler of our ability to reduce inventories over the last several years by making sure that we have the right product in the right place at the right time.
Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group
Thank you. And then and then sales productivity.
Michael OâSullivan
The second part of your question, Dana?
Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group
On the sales productivity, where do you think â what is an optimal sales per foot for ddâs and for Ross, and what drives it there? Is it new categories? Is it ticket?
Michael OâSullivan
At a high level I think what really drives our sales productivity is having the best values we can in the store. And we, all the time, were looking across different categories, different areas of merchandise even new categories, to see whether we can drive additional productivity. Thatâs the ongoing program.
Dana Telsey-Telsey Advisory Group

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America
Hi. So my question is how do you guys think about whatâs going on with department stores and how that impacts your business? One thing weâve seen this quarter and even last quarter is that department store inventories are in much better shape and their gross margins look better. Does that raise the pricing umbrella for you? Make it easier for you to operate and not have to discount as much? Conversely, I guess one risk might be that thereâs less product available, although I think if youâre getting less from department stores, you are getting more from vendors. How do those dynamics play out? Thanks.
Barbara Rentler
Well I would say thereâs a few things, Mike. One, first of all, in terms of availability there is a lot of product in the marketplace. In terms of department stores versus how they price, we really look at the value. So we look at where they are in pricing versus where we need to be in pricing so that we offer the customer great branded bargains, and so thatâs really how we look at it. The level of inventory that we promote usually increases with the level of inventory traditionally.
Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America
Right. So I guess thatâs the question: their inventories have actually â the year-over-year growth inventory is as low as itâs been in five or six quarters. So, I would suspect that theyâre not promoting as much, and then because of what you just said, and because of that, I would think that you wouldnât have to promote as much. Has that had any impact on your business this quarter, or do you think it might going forward?
Barbara Rentler
So actually, Mike, they have promoted significantly this quarter, both in most department stores, particularly the mid tier. So thereâs been heavy promotions that have gone on this quarter, and weâre expecting that to continue into the fourth quarter. Actually weâre expecting that to get even more promotional. We donât promote. So weâre in an everyday value business, so we have to anticipate where we think they are going to be, and then set our values based off of where we think theyâre going to bench their promotions. But in Q3, they absolutely promoted, and we are anticipating them to be even more aggressive in Q4
Michael Baker-Deutsche Bank North America
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Roxanne Meyer-UBS Securities
Great, thanks and congratulations on a strong quarter. My question is about home. Iâm just wondering how far above the chain did home perform, and can you talk to the areas of home maybe that led in performance, and whether thereâs still opportunity for some niches within home to still ramp up? Thanks a lot.
Barbara Rentler
We were very pleased with our performance in home. It was better-than-expected performance. We feel the merchants really did a fine job of delivering exciting great product at great values. In terms of what areas performed in Q3, I really donât really think itâs appropriate for me to talk through that. What I can tell you is that in Q4, we are very focused on gifts and home. And I would say our home performance was better than the chain, in terms of a measurement.

Your next question comes from the line of Richard Jaffe of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Richard Jaffe-Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Thanks very much guys. And I know youâve talked about the opportunities out in the marketplace, and wonder if you would just comment further on that the port strike seems to â or the slowdown in the Port of Los Angeles, seems to have provided some opportunities, particularly not only for the season, but for pack-away. And Iâm wondering how youâre thinking about those opportunities, and if you might get more aggressive, given what might be the unique nature of some of the opportunities this year?
Barbara Rentler
The way we look at that is pack-away is really, it is opportunity, so we look at each deal on a deal-by-deal basis. So we donât go out and say we want to raise our pack-away levels or contract our pack-away levels. The merchants are really out in the market constantly shopping to see what becomes available, and if the port could become available a little bit sooner than later, some we would flow this quarter, some we would move into 2015. It depends when we get them. But really, there â the science to it, it has to be a terrific branded great value to put it into pack-away so that the customer really feels good about it when it comes out the following season.

So even though youâve operated in a pretty tight parameter of pack-away, sort of 38% to 42% roughly, you wouldnât, given the circumstances, allow that to increase, should circumstances as you describe them prevail?
Barbara Rentler
There is no target number up or down. Pack-away is really the results of whatâs available and how great the bargain is. So if we found pack-away that was terrific that we could â and a number would go above 42%, that would be fine. And when it drops, sometimes thatâs based on the quality of products that we see. It moves â itâs kind of a moving target; it really becomes, it really goes to the value of the product and what we see and when we bring it back out to the customer, will she appreciate thatâ¦

Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities
Hi, good evening. Congratulations on a great quarter. I guess the two questions that I have; can you give an update on your thoughts around the Internet and e-commerce and any potential interest internationally?
Michael OâSullivan
Sure. Bob, so on e-commerce, weâve looked at e-commerce a number of times. We continue to monitor whatâs happening in terms of e-commerce, but we donât have any plans to launch an e-commerce business at this point. We operate a $10 average unit retail business, and we just â every which way weâve looked at it, we just donât see how thereâs not an economically sustainable model at that kind of price point. There may be at a much higher price point, but then youâre no longer in the moderate off-price business. So we donât plan to pursue e-commerce at this point. And in terms of international, no â no plans at this point to launch an international business.
Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities
Got it. And then on the category basis, can you talk a little bit about how youâre positioned on an outerwear heading into the fourth quarter?
Barbara Rentler
Sure, our outerwear business, we plan outerwear and seasonally sensitive products in Q3 pretty conservatively. As we get into Q4, we plan it specifically by region. So from what we gather from the micro merchandising, which tells us which regions and which types of products, we take that along with the merchant instinct and what we see in the market. But overall, we feel that outerwear is an opportunity for us as we go forward.
Robert Drbul-Nomura Securities
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Montagna of Avondale Partners. Your line is now open.
Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners
Hi. A question about gift-giving versus last year. Iâm wondering, did you place a bigger emphasis on gift-giving this year? I think thatâs what youâd mentioned on the last call and is that across all categories, or is it primarily in the home category?
Barbara Rentler
Yes. We have increased gift-giving this year. It is primarily in home, but it does go across the parallel into other categories, whether itâs in sweaters or tops or menâs fleece or across the board.
Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners
Okay. And just back to the outerwear question, did you bring it in earlier this year versus last year? Or just curious how it anniversaries versus last year?
Barbara Rentler
Seasonally sensitive product in Q3, we traditionally plan conservatively. And if it sells, since October is kind of a dicey month, if it sells, we go out and we chase it or we pull a pack-away if we have pack-away goods available.
Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners
Iâm referring more to Q4.
Barbara Rentler
Q4?
Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners
Yes.
Barbara Rentler
We feel pretty good about outerwear. Listen, outerwear is one of the areas where we are finding our way and learning as a Company, especially as we move into these colder regions. So our strategy for outerwear this year was really to expand the assortment and to try to really get the regionality correct of heavyweight versus midweight. So we feel pretty good about it.
Mark Montagna-Avondale Partners
Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Patrick McKeever from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.
Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners
Thanks. A question on new store productivity and just new stores in general, since you continue to open 80 to 90 stores. So the question is maybe you could just provide some general commentary around your new store performance. The way I look at it, the new stores are doing about 70% or so of a mature store volume in their first year. So wondering if thatâs accurate, and what youâre seeing on the real estate front, those kinds of things?
Michael J. Hartshorn
So in terms of new store productivity, as weâve entered the new markets, they have fallen a bit, as expected based on customer recognition in those markets. In terms of how theyâre performing versus their plans, weâre pleased with the performance. They actually run ahead of our initial plan.
Michael Balmuth
Patrick, your calculations are about right.
Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners
Okay. And then on the real estate, any changes in terms of whatâs out there? I mean Iâve heard from a few retailers that the commercial real estate market is tightening up a little bit here as the economy continues to improve. Are you seeing that in the locations that youâre targeting as well?
Michael OâSullivan
Well I would say, Patrick, weâre happy with the availability of real estate locations that weâre looking at. We have a very strong real estate team, and theyâre pretty well networked, so we donât see any major issues in terms of real estate availability at this point.
Patrick McKeever-MKM Partners
Okay, all right, well thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs
Thanks, good evening. So just a follow-up on one of the questions that was asked earlier on CapEx next year. Can you remind us of some of the buckets of incremental spending that you had over the past couple of years? And then I guess as a follow-up to that, whatâs the capacity that you have for pack-away at this point?
Michael J. Hartshorn
In terms of CapEx, Stephen, so a base level without the infrastructure investments is somewhere around $400 million to $450 million. This year weâre projecting it to end about $700 million, and that includes the New York buying office for about $222 million and $150 million of BC infrastructure.
Unidentified Company Representative
And Stephen, if you go back to 2012, you can look at base levels there. We added 2013, 2014 we started building BCs that will complete in 2015.
Michael OâSullivan
I mean, the last part of your question, Stephen, on pack-away capacity, we operate a pretty flexible distribution infrastructure in terms of storage, so pack-away capacity is really not a gating factor in terms of how many â what the pack- away pounds can go to.
Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs
Great, thank you. And one other follow-up, if I may. And on your plans for, I mean, not necessarily e-commerce but just digital as a strategy into the holiday or any other things that youâre doing differently as you described them more as youâre anticipating a more promotional environment? Thanks.
Michael OâSullivan
Not a lot of new news in terms of marketing. We have over the last several years devoted more and more of our marketing budget to digital. We see digital as a good sort of proxy for word of mouth, which is kind of something weâve always relied on very heavily, that the customer will spread sort of the â will talk about the great deals they got at Ross with their friends and we see digital as a way of doing that. So weâre doing more of that this year, but other than that, nothing else significant to call out.
Stephen Grambling-Goldman Sachs
Okay, thank you so much, best of luck.
