Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results of the first nine months of 2014. Since our capital market days will start shortly after this presentation. I have to ask for your kind understand that the presentation include in the Q&A will only covered in those nine months results and we will try to keep it hopefully to 45 minutes and we will try.
Please be informed that the presentation material used for the capital market days. Today and tomorrow will be made available on our website at the same time, as they're made available to the participants of the event. Also be kindly reminded, that today we do not only have participants, we have webcast, but also have a live session with an audience here in the room.
We will first answer the questions in the room, before we open the line for questions from the webcast participants. The call will be hosted by our CEO, Dr. Wolfgang BÃ¼chele and Georg Denoke, member of the Executive Board and CFO; also available for your questions will be Professor Aldo Belloni, member of the Executive Board. I will now hand over to Georg Denoke for his presentation.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you, Dominik, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome here to our nine months results presentation. In the first nine months of this year, will be realized revenues of EUR 12 billion, which is slightly above last year's level on a reported basis. Although, US Dollar related negative exchange rate effects began to receive in the third quarter. The adverse impact on growth both significant on a nine months basis. Adjusted for the negative currency impact revenue was up 4.8%.
The comparable growth in our Gases Division accelerated in the third quarter to 3.7%. We generated an operating profit of EUR 2.9 billion, which is on a reported basis 3.3% below the figure of last year and adjusted for currency impacts slightly ahead of last year's figure. This resulted in a group margin of 23%.
The lower margin is a result of the higher share of our Engineering Division in revenue mix as well as higher base effects from an dividend payment that we received in the third quarter last year. We had the strong rebound in operating cash flow in the third quarter and that was generated EUR 2.2 billion in operating cash flow in the nine months period. EPS before for non-recurring items in the third quarter was 7.1% above the level of last year.
On a reported basis, EPS was 18% below the level of the last year. In Q3, we had to realize impairment losses on assets with a total volume of EUR 229 million. The two main adjustments of the asset base were in Brazil and China. As you are aware, we have seen a further decline in economic prospects in Brazil, for that reason we had to reevaluate our asset base, where we impaired EUR 100 million.
On a plant complex, in the chemical trust, Chongqing in China. We had to impair EUR 100 million on the asset which Linde has built together with Chongqing Chemical & Pharmaceutical Holding Company, CCPHC to supply various industry customers. The impairment was caused by a change to the structural set up of the site, which had an impact on both the raw gas available as feedstock and the purchase volumes of the plant.
I will move on to the operational performance now division on Slide 4. Despite headwinds from still unfavorable exchange rates revenues in the Gases Division totaled EUR 10.4 billion. On a comparable basis, growth was 3.1% in the reporting period. In the Engineering Division, we are currently working on the execution of our high order backlog. This is reflected in the increase of revenues by 7.6%.
The Gases Division generated an operating profit of EUR 2.8 billion, 2.6% below the number of the same period of last year, adjusted for the currency headwinds. Operating profit grew by 3.3%, it's 27.3% the margin remained on a high level. The Engineering Division realized operating profit of EUR 216 million, which is EUR 9 million below the very high level of last year. This resulted in a margin of 9.7% remaining well above the industry ever rich and fully in line with our forecast of around 10%.
Following this short summary of the performance, I will now move on more detailed picture of the performance of the Gases Division. Compared to the same period last year, we saw 0.2% impact from higher natural gas prices that slightly diluted margins from an geographical perspective, this effect was more significant in the Americas.
Additionally you see, that the negative impact from currency was still 4.2%. The exchange rate effect in the third quarter only, had a negative impact of around 1% predominantly due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. The underlying price and volume effect in the Gases Division accelerated from 2.4% in the second quarter 3.7% in the third quarter.
This resulted in 3.1% in the reporting period. On the next slide, you see the revenue development in the Gases Division on a comparable basis by product area. Overall the 3.1%, you see in healthcare we achieved growth of 3% held by 6.1% comparable growth in the third quarter. This reflects the strong volume development particularly in our US home care business. Healthcare has showed a steady improvement from quarter-to-quarter as expected.
Tonnage accelerate to a comparable growth of 5.4%, due to start-ups and ramp-ups, which were supported by growth in particular, in this European steel sector. In the third quarter, we also benefited from a low negative impact from maintenance and shutdowns. Due to continue softer development in industrial production growth. In some geographies, the growth rate in our merchant business were affected also in the third quarter.
Positive development in North America, Greater China and Eastern Europe were the drivers for achieving comparable growth of 3.8% in [indiscernible]. In cylinder, the growth was 0.3%, two negative effects are to be mentioned here and you know these already. In the important cylinder market Australia, we continue to see negative comparable volume growth as a result of reduced investments and hence lower construction and maintenance activities in the mining sector.
Since then, the volumes have stabilized on this level. Additionally, strikes in South Africa to continue to effect the volume development there. Now I will move on, on the reporting segments on the following slides starting with Europe, Middle East, Africa.
In EMEA, reported revenue of EUR 4.5 billion was 1.6% below their figure for the prior year period. On the comparable basis, the growth slightly accelerated in the third quarter and was 0.8% in the reporting period. From a geographical perspective, positive contributions from the UK, Middle East and Eastern Europe especially in tonnage.
Despite still modest economic growth in the Euro zone and the slow merchant development. We saw an acceleration of the Cylinder business in September after the weak August. The second reporting segment is Asia-Pac from a nine months perspective, we achieved 5.4% on a comparable basis.
However, reported revenue for the period was 0.7% below last year, mainly due to unfavorable exchange rate effects. The positive development in Greater China in the first half, 2014 continued in the third quarter. Volume increased in all product areas driving double-digit revenue growth in this region.
From an product area perspective, the solid development in Asia Pac was supported by tonnage with ramp-ups and start-ups of new plants. For example in Singapore, Linde brought onstream and on site plant in the third quarter. This plant supplies Avonic [ph] and is a first integrated industry gaseous plant in the country to product Hydrogen, Methane and CO2. As already outlined, in South Pacific and particularly in Australia, the economic environment in the manufacturing industry remained weak and continues to have an adverse impact on growth and particular on the cylinders.
Overall, the region is in a phase of a certain de-industrialization which increases the need to implement right sizing measures in this geography. The third reporting segment is Americas, here revenue was slightly below last year, which is also a result of unfavorable exchange rates as well as soft economic conditions in South America.
The impact from the change of the Venezuelan exchange rate system was communicated already to you in last quarter and totaled to EUR 55 million for the first nine months, 2014. On a comparable basis, revenue increased in Americas by 4.3%.in North America as already indicated, the healthcare business was characterized by continuously strong volume growth throughout the reporting period.
A surprise cut from competitive bidding too in the US, where implemented on the 1, July, 2013. The comparable base was already lower in the third quarter. Therefore strong volume growth in healthcare now becomes fully visible. The positive development in buying [ph] in North America, continued as well.
Also here, I would like to mention a start-up in the third quarter. We increased our production capacity for electronic gases, site in Hillsboro, Oregon, USA to cover the growth demand for high purity nitrogen from customers in the semiconductor industry. In South America, their economic situation did not improve in the first nine months, 2014.
In some countries, the economy continues to be effected by high inflation and relatively low rates of growth. On the next page, Slide 8. We have outlined the profitability of our reporting segments. In EMEA, operating profit grew slightly to EUR 1.344 billion which resulted in an operating margin of 29.9%.
The development was supported by higher contributions from the UK and Middle East. In Asia Pac, we achieved a relatively stable margin of 26.1% currency headwinds, hence the weakness in South Pacific effected the development. Therefore the operating profit decreased by 1.3% to EUR 737 million.
In Americas, in North America the margin was diluted by higher natural gas prices for a reasons of comparison I would like to remind you that in the third quarter, 2013, we received a divided payment from Ikaria. In South America, devaluation in Venezuela and inflation in other South American countries negatively affected operating profit and margin. As the realized operating profit dropped by 11.3% to EUR 756 million and the operating margin held to 23.8%.
I would like to move on to engineering now. This is Slide 9, in our Engineering Division, we achieved an increase in revenue of 7.6%, though operating profit was slightly below last year's level. The realized margin of 9.7% remains above the industry average and in line with the target we have set for the full year.
On a nine months basis, order intake was EUR 2.7 billion. This represents a significant improvement of the order intake compared to the first half of the year. This is the realized [ph] often exceptionally strong order intake of more than EUR 1.6 billion in the third quarter. This context to be mentioned is the major contract awarded in the third quarter by Sibur. The largest petrochemical in Russia.
Following the already completed front end engineering design, the FEED, the contract covers detailed engineering and procurement of components for one of the largest ethylene plant in the world, which is to be built in Tobolsk, in Western Siberia. The new plant is expected to produce around 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene and 525,000 tons per annum of propylene.
As a result of this order around 50% of order intake in the reporting period was for petrochemical plants. Geographically around 85% of the current order intake came from North America and Europe. Order backlog is at a very high level exceeding EUR 5 billion at the end of the third quarter.
After outlining the performance of all division. I would like to move on to the development of the cash flows on Slide 10 and in the third quarter, the cash flow from operating activities was EUR 1.166 billion, an increase of above 20%. The main driver for this significant improvement was the change in working capital by EUR 115 million to EUR 234 million, this was mainly due to higher figure for advance payments receipts from customers in the Engineering Division.
The investment cash flow of minus EUR 353 million was EUR 176 million below the prior year figure and here the adjustment of the contribution from the AP acquisition as we you know and the reverse payment is visible in this line, so that's in the investment cash flow. These items resulted in an increase in free cash flow before financing from EUR 437 million to EUR 813 million.
As a consequence of the strong development of free cash flow before financing, net debt was reduced as you can see on the next slide, Slide 11. In the third quarter, net debt declined by EUR 550 million to EUR 8.7 billion. This debt reduction was supported by the outline positive cash flow development and the dynamic indebtedness factor net debt to EBITDA now stands at 2.2 times.
In August, in order to early refinance and upcoming bond maturity in November. We successfully issued $400 million in private placements with international investors. These capital market transaction allowed us to secure US Dollar financing under very attractive competitions. Overall, our financial debt maturity profile continues to be conservative approximately 50% of the non-current debt has the maturity longer than five years, also debt with the short-term maturities are very limited bonds worth about $420 million will become due over the next 12 months.
This is in November and the refinancing took place in August, as I just explained. The credit ratings remained unchanged at A plus with S&P and A2 with Moody's. the outlook of the both ratings is stable. For the outlook I will now handover to our new CFO. Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
Thank you very much, Georg. On the next slide, on the left-hand side you see that the global economy has grown substantially slower than, was what is expected, but a macroeconomists at the time, when the guidance for 2016 was issued.
You can see that, indeed we are practically one year delayed when it comes industrial production and the current forecast is also not too optimistic as in the most recent months, quite a number of downgrades took place, for Europe but also for other economies. Given this high uncertainty, also in combination with geopolitical conflicts and the overall lower economic prospects, a significant improvement of the overall economic situation is not visible from our side.
And therefore, we have looked at our targets. On the right-hand side, you see the progressively worsening headwinds, we are getting from currencies and I would again then like to remind you, that we are not just talking on the US Dollar, but we are talking also on the South African, Rand, the British, Pound. We are the talking the Venezuelan, Bolivar, the Australian, Dollar and the Brazilian, Real just to mention the most important currencies fall in there.
And therefore, when you over the last two or three months see, a strengthening of the Dollar then obviously that is something, which is only part of the coin we have to address. So overall, as of third quarter, 2014 even when there was a slight improvement with respect to the US Dollar in the last two, three months. We are talking about 400 million negative impact, which brings our original guidance to EUR 4.6 billion in OP.
Due to the outlined reasons, we have decided to modify our outlook for this year. We have adjusted for exchange rate effects and expect on a group level. A solid increase of revenue for the operating profit. We are now expecting, an operating profit at the similar level as we have last year meaning in 2013. Adjusted for exchange rate effect as well as for non-recurring items.
As outlined earlier, in our Gases Division. We are seeing today a moderate revenue growth in 2014 expected again on an adjusted currency basis and for the operating profit, a slight increase. In our Engineering Division, we plan to realize solid revenue development combined with an operating margin, which is around 10% points.
For the medium term targets, I would now like to draw your attention to the next slide. Given the described environment, I have addressed at the beginning. We also have decided to adjust our mid-term outlook and our operating profit target to be moved by one year to 2017. I would like to share with you some more backgrounds on the expected development of the operating profit.
We will see a negative impact from shutdowns of customer facilities, which have not been foreseeable like the upcoming closure of the refinery or a refinery in Australia, which was also the reason for impairment of a customer relationship which we have undertaken with EUR 11 million.
Due to changed economic prospects, in some areas of the world. Also we see our tonnage, customers' to show slower ramp-ups also with a new facilities, then what we had anticipated beforehand and we will see that some of the contracts are ending and one example is in Italy, that contracts are ending without a renewal, which originally was planned.
This is definitely exceptions, rather than the rule, but nevertheless they take place. On the other hand, we see as I said that also the contributions from start-ups and from ramp-ups of new capacities in recent years have experienced due to the current development slower increases in ramp-ups and this is in line with the slower industrial production grows, which we have been guided by the economists in many, even of the growth markets in this growth.
In the emerging markets, the ramp-up rate today is therefore closer to five years, than the originally expected three years, which we have whenever we're planning for some of the projects. In fact, going forward we have to assume that especially the growth in the merchant capacities will come slower and later than expected.
Should of course the IP growth accelerate again, there is a clear upside as we have indicated was the light blue bar in the graph. The same applies for price and volume growth of our existing business and the respective upside. The contribution of our HPO program, the various other efficiency improvement, which we undertake and further restructuring measures, which will be started shall support the operating profit development.
Additionally, we will optimize our portfolio also by means of both on M&A as well as decaptivation, wherever it makes sense. With our new approach, we are confident to achieve between EUR 4.5 billion and EUR 4.7 billion in operating profit in 2017 on the basis of the currently prevailing exchange rates.
Should of course, the exchange rates move in our favor, then there is an upside potential. As just explained, based on the current economic forecast and the exchange rates we target to achieve EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 4.7 billion in 2017. We expect to improve the return on capital employed from 9.7% in 2013 to a range of 11% to 12% in 2017.
A reason for the low ROCE target is partly a result of the outlined slower ramp up of our merchant capacities, in particular to the slower IP growth in emerging markets and also of course, due to delayed tonnage customer ramp-ups, which is due to the same reason. Both of these negative effects will mean, that it will take longer to reach an optimal capacity utilization.
Our HPO program remains unchanged, we target gross cost savings of EUR 750 million to EUR 900 million in the four years from 2013 to 2016. However, as already mentioned we have started to implement additional measures to improve the efficiency and processes as well as to optimize our portfolio and I will explain in the capital markets state, in more detail, what we have initiated.
I ask for your understanding therefore, that I'm not able to give you more detail at this point in time, on these measures, but refer to the next session, which takes place in approximately 1.5 hours. Let me sum up, we have seen a continuation of the low growth environment and do not assume, a significant improvement in return.
The comparable revenue growth of our Gases Division has accelerated from 2.4% in Q2 to 3.7% in Q3. Also the cash flow, came back strongly in the third quarter helped by pre-payments from the Engineering Division, those are very promising signs. On our way forward, we will strongly focus on and also realize sustainable profitable growth and put a lot of energy in the improvement of our efficiency, the optimization of our portfolio and accordingly will make organizational adjustments.
I'm confident, that we are moving in the right direction to create shareholder value. Within this call and also in the following Q&A we will not able to go in much more detail on our way forward. This is subject to the capital markets day, which will follow as I indicated in approximately 1.5 hours, where we are guiding more on the initiatives. We are going to undertake and also with respect to organizational adjustments. We are planning to implement. With this, I would like to hand back to Dominik, in order to guide us with the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Dominik Heger
Thank you, very much. So we take now the questions here in the room first and then open the line. So I think, we have the first question here in the front from Peter Clark, in the third row on the left-hand side.
Peter Clark â Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
Particularly in the emerging markets, you're making quite clear. It's taking five years to load now optimization is somewhere, just wondering how much you thought on recent years. I sort of feel, I know utilization rates, don't work in industrial merchant, but I feel for the utilization rate and then how long it will, you're saying five years to fill, just to get a gage on that because some of your competitors sort of given the stab, at how much they have in terms of utilization, how long they take to over that etc.?
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
The think average industry utilization, when it comes to tonnage, is in the mid 70s and if it comes to the bulk business, we are talking everything between 70% and 80%, that is not something, we however should discuss and I have also explained that in various smaller groups and face-to-face calls. You cannot discuss this on a holistic region basis or on a country basis.
You really have to look in the local power zones and I will elaborate on this concept later in the capital market day in more detail. I will suggest on average our competitors are in similar situation and therefore, there is in my opinion room for cross industry optimization approaches.
Dominik Heger
Okay, so then we have the next question from Rakesh Patel in the last row.
Rakesh Patel â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Just a quick question, I'm just trying to understand the margin decline in the Americas. Can you roughly spit out for us, how much actually came from weakness in Latin America, just getting an idea, I guess of, how much the incremental patience is worth for you, from an operating leverage at Lincare.
Georg Denoke
I think, Rakesh I can take that question here and first of all, you have to deduct a dividend payment I think that is clear, that's roughly 100 basis points from compared to last year, then we have a negative natural gas price effect of 40 basis points and South America is I would say around, roughly 120 basis points and then the remaining part would be the Lincare situation, this is the result, at that stage for the quarter.
Dominik Heger
Okay, so the next question from Thomas Gilbert here in the third row, please.
Thomas Gilbert â UBS Investment Bank
Thank you very much. UBS. Two questions, one in the third, one on the fourth quarter. the tonnage growth accelerated in third quarter, 7% at the time of Q2 call, the outage in Italy was mentioned and the key reason â and now you said that, that might be one of the sides which could be permanently gone. Is that back in operation in the third quarter or did you achieve the 7% without that customer starting up again? That's the first question.
The second question is on the implied fourth quarter operating profit from your revised guidance. I calculated 940, I may get this wrong. I referred to a number that for last year, just about EUR 3.84 billion, 940 would be the weakest quarter with Q1 for the year, where normally Q4 is by far your strongest. So it's just, why is that, please?
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
You'll take the first one and then I'll take the second one.
Georg Denoke
Okay, the onsite I think, is, okay the hydrogen plant is back in operation, but actually the improvement is not solely due to that. I think, we have seen a significant recovery also in the steel industry.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
Let's come to the second question. I think, we were pretty opportunistic when we saw the September figures because September indeed was the strongest months of the whole year and some of you which I met on my road show in one-to-one I said the big question is, is September ramping in on August, which was very weak or is it ramping in July.
It ramped actually in on July, so we were rather optimistic unfortunately, what we have observed in October is a substantial weakening especially in Asia and that's why we have taken a careful stance.
Dominik Heger
Okay, so next question from Mr. [indiscernible]. so to be in the front.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks, [indiscernible]. one question Page 14, for the year 2017. How much of the additional contribution for the individual balance comes from the fact that you have now on additional year, we can add effects from the HPO program, effects from organic growth and so on?
Georg Denoke

I think, the attention of the picture is not to let's say in all details and it's â let's say it's roughly a shift by year. I think that as a point, so you can say that, we are compensating when we go to the midpoint of EUR 4.6 billion, when you compare that with actual currencies, as you know average currencies, then there is EUR 100 million additional contribution, so that additional year.
Without now considering, in a way the potential IP related growth. So we have taken a slightly more conservative view for the year's especially '15 and then a little bit acceleration towards the end of '17 because, when you say that you're losing time for merchant load in the earlier years and more of that comes, on stream or is on stream, then you have that as an compensation towards the end.
If you would add another yes, then also in '18 you would see some of that contribution coming through, right it is not ending in '17. I think this is an explanation I can give to you.
Dominik Heger
Okay and the next question comes from Neil Tyler in the back, third row.
Neil Tyler â Redburn Partners LLP
Thank you, Neil Tyler, Redburn quick question about the Chongqing write down, please. Can you perhaps provide a little bit of detail around the process that you went through to identify the risk to that asset and also whether the contract itself, perhaps was any difference to other contracts in the regional or more broadly and second part of the question is, what would have to transpire for future write-downs on other assets potentially to take place?
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
Let me quickly describe the circumstances and then, Georg will jump in on the procedure, how such an impairment test is triggered and how we, walk through it. What factually is, the original plan in Chongqing. Is that together, we see the PHC, Linde has agreed to develop a [indiscernible] joint venture, where we get raw gas from an affiliate of CCPHC.
This raw gas is now no longer available for reasons, which are attributable to CCPHC and they have instead given the JV another raw gas and that requires or triggers that some of the assets which have been put in the ground are not needed because the newer raw gas can be entered into the facility at a different point.
And this is, what in financial terms is called the triggering event and now I would like to handover to Georg and then later on, I talk to you on the contractual situation.
Georg Denoke
Yes, I think it is going in circles also right, in consideration where you are discussing since, awhile. With especially your partner and at the site and then you would have to come to a conclusion, then you see these kinds of change from the perspective of raw gas available, which then hitting your asset base from the perspective of impure.
Let's say, physical processing perspective. I think on the contractual of course this does not mean that we are walking away through that impairment from our contractual obligation to challenge the situation. I think that's definitely very clear, that means that, some of that what is happening, we anticipated in the contractual terms because otherwise, you don't built onsite.
So why is an impairment coming at the point in time, when you're constructing that. the reason is that, you do not have the upside if the customer disappear, the upside of the period of 15 years normally is a calculation based, you can then assume extension, but at one moment in time.
If one piece is not needed anymore, then that's a situation. So here, definitely we will have talks in continue talks with the partner, but I think from an management and judgment perspective here at that stage. Let's say that we, don't believe it's an easy thing when you go back to the overall plan, then that piece would already be onstream very soon. Let's say that day and therefore, we see this as an appropriate moment in time to put all different scenarios together, of the overall plan there, you have EUR 230 million, to give you an indication and to remind you, what additional components are here included. So we have here at that point in time, to what Dr. BÃ¼chele happened, we have seen that as a major change at the current stage independent of an continued discussion to challenge contracts.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
So just to make clear that there is no misunderstanding, contracts are in place. Now unfortunately, we are in China and therefore, we are preparing and we have to see, how the negotiations with the partner continue. We are preparing arbitration or litigation whatever then finally is the best way forward to enforce the contracts, but nevertheless fact is that due to this change which currently occurred and was the plan being mostly ready and will not be utilized at least part of the facility.
There is no point in the immediate situation not to impair, that is the reason behind the whole thing.
Dominik Heger
Next question comes from Stephan Kippe.
Stephan Kippe â Commerzbank AG
Thank you. First of all coming back to the Americas. One of the reasons for the lower margin is that, was the increase natural gas prices, was that difficult in passing on these costs limited to South America or was that, also a component in North America.
Secondly, coming back to Chongqing. You already had last year a reversal of project in China, is that part of the trend, has the risk when it comes to Chinese project increase a bit and is that impacting your investment positions in China and thirdly, with regards to your guidance and currency. You said that, the currency is now EUR 400 million negative compared to whether, where your former guidance was in 2012.
If I remember correctly, that was also EUR 400 million after the Q2 and sequentially, there has been a bit of improvement Venezuela was also a factor in Q2 already, have you been a bit too optimistic with your Q2 numbers, when it came to the currency impact? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So I can take this question, first of natural gas price is of course mainly North America because is the main consumer of the natural gas and that's the technicality of possible [ph], right more revenues, higher prices, more revenues, lower margins. So that is nothing, where you have to challenge contract.
On the second part on the reversal of an decaptivation, I think that is a great example of an success how you go through this with your customer and how did you get back your money. I think that is a success and rather a confirmation that you can go through contractual situation, successfully in China, but that was a totally different thing because that took place right after the decaptivation and the customer was not really, fully I think appreciating what he had signed and then we said, let's go back and then it was more in technicality on the discussion of how do you have to free taxes in the meantime of the operation, but that is a success.
So I wouldn't say there is any trend of that, through the discussion created with the Chongqing impairment and the currency item, I think is, when you see the movement in Q3 is let's say focusing a little bit too much only on the dollar, Wolfgang's said in his presentation it's not only dollar, so we do have seen deterioration in other currencies and additionally also in third quarter.
Some more hit, in Venezuela. So some of the Venezuelan currency was already visible in Q2, of course, but we have and stronger quarter in Q3, that is the reason for let's say keeping it on the same level because the Dollar was stronger. We would agree, the dollar is strong, but you also have to see that. we are talking the P&L rate as an average rate and we are not talking about spot rates, right?
So that is a situation at the current stage. If you would take spot rates, the number would look different. Of course because you would see the impact as you see it in the balance sheet and you have seen that through currency a EUR 1 billion comes through the change in currency in that period. So that's the case.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
And may need to be absolutely clear, we will continue to invest in China. However, we will be selective with respect to the geography, where in China, are we investing and we are selective with respect to the customer, we are investing for.
Dominik Heger
Okay, next question comes from Sebastian Satz, in the third row.
Sebastian Satz â HSBC
Thanks very much. I also two questions, please and first on the 2017 EBITDA average and If I'm not mistaken, it looks as if you expect similar contributions from new plant start-ups as well as from the existing asset base. If I'm not mistaken, in the past two years to three years most of your growth actually has come from plant start-ups and your existing asset base is been more or less flat.
So do you expect an acceleration, the existing asset base and if so why and the second question, is on the new 2017 target. I don't fully get, why you lower your ROCE by a percentage points and if you have the same amount of earnings, why is the ROCE coming down, can you just talk me through that please? Thank you.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
Let me quickly take the first question and then I think, Georg will take the ROCE. I made it very clear that and we will discuss that in the capital market's day in more detail. The cylinder business is a very profitable business and therefore, we are planning clearly to focus more on cylinder density in our existing sites, in our existing facilities and we will explain to you later in more detail, how we are approaching this market, that something which was not that prominent in the very recent year and this is why, we believe that we are able to increase, not just our business based on new plants coming on stream, but also and even stronger than before based on existing assets, which we have in operation and we still have spare capacity because the assets are not fully loaded.
Georg Denoke
One addition to that, I mean this is an slide which is a structural slide, right? Please don't take now for the centimeter and put a calculation. So, it's more these as the events, with the combination we will see and IP can give additional upside and load can give additional upside, when it comes faster.
I think that's also important to understand because it's nothing, where it look, all these components are in a way, not well known. I think the first component we put in that's short-term because we will experience on short-terms as pointed out, that is something we have to mention. So the starting point will be at more difficult one, when these things are coming through.
One the ROCE perspective, it's a calculation, right? I mean, you can do the math in many directions, but the most important point is a more cautious assumption of load, that one a bigger asset base because we have still significant asset under construction. I think, that's important to understand, we are close to EUR 2 billion for the nine months period of assets under construction and that is coming through the period and I think this is also through customers viewpoints in certain events then a little bit later than earlier.
And then you have the additional merchant delay because you assume not anymore up to previous you assume up to let's say, one years to two additional years that is then, eating into the ROCE. Traditionally, the ROCE always have to challenge as you know that, when you are taking spot rates in your balance sheet, then you have the capital employee base going up more aggressive and volatile for a year average, right that's also the point.
So you never know, that at the yearend, when currency is stronger that's just good for us, of course when dollar is stronger, more dollar inflow that is what we like about on a yearend perspective, also for the short-term perspective in '14. Is probably the assumptions dollar will become stronger, which means capital employed will be more aggressive at the yearend, but on your average exchange rate for the P&L. you're not coming through in such a year.
So I think we learned also the lesson, that of course we have pointed out I think in 21013 wisely this is before currency exchange rate, but nevertheless absolute numbers, right? So people we had to explain a lot and then we had to reduce the EUR 5 billion against actual currencies to EUR 4.6 billion, so that's also something you have to have on mind.
Therefore we thought that, of course the currency comes as an upside, but also in range is more favorable really to guide you, in the perspective of the next three years period.
Dominik Heger
Okay, next question from Norbert Barth
Norbert Barth â WestLB
It is concerning perhaps Linde people little bit, how the project pipeline has developed and also, then on the future CapEx, so you believe that you really on no more course, so really coming down to formally what you had compensate yet go, 13% flat is that aim for the next year and the third question is regarding gain a little bit, the outlook for the regions like you mentioned Asia was really weak in October, but also perhaps a little bit how Russia is developing, it looks is that gaining also downwards momentum as prior to still occur there.
So what we see overall in the economy, so do you believe that will continue also watching '15 and what especially was in Asia, China. The week is, what is the overall or special situation, what you realize for your business?
Georg Denoke
I think, we never walked from the 13%, we had 13% last and that were for good reasons because we have seen some more significant area investments in certain geographies and for certain application. So the 13% plus, I think is in okay guidance for the future. and we have come through a very high period of about 15% CapEx sales ration and I'm talking CapEx sales guesses, of course, right?
On the pipeline, of course you will see that the pipeline has in the first instance and we will talk about that I think also at the capital market day here. So but the pipeline will receive a hit in the next year, where you saw a EUR 900 million that will become an EUR 800 million because of the trenching impairment, right?
That is very clear and for the rest of the pipeline have not changed dramatically and therefore, I think we are still in an pace where more onsite, on stream CapEx will come on stream for '15, '16 and then will peak '17, '18 probably depending on the acceleration of load.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
But we are clearly, as we are committed to that. we will share with you the investment process, which we are going to use looking forward in order to make sure, that we are selective and that we manage project in the best possible way.
Dominik Heger
Okay, so I don't any further questions. We have one last question from the floor.
Unidentified Analyst
Bill Cross [ph] [indiscernible]. you mentioned little contract shutdowns raises the question of, whether the business, the gas and services businesses much there is any in terms of predictability of the gas and services business or is there, no change in terms of the frequency of contract endings.
Georg Denoke
I think, it is no change honestly. I would rather say that, the outsourcing trend will increase, when you see this from an perspective of focus of companies. Additionally, I think when you take these two example if you have to add, of course something which we did not point out too aggressively.
The [indiscernible] contract is one of this very first contract of Linde, when they were moving into onsite on an Hico [ph] case. So you can assume that, this contractual situation, where we are in is not our normal contractual situation honestly. So here that was an moment, where Linde wanted to move into that and therefore, there was this clause available for the customer that they could trigger that.
Therefore, that's not a normal contract I would like to point that out and that is going into the trend that, outsourcing and onsite, was at that point in time more than 15 years ago, was developed from that end and then the, the second one here. We wouldn't talk about the EUR 11 million again, Balva [ph] Island impairment honestly. If we wouldn't have for purchase price allocation reasons and metrics. I think it was the right metrics.
I have to remind you that. when we distribute, you see acquisition in 2006, you have to work with some assumptions and statistically probably more than 90% of all onsite plans, are going to extension and that's a reason, why we applied that, the economy in Australia has changed dramatically since then and that, distribution is in, Asia today cheaper that you can focus more on upscale plan and on below average plans from an Australian economy perspective, that's the reason.
So the EUR 11 million, I would not consider at the change at all from an contractual onsite opportunity case. Also when we talk about opportunities, I think that is really unchanged and contracts are in average, as you would expect them to be.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
And clearly, I would go even one step further, when it comes to the Australian case. It's because of changes in the logistics environment that our customer is shutting down a complete refinery because it's more economical to supply the respective gasoline, fuel by ship from Southeast Asia rather than run a subscale refinery, which was extremely economical 20 years ago.
Dominik Heger
Okay, one very final last question from Mr. Satz.
Sebastian Satz â HSBC
Sorry just a quick follow-up. And impairment Australia, you talked about the structural decline in Australia, how large is the risk, we see it just on impairments there? Thank you.
Wolfgang BÃ¼chele
I would suggest you, should not expect impairments there, but what you can expect is restructuring charge, and we have already indicated that we are not just talking, when we talk about special items on the impairment. We have now booked. We also said that, we still go to book certain restructuring charges that you're currently working and Australia is clearly, a geography where we proactively want to change our structure to right size to downscale our structure in anticipation of an overall, not extremely positive. So now that you're going forward.
Georg Denoke
And only to be also very clear. The impairment losses, you have seen here against the asset base, right these are not goodwill impairments, I pointed out because of other communication. I think that's important to understand.
Dominik Heger
Okay, so we had now full hour and I would say, we close the session.
Unidentified Analyst
One last question.
Dominik Heger
No we close the session, we don't have any Q&A's in the call. There are no questions in the call. So thank you very much for participating and for those here in the room. We will have coffee outside and we will start in roughly an hour with the capital market day. Thank you very much.
Georg Denoke
Thank you, bye, bye.
