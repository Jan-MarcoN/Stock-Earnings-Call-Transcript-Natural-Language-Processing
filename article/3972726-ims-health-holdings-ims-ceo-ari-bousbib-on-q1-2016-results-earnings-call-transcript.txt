Welcome to the IMS Health First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tom Kinsley
Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone. Take you for joining as to discuss IMS Health's first quarter 2016 performance. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we will be referencing the presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcasts. This presentation will also be available following the call on the Events and Presentation section or of our Investor Relations website. The link to the Investor Relations website is located in the lower right-hand corner of our company's website, IMSHealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance and our expectations and prospects and are based on our views as of today, May 3, 2016. Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are, in fact, achieved, will depend upon future events. Some of which are not within the control of the Company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
During this presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, unlevered free cash flow and gross leverage ratio. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material non-cash, unusual or non-recurring items and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. 
These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results, as reported under U.S. GAAP.
With that, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining our 2016 first quarter earnings call. As you know, we announced some great news this morning and we're very excited about it. Obviously, we still have a business to run, so this call will focus on reviewing our Q1 earnings. Because there is so much else going on this morning, we will keep our prepared remarks and the Q&A period somewhat crisper than normal. However, our investor relations team will be available as normal to take your follow-up questions after the call. I'm pleased to report that our first quarter of 2016 is another quarter of consistent strong performance at IMS. Let's review the numbers.
For the quarter, revenue grew 25% at constant currency. Tech services revenue was up 46% and Info up 9%. Adjusted EBITDA growth was about 9.5%. Of course, this growth rate included the Cegedim acquisition, as well as a primary market research acquisition we closed earlier this year, AlphaImpactRx. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, revenue grew 7.2% at constant currency driven by 15.8% growth in tech services and information revenue grew about half a point. The tuck-in acquisitions contributed just over half of the core 7.2% revenue growth. Most of these acquisitions were in technology services and they represented less than half the 15.8% core tech services revenue growth. So organic tech services growth continues to be solidly in the high-single digits.
Emerging markets revenue increased 28% and developed markets grew 25% at constant FX. And if we exclude Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx, revenue grew 10.6% in emerging markets and 6.5% in developed markets, again at constant foreign currency rates. We have a number of important wins during the quarter. A couple examples include a deal with a top pharma that we've combined the strength of IMS real-world evidence information, technology and services. Under this new multi-year contract, we plan to gain broader access to anonymous patient level real-world data. The plants will utilize our E360 tech platform and will receive support from our globally distributed expert resources. On the tech side, our SaaS application suite continues to gain traction. During the quarter, for example, we had 22 Mobile Intelligent CRM wins, of which 16 were competitive wins. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron Bruehlman, Senior VP and CFO to take you through the financials in more detail.
Ron Bruehlman
Thanks, Ari and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. Let me walk you through the details. Revenue grew to $774 million in the first quarter, an increase of 25.2% on a constant currency basis, with tech services offerings growing 45.8% and information offerings increasing 9%. Our reported revenue growth was lower than constant currency growth, as FX continued to be a headwind, but less so than in prior quarters. Total reported revenue growth was 22.5% during the quarter with tech services revenue growing 43.6% and information revenue up 6%.
Excluding the impact of the final quarter of the Cegedim roll-in and the AlphaImpactRx acquisition which we made in Q1, our overall constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, with tech services offerings growing 15.8% which again, reflected solid double-digit growth across our tech services offerings portfolio. Once again, growth in our real-world revenues offerings was particularly strong. On the same basis, information's offering revenue grew 0.4% at constant currency and this was against a tough prior year compare. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, we had strong information revenue growth due to the timing of ad hoc sales. We'll talk briefly of revenue by geography. During the quarter, developed markets revenue grew 24.7% at constant currency and emerging markets 28.1%. At actual FX, developed markets grew 23.3% and emerging markets 18.3%.
The FX impact on the year-over-year growth rates was greatest in emerging markets, as currencies such as the Brazilian real, the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso have weakened versus the dollar during the past year. Now, excluding the Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx acquisitions, emerging markets grew 10.6% and developed markets 6.5%, at constant currency. As you know, April 1 marked the anniversary of the Cegedim acquisition. So, this is the last quarter we will highlight Cegedim's contributions to our revenue growth. Moving down the P&L, adjusted EBITDA $236 million for the quarter, that's up 9.4% at constant currency and 9.3% on a reported basis. FX had a smaller impact in the quarter on adjusted EBITDA than on revenues because of differences in the margins of our various geographies.
As a reminder, the margin compression we experienced during the quarter was expected and was a result of absorbing the unfavorable impact of much lower margins from acquired businesses and this was partially offset by continued cost reduction and restructuring activity in the core Business. GAAP net income was $43 million during the quarter, compared with $298 million last year. And the year-over-year bearance was driven entirely by a one-time tax item last year. You'll recall that during the first quarter of 2015, we began asserting that are non-U.S. earnings would be an indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., with the Company no longer accruing taxes on those foreign earnings at the higher U.S. rate. This resulted in a $256 million non-cash income tax benefit in last year's first quarter from a one-time reduction in our deferred tax liability.
GAAP diluted Earnings per Share for the quarter were $0.13, compared with $0.86 in the prior-year quarter and again, the driver of this variance was principally the benefit from the one-time tax item that we had last year. Adjusted net income which we calculate using cash taxes with $140 million in the quarter increased, versus prior year 6.4% at constant currency and 3.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.42 in the first quarter, that was up 9.5% constant currency and 6.3% reporting. Let's turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. As March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $378 million and the principal amount of debt was $4.6 billion resulting in net debt of $4.2 billion. Net cash used in operating activities was $15 million in the first quarter, compared with cash provided as $30 million in the first quarter of 2015.
You will recall that Q1 cash flow is seasonally weak as we pay our annual bonuses to inflate in this quarter. The decline versus prior year was primarily due to several items, one of which was a large upfront investment and specialty data. We also had higher restructuring-related severance payments and cash payments associated with the loyalty card programs we manage on behalf of our clients. And regarding those programs, these came from businesses that we did not own in the first quarter of last year, that we acquired subsequently. And keep in mind, as I mentioned before, inflows and outflows of the loyalty card programs tend to balance out over the course of the year. They just happen to be negative in this quarter. Capital expenditures in addition to deferred software of $39 million increased by $7 million versus the first quarter of 2015.
Unlevered free cash flow for the first quarter was positive $37 million for the quarter or positive $53 million adjusting for the loyalty card program. Now, let's turn to 2016 guidance and we will start with the full year. We're reaffirming our full-year constant currency guidance which is revenue growth at 10% to 12%, adjusted EBITDA growth at 7.5% to 9.5%, adjusted net income growth of 6.5% to 8.5% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8.5% to 10.5%. Now, after discussing FX headwinds for the past two-plus years, I'm pleased to say that we're raising our full-year reported guidance, due to some recent improvements in foreign currency rates.
Assuming foreign exchange rates hold at current levels through the end of 2016, we expect full-year reported revenue growth at 9% to 11%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5% to 9.5%, adjusted net income growth at 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 6% and all of those metrics are up a point and a half, percentage point and a half versus the prior guidance. You will note that FX impacts adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS more than it does adjusted EBITDA and let me explain. The principal driver there is that our FX hedges which are two in nature; one, our substantially euro denominated interest expense; and secondly, forward contracts we have on our foreign royalty payments. These will turn negative during the balance of the year; current FX rates hold. These impacts come below the adjusted EBITDA line.
Of course, we all know that FX rates can and will change. So, we may need to update our reported guidance during the balance of the year. This is our best view, based on where rates are today and assuming they hold. Okay. For Q2, specifically, our constant currency guidance is for revenue growth at 7.5% to 8.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 5% to 6%, adjusted net income growth of 4.5% to 5.5% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. Again, assuming current foreign exchange rates hold through the end of the second quarter our Q2 reported or actual currency guidance is for, revenue growth at 7.5% to 8.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth at 6.5% to 7.5%, adjusted net income growth of 1% to 2% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 2% to 3%.
Finally, we're reaffirming our 2016 unlevered free cash flow guidance of between 70% and 80% adjusted EBITDA. In summary, this quarter was much like our prior quarters, with double-digit growth across the technology services portfolio. Excluding the impact, of course, of the Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx acquisitions and solid high-single-digit organic technology services growth. Continued momentum in real-world evidence in tech and apps including, a number of important contract wins; continued solid earnings growth; reaffirmation of our constant currency guidance; and with a little bit of help from FX, increasing our reported guidance. Of course, we're pleased to be reporting strong numbers on top of the planned merger with Quintiles which we believe is a transformational deal for both companies.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for our Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. 
Peter Appert
Ari or Ron, can you give us any more granularity on the revenue drivers within tech services? I know you highlighted real-world evidence, et cetera, but any specifics?
Ari Bousbib
Yes, as always, tech and apps and real-world evidence were the faster-growing issues of our three main areas. While we have tech and apps, we have real-world evidence that we have in the labor-based services, work from analytics and consulting and it was basically good growth across the different offerings. But particularly strong on real-world evidence and on tech and apps.
Peter Appert
Is it possible to give specific percentages in terms of the growth rates in those particular areas?
Ron Bruehlman
On a core basis, they were all double-digit growth in the quarter. There was some benefit of tuck-in acquisitions in those numbers and when I said core, I mean excluding Cegedim and AlphaImpactRx. But even excluding those tuck-in acquisitions, overall, solid high-single-digit organic growth for tech services.
Peter Appert
Ron, can you remind me on the organic tech services growth, ex the tuck-under deals, has high-single digit been consistent for the last several quarters? I'm recalling it might have been double digits in prior quarters.
Ron Bruehlman
No, it has been pretty consistent, high-single digit, actually, remarkably consistent high-single digit.
Peter Appert
Okay.
Ari Bousbib
I'm sorry, Peter. With respect, we have a lot of questions in the line. You have three questions. Why don't you ask the fourth one on a follow-up with the IR team? We'll go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. 
Jamie Stockton
Maybe just as a follow-up on the tech services business. Can you give us a little more detail on what some of these tuck-in deals are that drove half of the tech services growth during the period?
Ron Bruehlman
There are workflow analytics area, some in services, some of them are tech related. I don't believe we had any in the management consulting area. And I think we had a little bit of contribution in real-world evidence. It is not in any one area. It is really pretty much across the portfolio.
Jamie Stockton
And then, maybe one question on the merger, if you will. I apologize if I missed this on the other call. The $100 million of costs synergies, can you talk about how those are going to specifically be driven? You guys have done a great job of moving work to some of your global centers of excellence on the IMS side of the business. Is it essentially going to be, to some extent, a repeat of that, incrementally focused on the Quintiles business? Any color on that would be great.
Ari Bousbib
Yes, you are on the mark. We're two large companies, with big cost structures. It is natural that there will be some overlapping SG&A in many parts of the world. They are in many countries, we're in many countries, there is overlapping IT infrastructure and support and you are correct from a production and operations point of view. We each have global delivery centers that have been set up offshore. We believe that the utilization of those can be increased and generating good efficiencies across the board. That is the usual and traditional sources of synergies, again, $100 million, we have very good [indiscernible] on this, again. Geographic overlaps, administrative costs, duplicative technology infrastructure, utilization of development and production centers offshore which both of us have done and doing a better job of accelerating these in for the combined company.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Steinerman
I want to talk to you about the faster growth, the 100 to 200 basis points that should come out of the combined organization by year three. Is that a better deal for Quintiles than IMS? In other words, are we going to see the 100 to 200 basis points on the IMS's business? So, if you could speak to your long term, medium term growth of mid-single digit constant currency organic, including one point of M&A, is that going to be 100 to 200 basis points better when we get to the end of year three?
Ari Bousbib
Obviously, once we're closed, we're operating as one company. So, there won't be IMS and Quintile, there will be Quintiles IMS. And when we talk about incremental growth, revenue coming from the combination, we mean to say that the combined company, we're regrowing at 1 to 2 points higher rate than in combination and that we have simply added the two companies together. If you do the math, over and above our current residue growth, as you reminded us, of mid-single-digit top-line revenue growth and the top-line revenue growth of Quintiles, over and above that, if you do the math, obviously there will be a ramp, right? It is not going to happen right away. But exiting year three, at the midpoint of that range, it represents somewhere in the $400 million to $500 million incremental revenue, over and above what we would have arise at separately.
You could assume a nice drop through rate on that which is in the 30s. And we've modeled that very expansively and, obviously, you can imagine it has been our established practice here to underpromise and overdeliver. Look, there are examples of companies in the clinical development area where the use of data has been shown to lead to higher win rates in incremental revenues. And when we compare what these two companies bring to the table to those other examples, it is not on the same planet. Okay. We bring a record of over 0.5 billion anonymized patient level data assets. 
There simply is nothing that comes close, it's on a global basis. when you put this to work at the service of clinical development optimization at the design phase of the execution phase, you are going to see significant gains, I believe in market share. We feel strongly about this. This is one key lever of the revenue growth. The second one, so to answer your question specifically, is on the Quintiles side of the ledger, but, clearly, we're enabling it. On the real-world evidence side, the second most significant lever, that's really a combination. Our real-world evidence business is slightly larger than theirs, but in combination, we're formidable player in the marketplace when we combine our capabilities and our customer reach.
We believe that the combined capabilities accelerate the momentum of each of our businesses, so that, if you will, the benefit of the incremental growth, the crux to both sides. Finally, on the commercial side, we think that the opportunities for outsourcing which we have been essentially riding on the trend of pharma companies, increasingly looking to partner with providers that can provide the analytics support and technology support for their go-to-market activities. Now Quintiles brings to the table an actual field force and it brings to the table additional advisory capabilities which we're going to look to productionize, feel to what we've done with our own consulting business. 
We've focused on standardized processes and we've repeatable, higher-margin, lower-cost offshore actual delivered standardized processes and we're going to replicate that across the Quintiles portfolio. In a way, it's simply leveraging what we've done or what we're in the process of continuing to benefit from, across a broader base of business. It's not either one side or the other. It's really on both sides of the ledger. 
We, again, are very excited. It is not our practice to rely on revenue synergies when we do a deal, because interestingly, this is one of those quite unique moments where I think you are putting together two extraordinary companies and creating a game-changing one. And because it is unique, we're going to spend the time with you and colleagues and investors and explain why we believe this is really transformative. It's innovative and it's going to lead to superior growth profile and great returns for our shareholders.
Operator
Our next question comes from Steven Wardell with Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Steven Wardell
I'm wondering, are there any regulatory approvals that you foresee that you will need in the U.S. or internationally?
Ari Bousbib
Well, there's customer re-approvals, including antitrust and so on, we do not foresee any issues here. Again, this is the joining of highly-complementary businesses. Quintiles serves, primarily, not exclusively, primarily, the clinical development side of the house. We service primarily the commercial side. It does create a unique combination.
As soon as we end the call here, our lawyers are going to continue to work on the regulatory filing, we don't expect any issues. We operate in many jurisdictions. So, it is just procedurally going to be processed and it will take some time and that's why we said we anticipate a close some time in the second half of 2016, most likely in the fall. That is what we're aiming for. So, again, we don't have to deal with any issues, just traditional customary regulatory approvals.
Steven Wardell
And then you discussed how IMS has a retrospective analysis capability with real-world evidence and Quintiles has a perspective primary data collection capability and that creates a distinct capability. Can you give us an example of how this would make a more attractive product for a customer, just to help us understand this better?
Ari Bousbib
The best way I can say this is, we're providing something but it has holes. And Quintiles is providing something else and it also has holes and it happens to be that their holes are where we're covered and our holes are where they cover. Traditionally, if we're the only provider of that particular study, we're going to provide something and the client is going to have to go out or request that we go and do some custom work because Quintiles has done these studies, empirical studies extensively, we have that at our fingertips.
Conversely, when Quintiles does studies, they are missing data and they have to go out and either buy data or work with third parties to try to bring it in. Our goal, again, is very consistent with what we've done in the IMS. Bear in mind, IMS has a data business and what was called a consulting and services business which was, again, a series of discrete transactional studies. We moved our business model to a data business that then enables and powers up productionized solutions, that is what's scalable. That's what creates revenue growth and market share gains and that's what's created a strong profit drop through and we would like to do the same on the product development side and on the real-world evidence side.
And we believe there is great opportunity to do that. When you bring together real-world evidence, the breadth and efficiency of retrospective data and the depth of prospective data, you got the magic sauce. We bring breadth and Quintiles brings depth to the issue and we think that's just unparalleled, unmatched set of capabilities when put together.
Operator
Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik
I guess we don't have an in-depth pharma background here. When I understood your strategy, especially with the CROs, I always thought it was more an alliance strategy. And I can somewhat understand Quintiles benefiting from having all the data in their hands, exclusively and maybe benefiting that. Trying to understand from IMS's strategy, why doesn't it make more sense to license your data to all the CROs, price it higher, as if that valuable and make it accretive, that way, as opposed to owning the CR asset itself?
Ari Bousbib
You can imagine we ask ourselves that question many times. The data is valuable, not because it's the data. It's not the data, it's what you do with it. And our modeling has concluded that it is best to participate in the economic upside of selling the solution powered and differentiated by the data. We've had the same dilemma on the commercial side. We used to, transactionally, on a discrete basis, sell the data to solution providers that essentially captured, sometimes with very limited value add, a big portion of the total economic value delivered to the client by leveraging the data. 
When you just sell the data, it is hard to price into the transaction the value that's captured by the solution provider. And, secondly, the solutions market which we call it broadly, is a much larger market. Much larger market, that is data market itself. The reason is, the same data enables a wide spectrum of applications. So, in the same way that we've moved into the commercial space and the analytics space and the technology space on the commercial side, we would like to similarly create that differentiation on the product development side. It happens to be that, jointly, Quintiles and ourselves believe that the industry, their side of the industry, is very ripe for efficiency improvements and transformation.
As we said on the merger call, it's an industry that has been relatively static and for good reason. It is more regulated, it's highly process intensive, but a lot of these processes were largely manual and idiosyncratic to the studies. It has great potential for technology enablement, automation and certainly a great opportunity for differentiation through data. If we saw the data as sometimes we do today, every single time would be a custom type of development. By being together, we can productionize that.
We're going to work on building the data mining algorithms that are necessary to push-of-a-button generate the targeting of sites and optimize the clinical trials design and execution. That is the difference, and we, in our modeling and our scenarios, have concluded that the value, the strategic and economic value to be the value of putting the two companies together is dramatically greater by merging with Quintiles.
Manav Patnaik
If I could just ask Ron, just a follow-up, just to make sure that we're all on the same page. In terms of the organic growth this quarter, excluding all deals, can you tell us what that was exactly total in the tech services?
Ari Bousbib
I think I said that on the remarks.
Ron Bruehlman
We didn't give the exact number, but we gave you enough to get close. 7.2% is the core growth. We said a little bit more than half of that was due to the tuck-in acquisitions. Just over half. And almost all those acquisitions were in the tech services space. So, from that you can and we said high-single digits for the tech services. So, I think you have everything you need there.
Operator
And next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. 
John Kreger
Two quick questions, both deal-related. I think you guys have talked about an opportunity for a tax savings of about $35 million from the combination, I just wanted to clarify that that is an annual number and will there be a phase-in effect of that? And then also, Ari, the patient assets coming from EMR and so forth, I think the number was about $530 million. How broadly is that, can you say where those are geographically? I assume a lot of those are not in the U.S.. Thank you.
Ron Bruehlman
I will do the tax one first and then I'll turn it over to Ari. The tax number is an annual number. We have about, at IMS, a total of over $350 million of deferred U.S. tax assets. These are net operating loss carry forwards in foreign tax credits that are unutilized. We can use those to offset Quintiles' tax bill by $35 million each year into of 2020. So, it is an accelerated tax benefit. Obviously, we were going to use the tax benefits over time anyway, but we will use them more quickly, so there will be an acceleration benefit.
Ari Bousbib
I believe of the 530, I think my recollection is a $240 million of those are in the U.S.. The rest are overseas in the major markets. Again, it is a very significant data asset and there's nothing that comes close, nothing.
Tom Kinsley
I appreciate the call and thank you very much for your time today. And as always Andrew and I will be available after the call to take any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.
