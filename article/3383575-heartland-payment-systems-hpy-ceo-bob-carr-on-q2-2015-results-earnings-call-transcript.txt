Good morning and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.
Now Iâd like to turn the conference to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO and Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman.
Before we begin I would like to remind you that some of our discussions might contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represents managementâs beliefs and assumptions concerning future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statement due to many factors.
Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Please note that we have posted our statistical supplements to the IR section of Heartlandpaymentsystems.com, which includes details on our consolidated results and business segments net revenues and operating results. There is also a presentation that Bob Carr will use during his remarks. This presentation is also available in the IR section on our website and can be accessed via the link provided in the press release this morning. I suggest you access the link and pull the slides to follow Bobâs remarks.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Bob Carr
Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. Iâd like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland.
The second quarter was the most profitable quarter in the history of Heartland Payment Systems. Net revenue grew by 28% and adjusted net income and adjusted EPS increased by 98% and 24% respectively. Whatâs most exciting is that the growth in net revenue, earnings and many other key financial and operating statistics accelerated this quarter as we continue to install record volumes of new business, reduce attrition and add strategic acquisitions that complement our core operations. Samir will go through the financial results in more detail in a minute.
In June, we crossed the $8 million mark and installed $8.2 million of installed margin, a year-over-year increase of 14.5%. As we have demonstrated over the past several years, this steady quarter after quarter increase in new business is the key to transaction volume processing growth and ultimately card processing net revenues. As can be clearly seen in our guidance, we are on pace to grow net revenue by $120 million, in part using the proven sales model first introduced back in 1994 and by making sound investments that resulted in building substantial value-added businesses.
What is incredibly exciting to me is that we are just scratching the surface of the potential market share and growth opportunities available to us. I am pleased to see all of the key revenue drivers and KPIs across all business segments being Card Processing, Payroll, Heartland School Solutions and Campus continue to accelerate and achieve records levels quarter after quarter. And through the creation of Heartland Commerce we have opened vast new growth opportunities. So with that Iâd like to focus the balance of my comments this morning on Heartland Commerce and our involving new distribution model. And for this you might want to turn to the slide deck thatâs available by - on the URL thatâs in the press release this morning and weâll start with slide one.
Heartland Commerce is more than a new business segment for Heartland. Heartland Commerce is Heartlandâs response to future growth and to better serving our existing merchant base. Merchant requires are in a vortex of the whirlwind of change that is so well known in todayâs world. If acquirers donât adapt, we will become irrelevant sooner than later.
Heartland has chosen to maintain its fundamental core business model while building the infrastructure we believe is necessary to provide the best portfolio of products and services available to the SME marketplace today and tomorrow.
The focus of my comments this morning will be Heartlandâs new approach to our distribution model for payment services and other business services such a payroll, loyalty gift, managed network services, labor management, employee scheduling, reservations, weight management, online ordering, lending, data analytics and new customer origination. Please move to slide two.
It is well known that Heartland has the most effective feet on the street distribution model in the industry. I know this because of all the incoming calls I receive from different businesses wanting Heartland to provide distribution of their products and services across the country. As I mentioned earlier but it bears repeating, last month, we installed more than $8.2 million of margin which translates into more than $10 million of annual net revenues of payments, payroll and gift and loyalty services. This represents $1.5 billion of processing volume added to our portfolio.
We are running at an annual pace at $20 billion of new volume and $120 million of net revenue with our proven sales model that dates back to 1994. What is incredibly exciting to me is that we are not even close now to being finished with growing the sales organization. We are just scratching the surface of the market share of available payment and payroll opportunities, not to mention all of the other business services that Heartland Commerce opens to us. We fully expect our monthly installation numbers to keep growing for many years and to come - for many years to come, and Heartland Commerce is a big reason for that confidence. Letâs move to slide three.
With the acquisitions of Liquor POS, Xpient, pcAmercia and Dinerware, we also acquired their dealer networks. We are excited to have these new distributors for our POS and to welcome them as product specialists to support the Heartland sales organization. Many years ago, Heartland decided to focus its organic growth with W-2 full-time exclusive sales professionals. That model has taken us far, but any single channel distribution model has its limitations.
The major limitation for us is that many sales professionals are just not very good at selling multiple complex products. We started in the Payroll business back in 1999 and for the first 14 to 15 years have relied on our exclusive sales force to sell both Payments and Payroll. We didnât do horribly in growing both of these businesses, but Payments grew much faster than Payroll.
Before we acquired Ovation at the end of 2012 we had finally achieved a Payroll portfolio of 10,000 clients, all organically generated with our single-channel sales team. At the same time, however, we grew our Payments platform 10 times faster with that same sales team. I am happy to say that today we have more than 33,000 Payroll clients and more than 275,000 Payments clients despite our inability to be as effective in selling multiple products, as we would like.
Many salespeople want to become experts in certain niches and not become distracted by having to learn a new business or even a new market. We would prefer that it be otherwise but we have learned much from these experiences. Enter the SPA model, the special product advisor, which we introduced into our sales organization two years ago in a big way.
Long ago we divided the nation into 100 geographical divisions and our initial goal was to develop each division so that on average each would add $100,000 of new margin each month to our portfolio. I am happy to report that we are getting very close to surpassing this goal in a very big way because we are introducing the SPA concept into Heartland Commerce by identifying the very best dealers who in effect one, service our POS SPAs and two, to service our local servicing arm and our 100 divisions. We believe this combination of these two channels will be powerful.
Over the years Heartland has worked with many dealers and many ISVs in effective ways. However as alternative distribution models have developed, many of these dealers chose to work with our competitors because they were offered more money. Very simple. While we did not and still do not believe that some of these levels of payments are sustainable, we have learned that many of these dealers, but not all, can make valuable contributions to Heartland and now more than ever with our newest POS products.
The true dealer offers local support and service, trains the merchant on the use of the various software modules available on the POS. They will replace broken printers and update hardware with their onsite service staff. These are valuable services offered by true POS dealers. While the move to tablet POS is deemed by some observers to leave these dealers out in the cold, it is certainly unproven that the internet-only strategy of distribution and service is sustainable or even viable for the vast majority of established businesses. Many of these true POS dealers are better at servicing then they are at sales. Enter the Heartland sales organization. The true dealer is often able to serve as the spa for our sales organization, the expert. The world is already much too complex for any one person or any one organization to provide best in class services for the multitude of services that can be supported by a cloud-based POS product.
Heartland is already working with some POS dealers to have them serve as our spas for POS. We are also working with competitive ISVs and their dealers. No one, including Heartland Commerce, will ever have the best-in-class POS product for every merchant and no single-service provider will be able to offer the best-in-class services to all merchants.
With the rapid changes in technology, todayâs best-in-class product may be tomorrowâs obsolete product. Heartlandâs goal is to be the best-in-class payments and payroll provider for SMB merchants. Letâs look at what we are doing for POS vendors and merchants as we speak. We are deploying our best-in-class EMV and Out-of-Scope solutions with Heartland Secure. Please move to slide four.
We are working with multiple ISVs and dealers to take them Out-of-Scope, by offering a solution that implements EMV and to provide a flat form with NFC that supports Apple Pay and Android Pay today with added surprise, in my opinion, that this new hardware will be able to support whatever PayPal comes up with or iTunes or the next or the next payment types. Future-proof is too strong of a word in my view, but todayâs solution is a giant leap forward for security as well for empowering alternative payment solutions of the future. Letâs go to slide five.
Out-of-Scope is the new approach to reducing the exposure of merchants to the cyber terrorists that have compromised so many over the past years. Heartland is leading this technology for both SMB and large merchants. You may have seen the recent press release that our pcAmerica Software has gone live with our Out-of-Scope solution for an independent restaurant and also for an entrepreneurial clothing retailer. We are also proud that Au Bon Pain is now live with some of these stores with our Xpient software-based Out-of-Scope solution. We believe our solution is the best in class in the market today and that the runway in front of us is almost endless for this product for both SMB and Enterprise businesses. Letâs move to slide six.
To these merchants and the many thousands of others who will soon be using our Out-of-Scope solution, their exposure to breaches is greatly diminished and if they are breached there is simply no card data in the merchantâs system to be exposes. None at all. And this is a really big deal. Let me repeat, a merchant who uses Heartlandâs Out-of-Scope solution will never see a card number or any other card data and if breached, the merchant has no data of any value to the cyber terrorist and hence no fines or forensic costs or compromised customers.
Our Out-of-Scope solution counterfeits [ph] all of the card data and technology that connects directly to Heartlandâs data centers using our Heartland Secure product set. This product set encrypts all transactions, even chip card transactions which are otherwise transmitted in the clear and tokenizes all the card data for future reference. Letâs move to slide seven.
Heartland Secure means EMV and encryption and tokenization all wrapped into one system that transmits no personal identifiable information whatsoever. In a spirit of true coopetition we are beginning to certify our ISV competitors to these solutions. Digital Dining, one of the oldest in the premier restaurant POS system on the market today in many respects is the most recent ISV Out-of-Scope partner to certify with Heartland. Hundreds more will follow. The backlog is growing.
This is consistent with our expiry of working with our competitors for the betterment of our mutual customers. We are the truly open alternative for ISVs and dealers but most importantly for our end users the merchants. This solution not only solves the hardest part of a PCI compliance problem for the ISV and the dealer, it also encrypts the transactions and provides tokens so that no personally identifiable information data ever enters the POS system through the payment service. We believe this is the best in class EMV solution in the market today.
Like everyone in our business we canât get all of our applications certified fast enough and progress is too slow but we are on the way. To demonstrate this we are pleased to also announce that we have three cloud-based tablet POS providers certified in operation with us and we expect each of them to be working with our Out-of-Scope solution as well. These young companies are Shopkeep, emaginePOS and Springboard Retail.
We expect to be adding hundreds of additional ISVs through our partner list in the coming months and years. We simply have the best-in-class APIs and business model for the long-term growth and sustainability of their business. Letâs move to slide eight.
Of course, the POS dealers appreciate having this Out-of-Scope solution available to them as well. But like all of us responsible for creating and maintaining a sustainable business model, they are even more concerned about improving their revenues. No surprise.
Our response to this is the increased margin stack that we can provide to our dealer partners. As of last month we are pleased to have 2,114 dealers, ISVs and VARs who have referred business to Heartland. Most of these have recently joined us as part of the Dinerware and pcAmerica acquisitions. Of these 2,114 referral partners we have 331 trusted dealers who are under contract and another 410 dealerships in our pipeline. But our focus is not so much to add more referral partners but instead to improve the revenues of our partners and to improve the referrals to Heartland for payments, payroll and the many other services that we offer and will be offering our merchants.
But we are an open platform and smart operators like Digital Dining, Shopkeep, emaginePOS and Springboard Retail like the way we do business. They also believe in our Merchant Bill of Rights and they like partnering with us because we know that we will never have 100% of the features, functions and products that merchants want.
The opportunity and the challenge is that whatever we have today will be inadequate 12 months from today, and we know that. No one company can provide every service needed or wanted by every merchant. So we will do our best to be a fair and honest open system, open to our merchants, open to our trusted dealers and open to all of our Heartland Commerce partners. The POS has become more than a point of interaction for payments, of course. It is often the brain that collects the information to run the business and support all of the back office functions as well. This is the beauty of the Heartland Commerce business model.
With our newest acquisitions we know have even more capability to deliver valuable services through the POS to our customers. Payments is the primary service, and this is by far the most competitive service. But unlike our competitors we also offer other services that are supported through the POS and from which the dealer can earn revenue.
These other services include the traditional back office payroll, but also they now include labor management and employee scheduling, loyalty and gift programs, lending services, managed network services, data analytics, reservations, weight management, online ordering and customer origination services. Heartland Commerce is committed to providing these services with powerful APIs that integrate all of the logical workflows and reporting. This margin stack will help the dealer grow with a sustainable revenue stream from happy customers. Letâs move to slide nine.
Of course we believe that much of the margin currently earned by dealers from some ISOs is not sustainable. We believe there are good profits and there are bad profits. We donât believe bad profits are sustainable and therefore we stay away from them. But the exciting part of our business today is the opportunity that lies before us. We have the nationâs best sales organization hands-down, the best business model hands-down, the best Out-of-Scope solution and the largest margin stack for good profits available in the industry today.
We will not win over all of the ISVs or all of the dealers, but we will win over many of those who truly want to provide valuable services to their end users knowing that none of us can do everything for everybody.
And now Iâd like to turn the call back to Samir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Bob. Let me give you highlights of the results for the quarter. Heartland reported GAAP net income of $20.9 million or $0.50 per share and adjusted net income of $27.1 million or $0.72 per share for the second quarter 2015. Adjusted net income was up 29% while adjusted earnings per share were up 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. Adjusted results add back stock-based compensation and acquisition-related amortization expenses, which are markedly higher this year to our GAAP results.
This strong second quarter performance was driven by accelerating growth across a wide range of operating metrics. From a top-line perspective, total net revenue for the second quarter was $204 million, up 28% over the prior year. And on an organic basis, net revenue was up by 12.5% during the same period. In both cases, the revenue growth rates accelerated during the quarter compared to the first quarter of this year.
Card processing net revenue increased by 11% during the quarter. This was driven primarily by the SME processing volume growth which continues to be a key driver in this segment and accelerated to 16.5%, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Excluding the benefit of Amex Blue [ph], processing volume was up 12%. These results were once again driven by all-time record new installed margin which totaled $23.9 million in the quarter, up 14.6% from the second quarter of 2014. And also a strong sequential acceleration from the growth rate achieved in the first quarter.
And in June we surpassed $8 million in monthly new installed margin for the first time ever. Continuing strength in the same-store sales, which were up 3.4% also contributed to our record card processing volume. While same-store sales growth in the second quarter was down 1% sequentially from the first quarter, net volume attrition was only up 20 basis points, reflecting continuous and effective retention management.
The steady improvement in new installed margin and net volume attrition resulted in accelerated sequential card volume and net revenue growth. Net revenue for all the non-card processing segments grew collectively by 75%, including revenue contributed by acquisitions completed since the second quarter of last year. Excluding such contribution, non-card processing net revenue grew by nearly 16%. Let me briefly touch upon these business segments.
Heartland Payrollâs net revenue grew by 42% over last yearâs second quarter. Excluding the contribution from the acquisition of Payroll 1 net revenue grew by 15%, which was in line with our expectation. The SPA sales strategy that we accelerated over the last year is showing the double success we were expecting.
Campus Solutions net revenue grew by 171% in the second quarter. From an organic point of view, net revenue grew by 15%, which was in line with our expectations and represented noticeable compared to the first quarter of this year. TouchNet is performing as previously guided and cross-sell opportunities between the various campus products lines have begun to materialize, which will drive further growth in the future.
Heartlandâs School Solutions net revenue grew by 21% in the quarter. More importantly, the transactions revenue in this segment grew by 42% in the second quarter continuing the trend that began during the first quarter of this year, and reflecting the rapid growth in the number of parents who are adopting our electronic payment options.
Net revenue from Heartland Commerce, which is included in our Other segment, was 7.6 million in the quarter, which is in line with our expectation and includes the full quarter of Dinerware and pcAmerica already. Now let me give you a few highlights regarding our expenses.
Increases in both processing and servicing and general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by costs inherited with the various acquisitions, but also included added costs for Heartland Commerce integration as well as budgeted cost increases for marketing and corporate and IT security initiatives. Additionally in the second quarter we recognize an increase in sales compensation as a result of the steady outstanding performance of our sales organization as well as higher incentive compensation as a result of strong corporate and individual businesses segmentsâ financial performance.
I want to point out that second quarter 2015 total depreciation and other amortization expense excluding amortization of our core intangible increased by $2 million from a year ago. Bake out of depreciation and amortization expense by income statement line item is included in the statistical supplement.
Our adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 24%, up from 22% in the prior year and the prior second quarter. Compared to a year-ago our second quarter 2015 operating margin reflected significantly greater investment in marketing and corporate and IT security initiatives as well as sales and incentive compensation. Additionally the second quarter also included investments associated with Heartland Commerce which were new for this year. The margin for the second quarter of 2015 included the correction of a billing error on Heartland School Solutions.
Operating income on margins in both periods included losses from Leaf which were $1.2 million or $0.02 per share this quarter compared to $2.8 million or $0.05 per share in the previous second quarter - in the prior-year second quarter. As of June 30, losses from Leaf were concluded. From a cash flow perspective managementâs measure of operating cash flow for the quarter was $41.1 million up 25% from the second quarter of last year. Our total debt outstanding as of the end of the quarter was $553 million down $37 million sequentially and consistent with our current strategy to use cash flow to reduce borrowings. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.2 million and in line with our guidance for the year.
Let me wrap up with our guidance for 2015. For the full year we expect to deliver net revenue growth of 15% to 20% and should be between $795 million and $805 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.87. The guidance assumes after-tax share based compensation and acquisition related amortization expenses reduce earnings per share by $0.66 for the year and a tax rate of approximately 39%.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Bob for some closing remarks before opening up for questions. Bob?
Bob Carr
Thank you, Samir. Before concluding our remarks Iâm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share payable September 15, 2015, to stockholders of record on August 25. And once again I would like to thank all the great Heartland team members who are driving these powerful and positive results. Finally, Iâd like to thank all of our stakeholders for giving the Heartland team the opportunity to achieve a full 10 years of success as a publicly traded company.
Next Tuesday, August 11, many of our team leaders will be at the New York Stock Exchange and we will once again have the honor of ringing the opening bell, this time in celebration of our first 10 years as a leader in American business.
And now, Andrew, weâre ready to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Samir Zabaneh
Good morning.
Andrew Jeffrey
Thank you for taking the question. Iâm just wondering if you can parse out or quantify the investments in Heartland Commerce that we see running through the payment processing line and maybe talk a little bit about how long itâs going to take you to scale those initiatives. Clearly, I think, the differentiation youâre bringing to the market is important and starting to show up in the [ph] NMI and revenue growth rate. But Iâm wondering at what point do we start to get some operating leverage?
Samir Zabaneh
So let me start with giving you some perspective on the actual numbers. We do not expect Heartland Commerce this year to be - to contribute to the operating income but we do expect that beginning next year, especially as we start seeing more payments revenue being driven at the point of sale we should start expecting an acceleration of revenue, on top of the softer revenue that weâre right now seeing. That is ongoing and in line with our expectations.
We should begin to see a noticeable margin expansion coming from that segment, but that wonât happen until, realistically speaking, Andrew, until the beginning of next year. We might see something towards the end of this year but for the full year it will not be contributing any margin.
And the investment that we are making with respect to Heartland Commerce, that is really just in line with, as we discussed before standardizing that product road map and ensuring that all of the functions and features that - that part of the Heartland Commerce will benefit from each other and also of course ensuring that the Out-of-Scope solution is something that is present and available for each of these segments.
Andrew Jeffrey
Okay. Thatâs helpful. Thank you. And just qualitatively, can you talk a little bit about how receptive the dealers have been? Bob, you mentioned that one of the things that has driven perhaps dealers into the arms of the competition has simply been higher residuals. How do you get the sense or how would you convey the receptivity of the Heartland Commerce software and how itâs resonating with dealers out there?
Bob Carr
Yeah. Andrew, thatâs a great question. The answer is that some of the dealers really love our model and some of them really donât like it at all. We have signed up, for example, 35% of the Dinerware dealers to become trusted dealers for Heartland. We think thatâs really significant and positive.
The dealers are a different type, a dealer isnât one of those words that means whatever you want it to mean. There are dealers who are really - theyâre really ISOs who are - who call themselves dealers. They donât really provide local service for the hardware of any of those kinds of services, theyâre in the business for payment processing revenue only and thatâs a fact of life. And those people are not going to become our partners probably because they have control over the way the merchants are billed and many of them use tools that are not available to our sales people or to our dealers. We just donât allow pricing thatâs not properly disclosed or even in violation of the accepted trade practices which are common among many, many, not all but many.
So weâre not going to get everybody, we know that for sure but the dealer who has a local business, theyâve got trucks running around servicing and installing, they have training programs for their dealers, those are the people that want to do business with us and the improved margin stack we believe is going to more than make up for the revenue that theyâre not going to get from us with fees that we think are bad profits.
So weâll see, so far itâs going better than I expected frankly. And I think itâs going to work out really, really well because we do have an awful to offer a true dealer if theyâre looking at their business from the long haul. Weâre not forcing them by the way. Weâre not forcing anybody to only do business with us, and weâre not - but weâre all - we are not allowing them to continue to add customers that have - in a way that violates the Merchant Bill of Rights.
Samir Zabaneh
And the one, maybe, point with respect to the money that will make, Andrew, that the dealers - and thatâs something we did not give a lot of highlight on, that the margins available to them just from the software itself is quite healthy. So they would have to do the math and decide whether they want to access that type of margins they would get from the software side. Whether it is a sub-based model which weâre working through or whether itâs a perpetual license. But they do make a significant amount of margin from the software that we make available to them.
Operator
The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jeff Chen
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Jeff Chen in for Jim. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on how Payrollâs doing. It grew quite nicely but a bit of a downtick in margin. Can you just walk through some of the trends youâre seeing? Is that just you building out increased selling costs?
Samir Zabaneh
So thank you for that question. Yes, Payroll is growing in line with our expectation. The margins have declined partly this continued consolidation that we have across the platform, the purchases from Payroll 1. We are spending money on the integration between the Payroll 1 and the core Heartland Payroll. And overall cost of acquisitions, as you could see, when you look at the head count of total sales we have dramatically increased the number of SPAs that we have in Payroll. So we should expect an even further acceleration of revenue. But to do that there was a little bit cost up front that we are investing in campaigns to reflect those spots.
Jeff Chen
But I do...
Bob Carr
And I...
Samir Zabaneh
When you look at Payroll, sorry Bob, when you look at Payroll the fundamentals of the Payroll business our added cost, our added margin costs of an additional Payroll customer, our additional Payroll processing, is much lower than the core Payroll business. So you should begin to see margin expansion. But we need to get to the scale that we would need to get there, and I do believe that weâre starting to get there. Go ahead, Bob.
Bob Carr
And Iâd just like to emphasize the point that Samir made. We have added a lot of SPAs and there is a period where they have to get - be acclimated to us and we really are trying to be very ready for the fourth quarter selling season for Payroll, and we think weâre well positioned to do that. And weâre sort of paying the price in terms of operating margin here in the middle of the year in order to get the gain that weâre expecting in the fourth quarter.
Operator
The next question comes from [ph] Steven Qua of KBW. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good quarter, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just have a question around your relationships with the POS dealers like Shopkeep. How does the economics work in those instances?
Bob Carr
Well, just generally, Shopkeep is very interested in adding more customers, SaaS customers. They have some very nice functionality in the retail space that we do not have with a tablet-based platform. So our salespeople are referring business to Shopkeep for those services. We derive the payments revenue, and if Shopkeep refers a payroll client to us or a payments client to us or other, we pay them a referral fee, and they pay a referral fee if we refer to them. So everybody wins and the customer at the end of the day has what they want.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. And then as we look out into the future and as these relationships grow, should we expect some modest compression around the SMB revenue yield then as a result of this?
Bob Carr
I donât think so, frankly, because the monies that weâre paying out - the good thing about a real dealer that really does the local servicing and local installations, they do take workload off of our servicing center. And for example, the dealer will take the first call from the merchant if thereâs an issue instead of them calling Heartland. And so we believe we have reduced servicing costs as a result of that.
And the referral fee basically is part of the sales commission. We believe a sales commission has different components, and we want to pay the right person for the component where they have the value. And so itâs not inconsistent with our model at all, and I donât think weâll see margin compression with that segment of the business.
Operator
The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Koning
Yeah, hey guys, great job. And I guess first, just on the OptBlue contribution, you talked about how much it contributed to volumes. Iâm wondering maybe if you can say how much it contributed to revenue and then how it kind of plays out. Does it fully anniversary in Q3, or is that program actually still growing so you donât get a total cliff kind of that growth going away in Q3? Maybe if you can just talk through how thatâs going to work?
Samir Zabaneh
Okay. Thanks. Thanks, David. The OptBlue program as we said before there are four phases of the OptBlue and right now in the - we are I guess in the three phases. The one that has contributed the most in terms of upside is the phase three as we talked about before and, yes, that will anniversary in the Q4 of this year. And then beyond that we will continue to work on - on phase two which is enabling customers to accept Amex and phase four is the one that is still out there and can be unlocked at some time in the future but is not - thatâs not really built in our guidance. And phase four will contribute more to the actual revenue. But in terms of the biggest increase that we have seen was really related to the conversions that we talked about before and that will anniversary at the end of this year.
Dave Koning
Is there a way to isolate - so if youâve been growing payments revenue now by what 11%, 12% and you should get another good quarter as you mentioned it sounds like? But has that been 5% of it? Like by Q4 do we go back down to 5%, 6%, 7% growth in payments?
Samir Zabaneh
If you look at our total card processing revenue that was around 11%, NWS [ph] has been flat so you can see - you could quickly calculate where the growth came from the SME side. And I would say if I were to guess what percentage would that be, I think that would be from OptBlue probably 3%. So your normal revenue increase beyond that if take away the phase two contribution would be, at least for the numbers today will be in the high single digits which is higher than what we had - what we had guided for and that is a good trend.
And this is really driven by volume, weâve been increasing our volume tremendously, same-store sales is helping. But really if you focus on the installed margin, continuous increase in installed margin would continue to drive volume on areas as I mentioned earlier our retention management is showing results that actually were noticeable this quarter. So itâs really all about volume growth, our yield is in line with what we expected. The size mix and the portfolio continue that same trend but to a lesser degree so we didnât see any yield pressure similar to what we have seen recently.
Bob Carr
And if I could only just add, itâs important to remember that Heartland sales force has always been highly effective at selling the Amex product so the old OnePoint program was something that was contributing to our results before so that compared to some others that are out there that are now selling, trying to sell Amex more aggressively, our sales force is doing it aggressively today but did it aggressively before, and we make good economics on the OptBlue program, I mean on the OnePoint program, so the Delta is not perhaps as great for us as for some other people.

The next question comes from Tom McCrohan of CLFA. Please go ahead.
Tom McCrohan
All right. Thanks, guys, and great quarter. I had a question on revenue guidance. And given the sustainability it seems for OptBlue in the back half, and looking at the past 10 years with the exception of 2011, your back-half revenues have always been greater than you first half. So just annualizing current run rates, you come in at kind of mid-point in your guidance, so Iâm wondering what would result in your back-half revenues being below what the current run rate would be or suggest from this quarter to get you toward the bottom of your guidance.
Samir Zabaneh
Weâre not expecting anything to be below in the back half of the year. The only one would be in Q4. We will have a little bit of a headwind because last quarter, in Q4 of last year, we had doubled the upside from the conversion of phase three of OptBlue whereas this in Q4, we will not have that. But other than that, weâre not expecting any decline in any of the businesses.
Tom McCrohan
Okay. And some of these newer tablet point-of-sale partners, do they have a dealer network today, or is this a product that they sell and youâve just certified them on Heartland Secure, and you have some sort of referral agreement on the payment processing side?
Bob Carr
Yeah. Tom, thatâs a good question. I think the dealers are trying to figure out, or not the dealers but the tablet-based ISVs are trying to figure out distribution, and itâs a big problem for them. I think thatâs why many of them are coming to us. Iâd say that most of them are trying to sell directly. The whole idea of being able to do digital marketing campaigns and to sell with a very low cost of sale is the heart of the model, and with the SAS models that are out there, most of them, the revenue is just not really significant enough to share it with a dealer unless itâs combined with other services, and we have the most other services to offer. So I think the short answer is that they primarily do not have dealers and are trying to figure out what to do and weâre a nice alternative for them.

The next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham. Please go ahead.
David Hochstim
Hey. Just two quick questions. One, could you just give us an update on same store sales? It seems like they came in a little better this quarter than maybe youâd expected, and is there any trend noticeable over the course of the quarter or through July? And then just wondered, expanding on the last question, about these new terminal providers, how much an impediment to their sales is getting certification? And so youâre - how much of a benefit is your Out-of-Scope solution to getting them increasing sales quickly?
Samir Zabaneh
So let me answer just the same store sales. You are correct and I think maybe that will point back to Tomâs question earlier in terms of what we expect for the second half the year. We - yes, we had exceptional same store sales in Q1, we had really good same store sales in Q2. Weâll still assume for the rest of the year, we initially guided 2% to 3%, weâre expecting right now, given half - we already passed half of the year that weâll be at 3% for the rest of the year, so if there is any potential softness, and there isnât anything that would lead us to believe that there is a softness but from a guidance point of view weâre still guiding to the 3%, even though the first half of the year was actually better.
In terms of revenue that weâre getting right now from an Out-of-Scope solution, clearly this product and this capability is very important for us and really important to our customers, and we - and to our dealers. We do expect to see acceleration beyond what we have guided in the revenue coming from further implementation of this further. But I canât give you right now any numerical guidance to what revenue weâll get out of that software.
Bob Carr
And to elaborate a little bit, the EMV implementation for POS systems is still very early innings, a little bit of a mess, the complexities of the U.S. system, the number of players, the number of certifications is a real problem, and yes, we do see one of the benefits. Of course a key one is just getting out of PCI scope, but also a more straight-line ability to offer both EMV and NFC in a way that maintains high levels of security is going to be an important leading point.
But the last point I make is a lot of POS merchants who do use POS, for example restaurants, really are not very focused on or particularly concerned by the liability shift that occurs October - in October. There isnât a lot of counterfeit card usage at restaurants and such. So itâs way thatâs building, Iâd say for multiple reasons itâs building a little more slowly in the POS world than in some other implementations, either at large merchants or in the standalone terminal world.
David Hochstim
Thanks. And just as a follow-up, did you see any change in same-store sales trends in July relative to Q2?
Samir Zabaneh
No. They should be - they still seem to be strong but - and weâre happy where they are so far.

The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
`
Brett Huff
Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.
Samir Zabaneh
Sure.
Brett Huff
Itâs a pretty broad question and just trying to understand how you guys see the different opportunities for growth and margin opportunity between the various initiatives youâve got going on, I know thereâs several of them whether itâs commerce, payroll, school solutions, et cetera. Can you just kind of remind us how you rank those opportunities and then how your investment or your sort of investment strategy behind those over in the next year or so?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. So maybe I will start that and Bob feel free to add. We rank them obviously based on strategic importance. We have a corporate strategy and all of the investments that are in line with that strategy on top of those that are - must be required for compliance and for compliance reasons, those definitely come first. But we have a strategy and we rank all of our investment based on strategic - strategic relevance and basically the business cases for them.
We have a lot on the go right now and thatâs why and I have said before that weâre going through a period of heavy investments right now. And those - the velocity of the investments and the spend that you see today, we donât expect that to be - to continue in the future. So from an overall margin perspective you should start seeing I guess lesser increases in expenses as you would see increases in our revenue. So the conversion of increased revenue will begin to be noticed in the operating income and adjusted operating income line beginning of next year.
So in terms of ranking, this is the ranking that we go through. As, Bob, also mentioned weâre going through that EMV conversion right now so any opportunity we see today that we can take advantage of that change in the market, that doesnât have to happen often, of course we need to be ready for that. So...
Bob Carr
Let me add - let me add to - I think there are so many opportunities for growth. And your question is a really good one and Iâm going to give you a broad answer just like you asked for the broad question. Our greatest opportunity for growth is to have more salespeople and more local representation by dealers to sell our growing set of products. You could have argued that, hey, you can only have a thousand sales people if youâre a payments company. But when you add payroll in there and you add all these other services that POS allows us deliver in real-time and convert batch systems to real-time systems, itâs really a matter of getting out to the millions of businesses to present the product.
There seems to be a lot of thinking that the Internet is the wave of the future and that sales organizations are obsolete. We think that thatâs not true. We think there is a good room for local representation and local dealerships, and with our growing array of products, we can handle more and more salespeople. We want our salespeople to make a good living being able to sell in their local area and within their networks. And so we think that is the number-one opportunity, thus create an environment and a set of products that we can grow the sales organization from 1,200 to 1,500 to 2,000 and we can sustain that because of the revenue streams available from the multitude of products.
And having said that, Heartland Commerce seems to be the main lever that weâre investing in, but school solutions and campus and payroll are all great opportunities as well. So itâs a great time to be in this business.
Brett Huff
Great. Thatâs all I needed. Thank you.

The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Smitti Srethapramote
Thank you. Just a follow-up question on the margins. Can you help us sort of segregate what percent of the margin decline in payments came from the increase in investments in Commerce, higher sales commissions, investments in security in Q2?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure. Most of the - I would say most of the increases that I talked about happened to be in the payments side. Auto folks [ph] solution is a - we consider it part of the payments. Security is really part of the payments, but they will definitely help drive growth in the Heartland Commerce. So from a margin perspective, you would see the biggest rates coming on the card processing side, as you can see in our supplemental information but some of that [indiscernible] other businesses.
Smitti Srethapramote
Okay. And then once Heartland Commerce is fully up and running, can you talk about in which potential segments would you see an accelerated growth in same-store sales?
Samir Zabaneh
Well same-store sales across the board have been quite good at least from given our portfolio mix has been on the restaurant side. And Heartland Commerce is really focused broadly on the restaurant and on the retail side. Retailers also have had good same-store sales so I would expect if we have the same environment as we have today, we would expect same-store sales within the Heartland Commerce to be in line - to be in line with what we see broadly in the portfolio. But the acceleration in revenue that will come from Heartland Commerce as, Bob, mentioned all of the additional products and services that we will drive for these customers.
Plus also the one - I mean another exciting thing about Heartland Commerce is that we will finally get to the point where we have a scorecard where we can see how many of customers have more than one product. We have the point-of-sale product with our customers and we add the payment story to the payrolls. The retention that you would have with these customers would be much, much stronger and I will believe the overall margins would be much stronger.

The next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal
So I have a question on the margin stack and pricing, I mean I know itâs early days. Will you guys have control over how your dealer prices these services? Do you expect to see a lot of variability in the end market pricing just because youâre going to kind of push these at a wholesale rate that folks will mark up in different ways or how do you see all that sort of playing out?
Bob Carr
Well we have a long, a long serving commission model that works for us very well and that is giving the salesperson control over the pricing within a range. We have a minimum and a maximum that they can charge and they must - all the charges, different kinds of charges must be fully disclosed. So we donât think itâs going to be a whole lot different going forward with our dealers involved. They will have a lot to say about the pricing but they have to do it within our rules.
Ramsey El-Assal
Okay. One super quick follow-up, are you seeing any incremental EMV adoption in the SME market? Just trying to track how EMV is kind of filtering from the larger merchants, they seem a little more on top of it than in the small market.
Bob Carr
Yeah. Yeah. Itâs a great question. As, Bob Baldwin, said earlier or referred to it, weâre not getting - our doors arenât getting knocked down by merchants wanting EMV. Some of them absolutely do want to have it. The restaurants in particular paying at the table and EMV are not working out, workable yet, with the existing technology. Lots of people working on that.
But the ISVs definitely want Out-of-Scope because of the PCI issues and being able to offer to EMV. There is a certain set of merchants that want to have the EMV, and theyâre the ones that weâre really trying to handle right now. But as they - as the merchants start understanding - merchants basically donât understand that they have no idea how many counterfeit cards are used at their location. So I hear all the time, but we donât have a big chargeback problem or a fraud problem. Well, actually, they donât even know. Thereâs no way for them to know. But they will find out once they - if they donât have EMV theyâll find out how many counterfeit cards are used at their place of business.
So - and that I think will create the wave thatâs coming a lot quicker. The big merchants all get it and there thatâs where the focus is as you suggest.
Bob Baldwin
The exposure and that learning process curve will be very steep for people like [ph] Suveal Electronics, any kind of clothing or accessory retailer, thatâs where the goods are most fenceable and so thatâs where the bad guys will use the counterfeit cards most aggressively. As Bob said, they donât know right now. The issuers are absorbing that, those losses. All of a sudden those are going to come winging back and them and so November is going to be - when the statements for October hit thereâs going to be a big surprise by certain categories. Others like restaurants itâs unlikely to be a dramatic impact.

The next question comes from Jason Delue of Piper Jaffray.
Eric Robinson
Hey, guys, itâs actually Eric Robinson on for Jason. Thanks for taking my question here. Just kind of curious on the relationship manager growth quarter-over-quarter. Could you kind of touch a little more on that and where the relationship managers are coming from? Is there any - are they coming maybe from any of the ISOs or anything like that?
Bob Carr
Thereâs really no change in that. We - our division managers recruit. We have a recruiting team and weâre just - weâre slowly growing our sales organization, getting more and more producers, more and more all-star producers. So I wouldnât say thereâs any change in the trend there.
Bob Baldwin
And generally the history has been that not a lot of people from other ISOs, itâs a lot of entrepreneurs, people who are restaurateurs who want to move on. Itâs a whole range, but I think while hiring continues to be at highest levels weâve ever had. I feel very good about the candidates weâre getting, and we are still working hard on helping those sales people make it through that very tough year in a commission environment to the extent that we can succeed at that, that will help our growth as well.
Operator
And the last question will come from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chris Brendler
Hey, thanks so much for taking my question. Great results. I just want to talk briefly, Samir, about six months ago when you announced the restructuring on commerce and shutting down Leaf, it seemed like this would be kind of a re-building year. And I want to get your sense just from you and how things have progressed throughout the year. Has it really been the legacy payment process business thatâs had a great year or is it the investments youâre making have come in better than expected? Just help us think about the scorecard so far this year on whatâs driving such strong growth.
And then a follow-up would be is any of that related to EMV to the extent that small merchants are behind the EMV curve? Is the outlook for 2016 all that much better as they really try to upgrade these terminals? Thanks.
Samir Zabaneh
Okay. Great. Excellent question. I would say when you look at the overall score card, I am really happy with the results that we see so far, especially given - I think they have exceeded what we expected earlier in the year or six months ago. If you look at the card processing, we continue to increase our installed margin. I am excited about our retention management.
Generally speaking, we have lower addition than the industry, but even that weâre actually making it smaller and smaller. And the installed margins when you break, when you break the overall volume that we have on the cards, and even take away the same storage sales, the amount of volume that we received from new customer was in excess of 20%. And that to me is an excellent accomplishment, and a testament of how well the sales team is doing.
One of the key leading indicators that I look at is how many sales people we have, and we add the productivity level. As well, Bob also mentioned earlier, we feel happy about the acceleration we have in terms of adding more sales people. So to the extent that we could maintain the productivity level, we expect the sales [ph] margin to continue to grow.
On the Payroll side we had really good, we had really good revenue growth organically. Sort of in line with what we expected, but also the number of exposure we have has increased a lot, and that was somewhat of a challenge we had in the past. So we expect to benefit from that on the Payroll side. And Payroll 1 turned out to be a really good addition that we have for the portfolio.
School Solutions, the number of - the growth in the number of transactions is really a proof of the whole thesis we had initially of investing in technology platforms that will drive significant amounts of payments in the future. That is a great margin business and we expect to continue to see. And we had mentioned before that the number of active participants in the program is increasing by over 20%, and that continues to be the trend.
And finally, I think on the campus side, weâre getting to see cross-sale opportunities between the different campus lives, and that is exciting and should be great in the future. We had all of these items on our scorecards, and I feel quite happy about that. Heartland Commerce is still being built out, but weâve been able to build three other businesses very successfully, and that feels quite, Iâm just as excited about the potential of where Heartland Commerce is.
On the integration on the technology side, we continue to go through that, and that is in line with what we expected on the scorecard. So this is a very long answer, but I think that is really what youâre looking for in terms of overall conclusion of the scorecard.
