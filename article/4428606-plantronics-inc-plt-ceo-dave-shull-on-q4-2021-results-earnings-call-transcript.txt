Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Poly Q4 fiscal year 2021 conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Iburg. Please go ahead.
Mike Iburg
Welcome to Poly's financial results conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. My name is Mike Iburg, Head of Investor Relations. And joining me today are Dave Shull, Poly President and CEO and Chuck Boynton, Executive Vice President and CFO.
The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and today's press release and earnings presentation.
You should also refer to the materials we provide today for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and previously reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. All of our earnings materials are posted on our Investor Relations website at investor.poly.com.
With that, I would now turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Shull
Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us from wherever you work. With vaccinations and travel on the rise, today I am calling in from our Denver office while Chuck is in our Santa Cruz office. Poly had another strong quarter reflected by the numbers.
Chuck will talk in more detail about our financial results but we saw non-GAAP revenues of $478 million and adjusted EBITDA of $86 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17% and 44%, respectively, driven primarily by strong video and headset sales. I want to call out that this was the biggest video quarter in the company's history, a terrific affirmation of the rise of video overall, which we see as a long term tailwind post-COVID. Despite pandemic-related supply chain pressures and freight cost increases, we continue to protect our gross margins, which were 48.4% for the quarter. We generated $74 million in operating cash flow, refinanced our outstanding bonds and paid down our term loan.
On the product side, in February, we announced our new Studio P Series, a line of personal video conferencing gear designed for the remote worker and supported by our unmatched software and services platform, Poly Lens. We also reached an incredible milestone this quarter shipping our 30 millionth IP phone as we are seeing remarkably strong demand for phones across Zoom Phone, RingCentral and others. And just a few days ago, we launched Voyager Focus 2, a Bluetooth headset with advanced noise cancellation and our unique Acoustic Fence technology delivering extraordinary sound and wear all-day comfort. This kind of performance, both financially and operationally, defines Poly's opportunity going forward. Specifically, it speaks to both the transformation of our market and the transformation of our business.
When I joined Poly, I was clear about the challenges the company faced. I framed the company accurately as a turnaround. We brought in excellent new leaders like our head of supply chain Grant Hoffman whose arrival has already had a huge impact. We also enabled terrific executives already here like Carl Wiese, our Chief Revenue Officer, who is rapidly rebuilding our channel reputation and Chuck, who has reduced and refinanced our debt. So while we are not yet at full sail, it's safe to say that the ship has turned.
Everyone at Poly has worked hard to get it to the point where I can say today on an earnings call, we are no longer a turnaround. You won't hear me use that word again. Today, Poly is about transformation of our market and of our business. The market is different because the way we work has changed. Everyday, there is more evidence and momentum of a permanent shift to a highly distributed workforce and hybrid connectivity across our colleagues, our partners and our customers.
A recent survey of 164 commercial landlords who own and control 7.1 billion square feet of commercial real estate assets across the United States showed that 82% expect a hybrid work model going forward, where employees work from the office just three days a week. And a recent IDC study on digital work transformation show that 42% of organizations are focused on connecting people seamlessly, regardless of location, situation or context.
We have said it before and will saying it, work is no longer a place. It's what you do and how you do it. That mean the world's workforce doesn't need tools for a place. They need gear that connects them seamlessly to other people to be productive, to sell, provide counsel, ask questions, solve problems, innovate and educate. Poly makes that gear. Products that are tools, not toys. And more importantly, we have the services, support and technology to make sure that they work right all the time.
So now, let's talk about Poly's own transformation, which we will expand on our upcoming Investor Day. We are organizing our business around one key idea, enterprise communication is no longer about individual devices. Instead, it is about offering comprehensive business infrastructure, the software and services to connect people, spaces and technology to create the future of work. This is the catalyst for a powerful and audacious future for Poly.
In the past, even recently, Poly often competed just on the basis of camera and audio quality, maybe also on AI integration with the hardware. But the fact is that our customers are facing a deeper and wider set of challenges as they plan for the post-COVID world. The IT leaders are worried about compatibility, data analytics, security, digital workflow management, reliability and support, both in the cloud and on-premises. Top HR leaders and CEOs are also worried about equality in meetings for those in the room and those not. Government, healthcare providers and the world's biggest banks, all need reliable and secure communications and each have a set of specific requirements that must be met to ensure an optimal experience.
Across the board, our customers want comprehensive business solutions to enable work-at-home, work-in-the-office three days a week, work in store meeting and work in lengthy brainstorming sessions. Poly's future lies in getting as close as possible to our customers and working alongside them to create a complete infrastructure for the future of work. Our solution must be easy to apply and despite the complexity of the underlying infrastructure must operate reliably, seamlessly and invisibly all the time.
We have a team of business leaders in place who recognize this and who are frankly working harder than hell to outthink and outwork our competitors because we are not just content to capture incremental comm spend at our clients. Communications is bigger, the technology infrastructure supporting it is bigger and we are looking to capture a bigger share of our customer's total IT spend. If we do this, we will grow faster than our already expanding markets and we will create new markets that we will claim as our own.
Before we turn to Chuck for the numbers, I want to take a moment to speak to supply chain. Just a year ago, people and businesses alike were wondering whether there would be enough demand to survive, let alone grow. Recently, CEOs of every major public company, Apple, Cisco, GM, Samsung, to name just a few, are talking about supply chain pressures created by excess demand, especially for semiconductors, memory and other electronic components. Poly is not immune and we are facing these same pressures.
Long term, that speaks to the strength of our opportunity. Short term, it's an operating pressure we have to manage. We can't be sure how long this tightness will last and it changes daily. So we are focused on operational improvements that will allow us to deliver the best possible customer experience. I want to underscore a far more important point about supply chain however. Components are just one part and a temporary part of Poly's supply chain story.
Last quarter, I highlighted that our supply chain was our number one area of operational focus and we have brought Grant Hoffman onboard as our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. Since then, Grant and his team have been working nonstop to audit Poly's supply chain end-to-end from the conceptual stages of a product's design to its final arrival on a customer's desk. We have developed and delivered a detailed strategy to upgrade and optimize every aspect of it and is in the process of executing plans that will generate tens of millions of dollars in savings over time.
Given our ambitions to grow, we need to ensure Poly's got the infrastructure to do it. Grant will be presenting at Investor Day and I encourage you to join us in this event. I think you all agree that the experience and expertise he brings the Poly will serve our company, our customers and our shareholders well.
In just a few days, on May 18, we will celebrate our 60th anniversary as a company. But given the audacious plans for future, given the transformational opportunities we see in front of us, there is one more change we are making that you should know about, our ticker. Effective May 24, our new ticker will be POLY, Poly. And as much as I have enjoyed the transition to remote work, I have to say that's one business event I am thrilled to attend in person, ringing in the NYSE closing bell on the 24th to celebrate our history, our accomplishments and most importantly the future ahead. I was last in New York City on March 10, 2020. So to return safely and fully vaccinated with a brighter future ahead will truly be a celebration.
Let me now turn things over to Chuck who will provide a more detailed view of our financial performance. Chuck?
Chuck Boynton
Thanks Dave. As Dave mentioned, it was another strong quarter driven by remote work and video collaboration. And following last quarter's record professional headset revenue, this quarter set a new all-time record for video revenue.
Non-GAAP revenue was $478 million, 17% increase from the prior year, driven primarily by video and professional headsets which were up 125% and 20% respectively. And as expected, our voice sales declined 33% year-over-year or relatively flat sequentially. Services revenue remained stable at $67 million. Gross margins declined 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by air freight and product mix. Operating expenses were flat year-over-year at $155 million and operating income of $76 million was up 58%.
For the full fiscal year of 2021, total revenue increased 1% with video and professional headsets up 50% and 20% respectively. This was offset by voice and services which declined 41% and 9% for the year. Lastly, our consumer business, which we largely exited a year ago, was down nearly 80%. If your remove consumer, our revenue was up 6% and excluding services, total product revenue was up 9% in fiscal 2021. Gross margins for the full year declined 240 basis points, but that decline was more than offset by reduced operating expenses resulting in an 80 basis point improvement in operating margins for fiscal 2021. Incremental freight impacted gross margins by approximately 200 basis points.
The demand environment for Poly products remain strong. Our next gen video solutions continue to gain traction with sell-through increasing over 700% year-over-year. These newer video products now represent approximately two-thirds of our video revenue and 90% of our unit shipment. Backlog remains elevated and is shifting to video and voice as enterprise customers prepare to return to the office. Lastly, channel inventory was roughly flat to the prior quarter.
Turning to cash. Operating cash flow was quite strong at $74 million for the quarter, yielding approximately $150 million for the year. We ended our year with $217 million of cash and short term investments after retiring $100 million of the term loan in the quarter. In February, we refinanced our 5.5% bonds due in 2023 with a 4.75% bond due in 2029. This transaction not only reduces our interest expense going forward, but also removed a near term debt maturity. Please note that we did not pay off the 2023 bond in our fiscal Q4. Rather than save money and avoid the early redemption fees, the cash was held in escrow and is reflected as restricted cash on our balance sheet. Both the bond and the restricted cash will come off our balance sheet in fiscal Q1.
Turning to guidance. As you likely saw in our earnings press release, the global semiconductor chip shortage is impacting our supply chain and the situation remains fluid. As mentioned earlier, end market demand for video and professional headsets remains strong and voice demand is recovering. Absent supply shortages, we believe demand would support sequential revenue growth off the March quarter. However, based on our current supply and expected availability of specific components, we expect to deliver financial results for fiscal Q1 within the following ranges.
GAAP revenue, $410 million to $430 million. Adjusted EBITDA $50 million to $60 million. Earnings per share, $0.35-$0.55. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14% to 16% and the shares outstanding should be approximately 44 million. Lastly, regarding our Q1 gross margins. Spot pricing for components and incremental logistics costs associated with the global chip shortage will impact gross margins by as much as several hundred basis points in the quarter.
Before I turn the call over to the operator to take questions, let me echo Dave's point about where we are as a business. In a difficult operating environment, we set out to improve every aspect of our business. We strengthened our balance sheet which means we improved our financial flexibility. We improved our leadership team and launched to new products and services. Similar to last year, we have a new set of challenges ahead of us with constrained component supply. However, our balance sheet is strong. We have significant demand in healthy and growing markets and we look forward to the future.
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani
Thank you very much for taking my question. I have two, I guess. First, I am going to start off with the March quarter guidance. Help me out there but if I look sequentially, your sales are down 12%. I think EBITDA is down 26% and the midpoint of EPS guide, I think the EPS guide is down 60%. So maybe just touch on what is driving that outsized EPS deleverage on a sequential basis? And it's something on the operating line or below the operating line, that would be really helpful?
Chuck Boynton
Certainly, Amit. Thank you for the question. So effectively, what you are seeing is revenue being impacted by the chip shortage. And as we said in the prepared remarks, absent the chip shortage, we would expect a sequential growth. Now there is an impact on the gross margin line due to freight and spot market purchases and that flows to the gross margin line and we mentioned up to several hundred basis point impact on gross margins.
We do expect our operating expenses to come in lower than they were sequentially, so we will get some additional leverage in the OpEx line. That effectively is driving, mitigating and helping on the EBITDA line. Now in the past quarter, we had a tax benefit and in Q1 we expect to then have tax expense which is impacting EPS. And so that's effectively what you are seeing relative to EBITDA to the EPS translation.
Amit Daryanani
Got it. That was really helpful. And then you said there's gross margin headwind of several hundred basis points. Do you think March quarter would be the peak from a gross margin headwind perspective? Or can you improve gross margin, I guess and go beyond the quarter, beyond basically Q1, June quarter, for the full year?
Chuck Boynton
Amit, we are very bullish on gross margin improvement over time. I still think that this gross margin ratio or line for the company when we normalize is in the low-50s, 50% to 55%. We are seeing really great progress with Grant and the work he is doing on material cost reduction. The supply chain freight issues are still plaguing us. And as we move freight back to the water, as air freight charges start to subside following, quite frankly, consumer air travel or commercial air travel, those will benefit the gross margin line and we should be back in the range where we were historically in the low-50s.
Amit Daryanani
Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just a question, second question I had is, you have been averaging 20% topline growth in the back half of your fiscal year. So maybe you can help us as to how to understand, what should the long term vector look like, be that in fiscal 2021 or beyond? And very specifically, how do you think video as a segment would stack up from a growth basis for the fiscal year?
Dave Shull
Chuck, maybe I will take that. I remain very bullish. We are not going to provide specific guidance today. I think we will provide a little bit more color in terms of the annual growth rates at the Investor Day in a week or so. But I think what's probably the most instructive metric on video is the next generation video portfolio growing more than 700% year-over-year. And so we are seeing tremendous demand.
The pipeline is very strong. And I think even with a few delays in certain geographies tied to slower vaccinations than people have hoped, I think for several quarters to come, we are going to see pretty massive demand on the video side. And so to me, that's tremendously bullish. We want to make sure that we are optimized and ready from an operating point of view to fully capitalize on that.
The one other thing I would add to Chuck's comments on gross margin is, another reason why we are very positive, I guess I should say, that kind of the low-50s is the appropriate range is all the work that the supply chain team is doing with regard to design to value. And so the tens of millions of dollars of savings that I mentioned in terms of targets here on the gross profit side are tied to freight issues that Chuck mentioned but also a lot of design efforts going our way collaboratively between our suppliers and our engineering team.
Amit Daryanani
Understood. Thank you very much for the clarity.
Mike Iburg
Thanks Amit. Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Paul Silverstein
Thank you for taking the questions. I know it's fluid and so early but with vaccination increasing across the globe, different economies, different regions, different places are going through a vaccination process. Any insight you gain in terms of the impact, whether the U.S. reopening, Germany reopening, U.K. reopening. Again, I recognize different places are at different points. But one would think that macro recovery has certain implications for you and others. Any insight you gain in terms of how that translates to revenue, for better or worse?
Dave Shull
Yes. I think it depends a lot by category. So let's just talk a little bit specifically category by category. So headsets are up roughly 60% year over year Q4-over-Q4. We are seeing a significant shift in mix. So we are seeing fewer people buying the wired headsets and more people shifting to Bluetooth because they are settling in and saying this is going to be a long term trend where 35%, 40% of the workforce is going to be in the office some days and at homes some days. It's actually driving sort of the uptick from a Bluetooth point of view.
On the video side, there's tremendous demand as people are looking at building out the conference rooms. I think though we are seeing a shift away from sort of the concept of a whole room, right. Every room becomes more of a huddle room in the sense that it requires video. And so we look at the 90%-plus of conference rooms that need to be built up from a video point of view, there is pretty substantial demand.
The pipeline is very strong. The precise execution of that pipeline really varies by geography based on the return to work and the vaccination rates that people saw seeing. And so I would say that's where we are seeing fairly long term orders come in and people are saying, okay, we may have to move it a month or two or three, is what actually happens from a vaccination point of view.
And then I alluded to this a little bit in my prepared remarks, the 30 millionth IP phone that we shipped. We are seeing a surprising, a wonderful recovery really on the voice side and we believe that what's triggering that is a return of SMBs back to the office even prior to some of the biggest enterprises. And so there's a desire to get away from a traditional PBX phone and to get to more of a cloud-based solution tied to phones or RingCentral, et cetera, et cetera. And so that's driving a fairly significant demand at the SMB sector on the voice side.
Paul Silverstein
Can I, just on that last point? I want to make sure I understand what you are saying. But when you look at the numbers, voice was $64 million in the quarter, down from $95 million in the earlier quarter and from $67 million. So it was relatively flat or flattish sequentially but it was still down a healthy clip, maybe not surprising. But the demand you are referring to, with SMBs coming back within U.S. and revenue with it, is that you looking at it, I assume, on a week-to-week and month-to-month basis because we can't see it for the quarter, I assume that strength is being reflected real-time?
Dave Shull
That is correct. That's looking at pipeline data, right. That's looking at the mix of products that's coming through within that revenue mix as well, to be to be clear. I think I said on one of my earliest conference calls, I forget which one it was, but I don't expect it to get back to the full $95 million, for example, that we had in Q4 of 2020. But we are seeing a quicker recovery, I guess I would say, than I had originally anticipated which is obviously a good thing. And it's driven primarily by the SMB market, which again is a bit of a different dynamic than we expected whereas the larger enterprise are very focused on the video capability and the buildout of that over a longer period of time.
Paul Silverstein
One last question, if I may. We have heard from virtually every company in network and comm equipment and throughout technology about the budget constraints. The overwhelming majority of those have cited challenges, increasing challenges but that they are effectively managing and the issue isn't meaningful, it is de minimis, moderate here now. There have been some others, not just yourself, that have cited a bigger impact. But you are one of the largest, if not the largest peer now in fact. Is that by virtue, meaning that's not surprising given that you are in the voice segment? But the challenges you are seeing, is that across voice, video and headsets? Is it predominant one versus the other? Is it getting worse and worse week-by-week, month-by-month? Or any incremental insight you can share with us?
Dave Shull
Yes. So let me provide a bit more color commentary. I mentioned Grant a couple of times when I talked about sort of the new hires that we have had. There's actually been a pretty significant set of new hires that Grant has brought in on top of that. And so as part of that, we have done a pretty comprehensive audit of all of our supplier relationships. And I sat down and matter of fact talked to some of our biggest chipset manufacturers in the world at a very senior level and explained to them our roadmap, explained to them the 700% growth that we are seeing on the video side. They are thrilled to see that.
And I think the new leadership team that we have coming in has helped us tell a clear story. It has helped us tell a more compelling story. And that's getting a lot of attention from the supply base. So to me, that's very encouraging and that gives me very bullish sentiment, I guess I should say, with regard to the rest of this year. But we also want to be very clear which is, there was a turnaround that took place here. I think we are on a great track. But we have had some categories growing 700%.
And so to make sure that we are fully delivering on that rapidly increasing demand for our newest products, video, some of the audio products, but a lot of it is in video, we wanted to make sure they were very clear on the guidance for this quarter.
Chuck, anything you want to add to that?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. Just I think, Paul, less of an impact on headsets, more of an impact on the new video products, not so much the legacy video products and then a mixed impact on desk phones. And then to your point, Paul, things are improving. I said we were more pessimistic a couple weeks ago and we are more optimistic today.
The work that Grant and his team are doing, the work that Dave is doing talking to CEOs of these major or large scale chip providers, it's getting better. We expect Q2 to be better and to improve. We are probably not going to be out of the woods in Q2 but we think that Q2 will be significantly better from a chip supply standpoint than our Q1. And we would expect that we are, maybe not fully clear by the December quarter, but fully hopefully back to normal by the December quarter.
Paul Silverstein
Chuck I apologize if you already addressed this on the call, but I have got a follow-up on that. It's actually counterintuitive or counter to what I think most if not all other companies have been saying about the supply constraints, in particular semis, from Broadcom and other semi suppliers. So I just wanted to make sure I understand what you are saying. This is significantly better, if I heard you correctly, in Q2, that's something specific to Q2? Or you actually think that's indicative of an improving trend from a supply chain component availability standpoint?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. Again, when I say, I mean our September quarter and a lot of that is the work that Dave is doing talking with the CEOs of the chip suppliers, building those relationships, the work that Grant and team are doing as well as some purchasing in the spot market. And so we are not providing guidance obviously for our September quarter or December quarter.
But we expect that things improve in terms of chip supply as this quarter closes to next quarter. But we have contemplated in our guidance what we believe we have access to from a chip supply today and we are working with longer term arrangements in trying to negotiate longer term arrangements with our chip suppliers.
Paul Silverstein
All right. I will take the rest offline. I appreciate the insights. Thanks.
Chuck Boynton
Thank you Paul.
Dave Shull
Thanks Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line up Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.
Greg Burns
Good afternoon. How much, if any, was revenue impacted this quarter from any supply component constraints?
Dave Shull
So in our Q4 quarter, our March quarter, we did have impact for sure. We haven't quantified that specifically. But I think revenue could have been, I would ballpark it, $10 million, $20 million higher. We still have elevated backlog and it's higher than we would like it to be. It is shifted a little bit from headsets to the new video products. But we haven't provided specific numbers. But I think realistically, Q4 could have been much stronger even if we didn't have constraints in Q4.
Greg Burns
Okay. And we really get the headset business relative to what we saw from some others in this space, it seems like your growth isn't that strong or maybe you are losing some market share due to maybe some of the supply chain issues. But maybe just talk about relative growth rates, if you are gaining or losing share in the headset market?
Chuck Boynton
So in terms of --
Dave Shull
Go ahead. Chuck, go ahead.
Chuck Boynton
Okay. I don't want to necessarily compare us to our competition because in different cases we compete in different categories. But if you look overall at the office headsets, the traditional Bluetooth headsets, I think the growth rates have been fairly comparable. As you know, Greg, we have a higher concentration of contact center. And that business is not yet recovering.
And then importantly, we have new products like our wireless speakers, the Sync line, Sync 20, 40 and 60 that has really great growth opportunities. We do have supply constraints in some of those products. So I think we are doing quite well in some of the key categories that we compete in.
Greg Burns
Okay. And then in terms of those new products, the Sync, the speakerphones and the P Series, where are we at in terms of the launch of those products? Are you currently selling them all in market? And how is the initial market reaction to the products been?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. The Sync 20 and 40 are in market and we are just now releasing the Sync 60. I would say the market response to, especially the 40 has been phenomenal. It's a balance of size and portability which seems to be resonating pretty well for the work-from-home folks. The Studio P Series, we announced them in February. They are in markets at relatively low volumes, honestly, given the supply issues.
But so far the feedback on particularly the P15 has been excellent. We mentioned a few of the design awards that we won for the entire P Series. And I think you will see a lot of ramp-up on that based on conversations we have had with customers, I think, as they are looking for something that works both in the office but also at home.
Greg Burns
Okay. And then you are talking about getting more of businesses infrastructure being more involved and the software and services. So what does that entail? Is that going to mean Lens becomes bigger part of your overall package? So like how should we think about that? And then maybe what the growth of services overtime might look like, given that it's been down the last couple of years.
Dave Shull
Greg, I want to ask you to come back on the 20th to hear more detail. I would rather kind of but that comprehensively in place so you can see a clear vision there. Very good question.
Greg Burns
All right. Thanks.
Dave Shull
Thanks Greg.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from [indiscernible].
Meta Marshall
Great. Thanks. Maybe first question for me and kind of two questions that hit the more ideas. But you noted kind of a longer duration of video demand that you think you are seeing. In your conversations with customers, is that longer duration because people are kind of operating in a more orderly fashion? Like maybe they want to do 10% of their coverage of the month? Or is it that you expect kind of different customers to hit at different times? And then maybe similar question on the desk phone side. Is the demand pickup that you are seeing, is that specific to maybe hotelling setups that are going into place or maybe you just refresh activity that was paused in 2020 finally starting to take place? Thanks.
Dave Shull
This is Dave. Good question. So on the video side, we are seeing a couple of factors. Some of it is a move from, I guess, local on-premises gear to the cloud. And that tends to be fairly industry-specific So we are seeing a fair amount of activity in financial services, for example, where people are looking at a couple of the cloud providers and looking to make a transition.
As they look at that, they are looking at POCs on the hardware components of that to make sure that they fully understand all the, I guess I would call it sort of transformation steps that they need to take to go from on-prem to cloud. And so we do expect that to, a lot of it's happening right now but I would say the revenue will ramp once they get to the POCs, they make a final decision in terms of the cloud collaboration platform that they want to use and they start to roll the hardware out. And so we are expecting that to continue over the next few quarters. And that's a global phenomenon with a lot of these very, very large companies.
Specifically, with regard to some of the longer term question marks that I mentioned, in Europe it varies by country tremendously the vaccination rate that we are seeing. And so there's been a few countries where people have, they are about to place orders and saying, well, there might be three months delay, right. We are still very interested in doing it. But we got to figure out exactly when the vaccination rate is going to get to a point where the government's going to allow us to actually go back into the office. And so bump along with POCs for a while and the you see sort of a pretty substantial pull of the trigger as they try to actually execute on it.
The audio stuff is twofold. The voice stuff that I mentioned is twofold. One is, we are seeing direct demand now for SMB customers, especially if you are in the States, coming back and wanting to get off of whatever PBX system they had and wanted to get something that is Teams or Zoom or RingCentral based. And so those are direct orders that are happening now.
With regard to the larger enterprises, it's a bit of the same sort of POC mindset. They made the decision to get away from on-premises gear and they are kind of walking their way and they are saying, okay, we are going to do a bit of a bigger trial, we are going to do a bit of an audio or voice trial and we will see how that kind of happens over time. So a bunch of different kind of dynamics there to your questions or concerns.
Meta Marshall
Yes. That's great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is now open.
Paul Chung
Hi. This is Paul Chung, on for Coster. Thanks for taking the question. So just on the sell-through dynamic on, I think, slide 17. If you can confirm, is that just for new products in video? And then if you could comment on the balance between overall sell-through versus sell-in in video? You mentioned channel inventory was flattish overall. So any comments there?

Certainly, Paul. Yes, slide 17 shows the trended sell-through for new video products, specifically, X Series, G7500, the new P Series. And we have really seen incredible growth, 700% year over year and we expect, absent chip shortage, that trend is continuing. These new products are selling incredibly well. Today two-thirds of our revenue comes from the new products in video. Only a third from the legacy products and 90% of the units. And so demand is far outstripping supply. And we would expect that to continue.
As it relates to our channel inventory, I would say, we are in a pretty good place at the end of the quarter. Now, as the chip shortage is manifesting, we expect channel inventories to go down significantly. In some cases, they are unhealthily low in some areas and they are appropriate in others. And so I think on balance, it's probably a little lower than it should be right now, but it's healthy. I would expect that unfortunately channel inventories will decline this quarter and we expect backlog would continue to grow.
Paul Chung
Got you. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then as we think about the kind of make up of video collaboration, can you kind of provide some extra details around the split between webcams or desktops and holo rooms and large conference rooms? And then kind of the respective growth rates you saw for each of those segments? And how you think that kind of trends overtime for this year? Is there some kind of bulk buying ahead of workers going back to the office or is this kind of a sustainable piece here?
Chuck Boynton
I think we will cover more of that at Analyst Day. But maybe, Dave, you can provide a little bit of color now.
Dave Shull
Yes. I was going to actually suggest the same thing. We are actually going to have Beau Wilder who runs our video business unit presenting at Analyst Day. And he is going to be able to go a lot deeper. And again, I think sort of as a broader context which I think should be very, very helpful.
We are seeing, similar to the answer I guess what I gave Meta, we are seeing a lot of trialing now with sort of standalone, what we call single codec devices, our Studio X30 and our X50 products. We are seeing people start to experiment a little bit back with the larger comp insurance thinking that maybe they need something a little bit of larger that's suitable for sort of COVID spacing. And so it's a bit of a tale of two cities, but let me Beau provide a bit more detail, I think, in a week. I think that would be more helpful.
Paul Chung
Okay. And then last question. Very good performance in enterprise headsets. Is this the kind of new quarterly run rate, north of $200 million kind of moving forward? And then you mentioned kind of switch to Bluetooth relative to maybe wired. Will that weigh on margins at all to any extent? And then are you seeing any evidence from contact center demand coming back? Thank you.
Dave Shull
Let me answer the last one first. And then Chuck can feel free to weigh in. We are seeing very, very little uptick in demand on the contact center side. I think there's a fair migration to USB. And maybe now they are evaluating Bluetooth. So, no is a simple answer to that. And that's really where the margin benefit was.
With regard to Bluetooth and Blackwire, there's obviously a significant ASP difference. But there's not as much of a margin difference. And so we are glad to have the higher ASP products because I do think they are stickier but we will see how that migration happens.
Chuck, anything you want to add to that?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. I would just say that's right. I mean margin percent is a little higher on Bluetooth than Blackwire, not meaningfully but margin dollars are quite a bit higher. So as Dave mentioned, the migration from corded to cordless is a real benefit, both to revenue and margin dollars on a per unit basis and should be beneficial.
Relative to your question on, is this the kind of like the new level for headsets? I think so. I mean if you look at industry growth rates and we will talk about this more at Analyst Day in a week, they are projecting headset growth from these levels from a TAM standpoint. It's hard to say and we are not providing a detailed quarterly guidance here but I think we do expect the market to continue to expand. And I think given our leadership position and the strength of our technology in some of the new product offerings, we expect that we can grow along with or perhaps even faster than the market.
Paul Chung
Thank you. Very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein
I just wanted to take a second bite of the apple. I should have asked you, the $60-plus million of foregone revenue in the June quarter based upon the guidance you gave, if you were up sequentially, it would be at least $60 million, I am assume it would be more than that because that won't be up very much at all. But that revenue due to supply constraints, I assume, because everybody is in the same boat with regards to supply constraints that it's simply a matter of deferring shipments in rev rec as opposed to losing that revenue to Logitech or other competitors? But let me ask you the open question. Any risk that other suppliers will be able to satisfy, that mainly goes away? Or is it simply there's a timing issue?
Dave Shull
I want to add, this is Dave. I am going to answer it as a tale of two cities and Chuck can feel free to provide more color, if he wants. So with regard to some of the SMB buyers on some of our, I hate to even use this word, less differentiated products, some of our voice products, for example, some of the phones, yes, I think some of the demand is a bit perishable because it's just less unique from a technology point of view.
With regard to the largest enterprises, the Fortune 500, Global 1000, we have a long term relationship with many of these companies and are looking for a multi-year rollout. And so I think a quarter or so of hiccup is not the end of that. I mean, that's just from a longer term relationship there is. I think a lot of the video stuff is going to have a much longer shelf life, I guess, is what I would say. Of course, we are trying to execute on it as quickly as possible for all of our sakes. But on the voice side, there is some risk.
Chuck?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. I think that's well said, Dave.
Paul Silverstein
Can I ask just one quick follow-up. Any way to quantify how much is one versus other?
Dave Shull
I don't have it, even if I wanted to.
Chuck Boynton
Yes.
Dave Shull
Sorry. I am sorry, Chuck. You can't kick me before I give the answer.
Paul Silverstein
I apologize. You don't have that information?
Chuck Boynton
Yes. I mean, I think ultimately, Paul, what I would say is the pipeline supports significant growth. The pipeline deals tend to be enterprise transactions with the large scale enterprises. And I think that they are doing long-term RFPs. We will retain that business. The commodity purchases that are short term, the long tail SMB, I can't really quantify or break that out for you.
Paul Silverstein
But I guess, that's the real question. What I am, again, driving at obviously is to what extent does this impact your long term demand, your long term revenue growth rate? How much of this is customers that will shift away from Poly to one of your competitors because they have the ability to satisfy that demand and creating a new relationship away from you and it sounds like you are saying that it's a small piece of the pipeline.
Chuck Boynton
I don't think it impacts the long term thesis at all. I really don't. I think that this is a market where we have seen our competitors not be able to meet supply and demand and we have had the same challenges. And when you win a long term strategic account, then they stick with you. If it's truly a jump ball, we may lose that. But I think we will get that back right away. And so, I don't think this changes the long term thesis at all.
Paul Silverstein
All right. I appreciate it. Thank you again.
Dave Shull
Thanks Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.
Greg Burns
Sorry. I tried to hop out. Paul beat me to it. So my question has been answered. Thanks.
Dave Shull
Thanks Greg.
Operator
Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Turning over back to you, Dave.
Dave Shull
Thanks all. I really appreciate the engagement and the time. I am going to reiterate actually what Chuck said. I remain very, very optimistic about the longer term thesis here. And again, I am fairly new on the CEO role. And so it's never fun to issue a downward guidance, but I would rather just be straight with you all. By the same token, I remain very, very bullish for the year and for the next couple of years to come. And again, we will share much more of that at Analyst Day. And I appreciate everyone's time and look forward to talking to you all next week. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
