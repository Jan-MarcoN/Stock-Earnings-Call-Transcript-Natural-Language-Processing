Good day and welcome to the SanDisk third quarter 2014 financial results conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jay Iyer. Please go ahead, sir.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. With me on the call are Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk, and Judy Bruner, Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. In a moment, we will hear remarks from both of them, followed by Q&A.
Before we begin, please note that any non-GAAP financial measures being discussed during the call, as defined by the SEC in Regulation G, will be reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
That reconciliation is now available along with supplemental schedules on our website at SanDisk.com/ir. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance will also be posted on our website. This guidance is exclusive of any one-time transactions and does not reflect the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures, or similar transactions that may be completed after October 16, 2014.
In addition, during our call today we will make forward-looking statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other future events. Please refer to todayâs press release and our SEC filings, including the most recent 10-Q, for information on the risk factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. SanDisk assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak as of today.
This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Fusion-io, Inc. is being made solely by means of the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and related documents, which contain the full terms and conditions of the tender offer and have been mailed to Fusion-io's stockholders and filed with the SEC. Investors and security holders of Fusion-io are urged to read these and other documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents carefully in their entirety when they become available, because they contain or will contain important information about the proposed transaction.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to report record revenue, strong earnings and cash flow, and to have returned more than half a billion dollars of capital to shareholders during the quarter.
With the acquisition of Fusion-io, SanDisk now has the most comprehensive enterprise portfolio in the industry. Our solutions range from the highest performance, lowest latency products that enable application acceleration and disrupt traditional IT architectures, to products that have a compelling value proposition to replace hard drives in a variety of applications.
This portfolio, coupled with our broad and expanding customer reach and well established vertical integration capabilities, positions us well to accelerated our momentum in the fast-growing market for enterprise flash. We expect our enterprise SSD revenue to surpass $1 billion in 2015, a year ahead of our previously stated timeline.
Our enterprise SSD revenue grew strongly on a year over year basis during the third quarter, driven by our SaaS leadership position and growing presence in enterprise SATA, and it was further bolstered by a partial quarter of revenues from Fusion-io solutions. 
We have now converted the vast majority of Smart Storageâs products to captive NAND flash and this provides us with an important advantage as we pursue several large opportunities with hyperscale customers.
We are delighted to report first revenue shipments of ULLtraDIMM, our high-performance, low-latency SSDs to leading server and storage OEMs. [Design] traction for ULLtraDIMM SSDs continues to grow with successful qualifications at Super Micro Computer and Huawei, achieve in the third quarter.
The Fusion-io business performed in line with our expectations post-acquisition. On the product front, multiple OEMs have now qualified and are offering our next-generation Fusion-io PCIe products. Our plan is to continue supporting the majority of Fusion-io products on non-captive NANDs in 2015.
In addition to the growth of the enterprise SSD portfolio, we are pleased that Dell will begin incorporating SanDisk DAS Cache software into certain Dell-powered edge servers as part of the base configuration.
This FlashSoft server side caching software that allows customers to benefit from server attached SSDs as a cache, for an applicationâs most frequently accessed data. Following the completion of the Fusion-io acquisition in late July, we have made excellent progress in integrating Fusion-io into SanDisk.
To best realize the capabilities, talent, and scale of the two teams, we have decided to accelerate the combination of the legacy SanDisk enterprise storage solutions group and the newly added Fusion-io team by forming one enterprise storage organization under John Scaramuzzo.
As planned at the time of the acquisition of Fusion-io, the sales team has been integrated under the leadership of Henri Richard. Lance Smith has decided to leave SanDisk to pursue other opportunities.
In client SSDs, we saw healthy year over year revenue growth as attach rate of SSDs to PCs continues to increase, and our overall market share position remains strong. During the quarter, we had a successful launch of our X3-based SanDisk Ultra II SSD for retail and the product has garnered several awards from top reviewers.
We also began shipment of our 1Y nanometer X2 SSDs and qualification efforts for our 1Y nanometer X3 SSDs are underway with multiple OEM customers. Our combined sales from enterprise and client SSDs drove 27% of our third quarter revenue.
Trying to mobile embedded, the launch of several new smartphones containing our embedded solutions enabled healthy sequential revenue growth with particular strength from sales growth of custom embedded solutions. We believe that Appleâs decision to increase the embedded storage in their mid-tier and top-tier iPhone to 64 GB and 128 GB respectively is indicative of pent-up consumer demand for higher storage capacities.
We expect other OEMs to follow suit by increasing their embedded storage capacities in their respective offerings and this bodes well for the prospects for our iNAND portfolio as well, as well as the overall demand for [unintelligible] flash. 
We are pleased with the broadening customer traction of our embedded X3 solution. Our X3 flash and systems technology capabilities allow our customers to increase overall mobile device capacities at competitive cost structures while still delivering outstanding application experience.
In retail, revenue increased slightly from the previous quarter but declined modestly on a year over year basis with growth in Micro SD cards offset by decline in SD cards. Our over global retail presence remain solid, backed by our valuable brand and consumer recognition of our high-quality products. We are positioned well as we head into the seasonally strong period of the year. 
Turning to industry demand, we continue to see multiple strong growth drivers for flash, and the demand outlook remains robust. Even as mobile market shares shift among different OEMs, overall smartphone shipments remain on a strong trajectory and we are very pleased to see the average capacity growth in these devices drive strong demand for flash.
In client computing, Iâm sure you will agree with me that once you have become used to an SSD-powered laptop, there is no going back. Consequently, the increasing penetration rate of flash in corporate laptops will spill into the consumer space and drive significant growth in flash penetration in the PC platforms in the years ahead.
Finally, enterprise and hyperscale customers continue to work with market leaders like SanDisk to find new ways to use flash in an ever-increasing number of applications and workloads, as flash technology is a critical foundation of the modern day responsive enterprise. To summarize, we believe that near term and secular demand drivers for flash remain strong, and we continue to be confident in the future prospects for the industry.
Trying to fab operations and technology, we completed the planned 5% wafer capacity expansion in Fab 5 phase one, bringing SanDiskâs annualized wafer capacity to approximately 2.8 wafers. We also recently celebrated the opening of Fab 5 phase two and we have started moving equipment into the new clean room to support our 15 nanometer node RAM. 
We are on track to begin product shipments of 15 nanometer this quarter, with meaningful production in Q1 of 2015. We believe our 15 nanometer technology node, using both X2 and X3 architectures, will be the lowest cost memory technology in the industry in 2015, with capability to serve all product apps, ranging from consumer to enterprise.
As we discussed last quarter, our mix of 1Y nanometer production is relatively consistent through the second half of 2014 at 60%, while we maintain a long tail of 19 nanometer production for strategic customers and begin our 15 nanometer production ramp in Q4.
Our estimate of industry supply [bit] growth for 2014 is slightly below 40% and SanDisk captive bit supply will be slightly below 25%, given the long tail of 19 nanometer production. For 2015, both 19 nanometer and 1Y production will continue even as we ramp 15 nanometer.
We continue to prudently manage our capacity expansion to ensure appropriate ROI, given the future transitions to 3D. With this in mind, we are planning an approximate 5% capacity expansion in 2015. 
This capacity expansion, along with our technology transitions, results in expected captive supply bit growth in the range of 30% to 40%. For the industry, our estimates for 2015 supply bit growth are also in the range of 30% to 40% and we continue to expect a healthy industry supply demand environment in 2015. 
Our 3D NAND technology development continues to make good progress and we expect to be in pilot production in the second half of 2015, with target volume production in 2016. I would now like to take a moment to recognize and congratulate my dear friend, Dr. Eli Harari, founder and retired chairman and CEO of SanDisk, who was recently honored by President Obama with the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.
This award is the highest honor the United States can bestow to recognize Eliâs leadership in advancing the field of science and technology. Eliâs contributions have had immeasurable impact on our lives and society. We are incredibly proud and honored to have been a part of the journey that Eli pioneered over two and a half decades ago. Congratulations, Eli, on this well-deserved and prestigious award.
To conclude, we are pleased with our third quarter results. We are driving hard in innovation and execution, in a vibrant industry with strong secular demand drivers. SanDisk has an industry-leading solutions portfolio and roadmap, and our deep ecosystem and customer engagement are second to none. 
Our outstanding technology, systems engineering, supply chain capabilities, and our ability to attract key talent are key competitive advantages for us, and we believe we have what it takes to create new, differentiated opportunities for our business and continue to be a leader in our market. We look forward to completing a record 2014 and to executing on our plan for another strong year in 2015. 
With that, I will turn over the call to Judy for the financial review and outlook.
Judy Bruner 
Thank you, Sanjay. Q3 was another strong quarter for SanDisk, with revenue growing 7% year over year to an all-time record of $1.75 billion. We delivered excellent gross margins, very strong free cash flow, and non-GAAP operating margin of 28%, even with restructuring charges and the inclusion of the Fusion-io business.
With rapid progress on our integration initiatives, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of Fusion-io being accretive to earnings in the second half of 2015. On a year over year basis, our commercial channel revenue grew 13%, while retail revenue was down 2%. 
The primary source of our growth in the commercial channel was SSDs, both enterprise and client solutions. Within the retail channel, sales of SD cards decreased due to the declining camera market, partially offset by growth in demand for micro SD cards.
Sequentially, our commercial revenue grew 8%, driven by embedded growth, and our retail revenue grew 5%, driven by back to school USB sales and mobile cards. Sales in the retail channel comprised 32% of our Q3 revenue mix, compared to 35% in the year ago quarter.
Our total petabytes sold increased 9% sequentially and 43% year over year. Our captive bit sales grew faster than our captive bit supply, resulting in further reduction to our captive inventory levels. Our overall inventory increased sequentially because of the non-captive inventory acquired in the Fusion-io transaction.
Looking at revenue by product category, our SSD revenue grew 48% year over year, with the strongest growth coming from enterprise SSDs. Sequentially, our SSD revenue grew 1% with growth in enterprise SSD revenue offset by a decline from client SSD.
The sequential decline in client SSD revenue reflected demand timing from certain customers as well as our own supply allocation decisions. Our embedded revenue was down 16% year over year, and up 30% sequentially.
The sequential increase in embedded revenue came from both custom embedded and iNAND solutions. Our removable products revenue, which includes sales in both retail and commercial channels, was flat year over year and up 1% sequentially.
Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin increased sequentially to 49%, benefitting from a stronger mix of product sales and a higher usage of X3 memory, which made up more than 50% of our revenue bits. Our blended price per gigabyte and cost per gigabyte both came down 3% sequentially, inclusive of the impact of product mix and average capacity growth.
1Y nanometer technology comprised approximately two-thirds of our petabytes sold, and the yen rate in our cost of sales was 101, consistent with the rate in the second quarter. 
Our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $63 million sequentially, with $25 million of the increase reflecting restructuring charges and the remainder of the growth driven by 10 weeks of Fusion-io operating expenses. 
Without the impact of Fusion-io, SanDiskâs standalone expenses were approximately flat from the second quarter, less than originally forecasted, primarily due to the timing of certain R&D expenditures.
Restructuring expenses were $10 million less than originally forecasted, largely due to lower charges for IT integration and employee severance. Related to the Fusion-io acquisition, our GAAP costs and expenses also include $11 million of stock compensation charges related to acceleration of Fusion-io equity awards held by certain former Fusion-io employees, $17 million related to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and $5 million of inventory step-up charges.
Our non-GAAP Q3 diluted share count declined sequentially by 1.9 million shares, as share repurchases more than offset dilution from the 2017 warrants and employee shares. Our non-GAAP tax rate came down slightly and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.45, inclusive of restructuring charges.
Q3 cash flow from operations was a robust $588 million, and cash used for capital investments was $116 million, yielding free cash flow of $471 million. During Q3, our capital return was $525 million, including $458 million spent on share buybacks and $67 million delivered to shareholders in cash dividends.
On a year to date basis, total capital return stands at 95% of free cash flow, and we have repurchased 8.75 million shares.
Our share of joint venture fab investments during Q3 was $243 million, and non-fab capital purchases were $87 million, bringing total year to date gross capital purchases to approximately $870 million.
Our Q3 fab capital investments were funded by joint venture working capital, $60 million of operating leases, and a net $29 million contribution from SanDisk. Our cash flow statement also reflects $1.07 billion spent on the Fusion-io acquisition, which is net of $190 million of cash acquired.
On the balance sheet, our inventory dollars grew by $30 million sequentially, inclusive of $77 million of non-captive inventory received in the Fusion-io acquisition. Our captive inventory has fallen two quarters in a row, and while we entered the year expecting to draw down inventory, we now have pockets of supply constraint exacerbated by the lower 2014 supply bit growth resulting from the long tail of 19 nanometer production for strategic customers.
I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. For the fourth quarter, we have strong demand signals from our customers in all key product categories. We expect to further reduce our captive inventory levels in Q4 to fulfil demand. However, we expect to be in supply allocation and this will constrain our growth in some areas in Q4.
We will prioritize our business according to our strategic priorities and customer relationships. Our fourth quarter revenue forecast is $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion. As we look to 2015, we plan to increase our supply bit growth from less than 25% this year to a range of 30% to 40%. Given the lean level of inventory we will have at the end of 2014, our 2015 revenue bit growth will likely need to be at the low end of that range.
For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 47% and 49%. Our yen rate in the fourth quarter is determined primarily by third quarter purchases, which include some hedges placed approximately a year ago, yielding an expected fourth quarter yen rate in cost of sales similar to the rate in the last two quarters.
Our Q4 2014 wafer purchases, which will impact Q1 2015 cost of sales, will be based approximately on two-thirds market rate purchases in Q4 and one third on hedges placed a year ago at approximately 99. 
With the current yen denominated content in our cost of sales, a 10% move in the yen rate in our cost of sales generates approximately a 200 basis point change in our gross margin. To date, we have not placed any hedges for 2015, so if market rates stay comparable to today, this will be a benefit to 2015 costs. 
We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting a full quarter of Fusion-io related expenses and inclusive of restructuring expenses of approximately $15 million. Q4 non-GAAP other income is forecasted at approximately $3 million, and we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be equal to the Q3 rate of 31.2%.
We expect our Q4 non-GAAP diluted share count to come down to approximately $228 million, reflecting continued share repurchases.
We are refining our estimate of 2014 capital investments from $1.4 billion to $1.3 billion, with Q4 gross investments expected to be approximately $400 million inclusive of both joint venture and non-fab investments.
The fourth quarter cash usage for capital investments is expected to be approximately $150 million, bringing the full year cash usage for capital investments to approximately $350 million for the combination of joint venture and non-fab investments. 
In summary, we expect that 2014 will be another record year in both revenue and earnings. With the broadest portfolio of enterprise and consumer flash solutions in the industry, SanDisk is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the future while also generating strong free cash flow and executing a market leading capital return program.
We will now open the call for your questions. 
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Judy. Thank you, Sanjay. Operator, can I ask you to poll the floor for questions. And if I can ask the callers to limit themselves to one question and a brief follow up.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions.] And we do have our first question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group 
Judy, a quick follow up on your guide. What would be the pro forma gross margin excluding [unintelligible] restructuring?
Judy Bruner 
The restructuring expenses are included on a separate line in our P&L in expense operating expenses, and so the restructuring expenses are not impacting gross margin. So my guide for the Q4 gross margin is 47% to 49% on a non-GAAP basis, and thatâs not impacted by restructuring.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group 
And then one follow up for Sanjay, as you start ramping the 15 nanometer, how should we think about the impact on your cost structure, since different competitors have a different die size? So can you either qualitatively or quantitatively talk about the decline in the die size, how it would impact your cost structure per bit? Because when I look at it on the surface, 1Y to 15 nanometer doesnât seem huge, but Iâm just wondering if your die is different than competitors, and how it would impact the cost per bit.
Sanjay Mehrotra 
We believe we have the smallest die in production. We will have the smallest die in production with our 1Z nanometer, which we are starting to ramp this quarter. And our 1Z, we believe, will continue to give us the lowest-cost die in X2, as well as with X3 memories. And remember, at the product level, the total cost is the cost of the flash memory as well as cost of all the non-flash memory components that go into our overall product cost structure.
And with respect to 1Z, at the memory level itself, in terms of cost reduction capability, 1Z technology, transition from 1Z to 1Y will give us more cost reduction than the transition from 19 nanometer to 1Y. But our cost leadership in the industry will continue, with our 1Z. Again, the smallest die and the lowest cost die in production at the memory level, in the industry.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group 
So the takeaway here is the 1Y to 1Z is more cost reduction than 19 to 1Y, correct?
Sanjay Mehrotra 
Thatâs correct at the memory level.
Operator
Our next question is from Doug Freedman of RBC Capital Markets. 
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets 
Judy, one of the things Iâm struggling with, it looks like your reported inventory actually went up, but it sounds like itâs a mix-related issue, and youâre telling us, if I heard correctly, that we should expect some pockets of demand that go unserviced in the fourth quarter. What do you think will happen to that demand? Will you be able to service that in Q1 of 2015?
Judy Bruner 
So just to clarify first, on the inventory, the inventory dollars in total did go up, but that was driven by the non-captive inventory that we acquired as part of the Fusion-io acquisition. Our captive inventory, which we need for servicing the vast majority of our demand, actually went down for the second quarter in a row. And the non-captive inventory is earmarked for the Fusion-io related products and business.
We will work hard in the fourth quarter to meet the needs of our customers and service the demand out there, but we do, as I said, expect to have pockets of supply constraint. And we will be implementing another capacity expansion, as Sanjay described, in 2015, in order to build some capacity. And in terms of overall demand, we believe our strategic customers, we will work very closely with them, and that demand will not go away for SanDisk.
Doug Freedman - RBC Capital Markets 
And if I could, for my follow up, you talked in the past about introducing more three bit per cell SSD products. Can you give us an update on how that is going? And if you wouldnât mind, maybe in answering that, giving us an idea of how much bit growth, moving from MLC output to TLC will contribute.
Sanjay Mehrotra 
So in terms of client SSD with X3, we are making very good progress there, and these products with X3 are in qualification stages with customers. We look at it more as a 2015, the X3 revenue, unfortunately in client SSD for us. It will continue to ramp up primarily from Q1 onward timeframe.
In terms of X3 mix in our total product sales, X3 mix will increase next year compared to this year, but itâs all baked in our bit growth guidance that we have provided today.
 
Operator
Next we have a question from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company 
First of all, Judy, can you break out the FIO portion of revenue and cost to sort of help us see where results would have been ex-Fusion-io?
Judy Bruner 
Weâre not going to break out the specific Fusion-io related revenue and cost, but I will tell you that the Fusion-io revenue was down sequentially from the prior run rate of the Fusion business, and that was our expectation. So the revenue level met our expectation. We expected that it would be down sequentially, of course due to the fact that it only included 10 weeks versus 13 weeks, but also due to the integration of the business and the sales force. They had a fairly large sales force, and we needed to integrate that into SanDisk, determine account ownership, territory leadership, commission plans, etc.
So overall, weâre very pleased with how that integration is going, and we believe that the Fusion-io revenue will grow from this point forward. Also, I will tell you that the Fusion-io gross margin, even using non-captive memory, is accretive to the SanDisk gross margin, meaning the Fusion-io product gross margin is higher than the corporate average of the SanDisk gross margin.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company 
And then Sanjay, I wanted to get your perspective on this news that XMC is partnering with Spansion to develop 3D NAND and theyâre claiming that theyâre going to be producing it in 2017. I just wanted to get your view on that, whether thatâs plausible, and whether thatâs something that youâre thinking about.
Sanjay Mehrotra 
You know, my view is that NAND is a highly complex device technology. You know, the device structure, the manufacturing process technologies. These really are absolutely leading edge in the entire semiconductor industry. And to build experience in this and to be successful in this really requires many generations of the technology transition capability under your belt, just like the flash suppliers in the industry today have. 
So I believe that it is very hard for a new entrant to catch up [with] a leading edge technology node, with building a flash memory that has the reliability, that has the overall cost structure and overall specifications that are required to meet the broad range of market applications. And not only technology complexity, of course to be a successful player in this you require scale of operations as well.
So I look at this really, at this point, given the barriers to entry with respect to technology learning curve, manufacturing learning curve, as well as the scale of production and all the IP considerations that go into building a leading edge flash technology roadmap, I see this really as a very uphill task, and I donât see this as something for a new entrant to become successful or for us to worry about, frankly.
And of course the systems expertise is also required. Today, flash is not just about making a NAND flash memory chip. It is about control of [unintelligible], all the product solutions are really all about system level expertise as well.
Operator
We have a question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley & Company. 
Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company
I wanted to go back to the comments that the company would see 30% to 40% bit supply growth next year. Can you help us understand what the parameters are that would differentiate the company coming in closer to the low end of that range versus the company coming in closer to the high end of that range?
Judy Bruner 
First of all, the 30% to 40% bit supply growth bakes into it the approximately 5% capacity expansion that Sanjay described. Also bakes in the technology transition with 1Z ramping across the year, and bakes in a higher X3 mix in our revenue next year than in our revenue this year. 
So those three areas as well would be the key areas where we could be higher or lower across the year. It will depend on the yield ramp of our 1Z technology, and also on the demand that we see for our X3-based products, and of course on the fab productivity. We are always looking for ways to get more wafer output through fab productivity investments, such as installing bottleneck tools, and those will also be areas of focus in 2015.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company 
And then as the follow up, I think in the past when the companyâs gone through a manufacturing transition, thereâs generally, once it starts rolling, about a 10% to 15% per quarter mix towards that new node. Is that the right framework to look at for the 15 nanometer ramp, and if so, when would the company expect to see the current tightness that youâre seeing in the business alleviate somewhat so you were able to capture all of the demand that you see out there. 
Sanjay Mehrotra 
The 1Z technology node will be primarily [unintelligible] meaningful starting from Q1 of next year and will continue to ramp up into production throughout the course of 2015 timeframe. And as Judy pointed out, it is also about qualifying various products with our customers using that 1Z technology node.
I would expect the ramp of 1Z technology node, at the end of next year, to achieve a similar percentage in terms of [unintelligible] output [unintelligible] as 1Y has now. That means 1Z technology mix at the end of next year to be around 60%. And as we said, production ramp is starting this quarter, becoming meaningful from Q1, and continuing to ramp during the course of the year.
And again, that is all baked into our revenue base as well as the supply bit guidance.
Craig Ellis - B. Riley & Company 
And when would the current tightness be alleviated with that ramp?
Sanjay Mehrotra 
We see strong demand in all product categories for our business in 2015 timeframe. And SanDiskâs focus will continue to be to have the best mix in terms of high-value solutions in our revenue. And I believe we are really executing very well in that strategy. I mean, when you look at the 2014 timeframe, we have outgrown the industry in terms of revenue. That means our revenue growth is on track, I believe, to be higher in 2014 than the industry revenue growth. 
In 2015, I see that our revenue dollar share will continue to outperform our revenue bit share, and then all the strong demand drivers that we see in 2015, it is likely that certain pockets of supply constraint may exist during the course of the year. But this is something we have become very good at managing in terms of the overall mix of the business to achieve the best combination of revenue, profits, and cash flow, as well as really address the key considerations for our strategic customers and continue to drive the long term growth of the company. 
Operator
Our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets 
I think a quick follow up on Fusion-io. What percentage of the bits sold, of the 9%, was due to Fusion-io?
Judy Bruner 
The Fusion-io bits used are actually a pretty small number of bits. These are all non-captive. And I would tell you that non-captive memory usage for us is a low single digit percentage of our overall bits.
Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets 
And the second one is, your largest customer was 70% of total in the first half, and what is it in Q3, and whatâs your expectation in Q4?
Judy Bruner 
For Q3, we have a customer that is 20% of our revenue, but weâre not providing a guidance for Q4.
Operator
From Mark Newman, Bernstein.
Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein
Wanted to ask questions specifically on longer-term supply and demand. Very encouraged to hear the comments on the supply constraint your seeing in the market, especially in light of the increasing content per box from iPhone recently. I guess my question, though, is, thereâs a lot of concern out there right now that demand in the market overall, not just specifically to NAND flash, may slow down. Thereâs just general concern out there. 
And so just in light of, if there is any kind of shock or surprise, global recession, or any kind of event that would reduce your demand growth expectations, I wonder if you could share with us how you would alleviate that concern. You know, thinking about your current plans of 5% capacity growth next year, looking at your inventory levels you have, which you said, excluding the Fusion-io impact are actually getting leaner, if you could explain to us what kind of flexibility you have to offset any kind of short term demand, slowing down, and what the impact would be to SanDisk. 
Judy Bruner 
Iâll take that. You know, I think that as one thinks about potential macroeconomic risks out there, that is one good reason to manage capacity prudently, which we are absolutely doing. And of course another good reason is to be focused, as we always are, on the ROI of capacity expansion, and thinking ahead to the transition ahead to 3D memory from 2D memory. But we are conscious of thinking about macroeconomic risks. We believe that the capacity expansion we have is very prudent, and we believe most likely we will have pockets of supply constraint in various times in 2015.
We grew nicely in the third quarter. We do believe there were probably some macroeconomic factors impacting us, such as within our retail business, we did see less revenue than we had expected, in certain emerging markets in the third quarter, such as Latin America, Russia, and Middle East and Africa. 
So we are conscious of that. Weâre monitoring it very closely, but I feel very comfortable with our capacity plans for 2015. We absolutely need that 5% capacity that we are planning to add.

And do you mind if I just add that in addition to our disciplined capacity strategy, taking into consideration the kinds of things you referred to, whatâs important is that SanDisk really, in our market, is uniquely positioned with a broad engagement with customers, diversified set of customers, in all markets, all channels, all end market applications, and we, as Judy has said, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions as well.
So this really positions us very well in terms of managing the mix of the businesses, regardless of the considerations that may occur in one market segment versus another segment, or one region versus another region. Our unique position, with our broad portfolio and diverse set of customers, and deep ecosystem engagement, and really tremendous sales and customer support reach, I believe is a huge advantage in us continuing to drive the business, taking into consideration all possible factors, whether macroeconomic or geopolitical in nature. 
Mark Newman - Sanford Bernstein 
But would you specifically consider, if demand was substantially lower than expected, to delay capacity expansion, or I guess another thing you can do is reduce your non-captive bit mix?
Sanjay Mehrotra 
Our non-captive bit mix is primarily for Fusion-io in the 2015 timeframe. And I feel very good about our capacity plan. Itâs a very modest addition of our capacity in 2015, with supply bit growth in the 30% to 40%. And as Judy mentioned, we need to build up some of our inventory position to service our customers well, and that puts our revenue bit growth towards the lower end of that 30% to 40% range. 
So I feel very good about the demand trends that we see in our market. I men, when you look at smartphones, the average capacities that continue to increase in smartphones, certainly you look at notebook computers, the flash attach rate to notebooks absolutely continuing to increase, and on the enterprise side, this is just early innings, and this market will continue to evolve very nicely.
So I feel pretty confident about our capacity strategy here.
Judy Bruner 
Iâll just add that we really expect to have a quite tight supply demand balance within our business across 2015. And we are focused on keeping it that way, in part in order to continue to consistently produce the world-class operating margins that we produce consistently, within our target financial model of 25% to 30%.

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs 
Can you help me understand what your expectations for ASPs are in the fourth quarter? And then if youâre able to improve your ASP through either mix or like-for-like price increases given the supply demand situation that youâve articulated?
Judy Bruner 
For the fourth quarter, we expect a very healthy supply demand environment in the industry, so we would expect price movement to be modest in the fourth quarter.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs 
And then thereâs been a fair amount of M&A in the SSD market, both [unintelligible] but also in the industry more broadly, and Iâm hoping you can help me understand if the competitive landscape has changed at all, either in terms of the competitors youâre seeing, the quality of the products that SanDisk is matching up against, or how challenging the pricing is in the SSD market specifically.
Sanjay Mehrotra 
In the SSD market, you know, there is the client market as well as the enterprise. And SanDisk, with our vertical integration capabilities and particularly in enterprise side, with the recent acquisition of Fusion-io, and in the past, starting with [unintelligible] and then Smart Storage, and then adding capabilities in the software area, I believe we have the best capabilities that are out there in terms of driving the enterprise SSD growth. 
And on the client side as well, as you have seen, we have grown revenue, I think, brilliantly well over the course of the last couple of years, in client SSD. So SanDisk really, on client SSD, as well as on the enterprise SSD side, has what it takes to continue to build its market leadership position.
Judy Bruner 
I donât think thereâs a competitor out there that can match up to the breadth of the SSD product line that we have, particularly in enterprise, with our SaaS products, our SATA products, PCIe, DDR, software on top of that. We really do have the most complete portfolio.

Our next question is from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
Sanjay, I guess my first question is Iâd like to better understand how you view your relationship with strategic customers, because clearly, I think one of the investor frustrations out there is given how tight supply is now, youâre just not really moving the dial on ASP or margin. And Iâm just kind of curious, how do you define a strategic customer, what kind of return do you need to see on that customer to make it worth your while to kind of give up some near term gains of moving mix or margin? And even with strategic customers, given how tight the environment is, why not raise pricing even with the strategic customers? If the relationship is that important, it should be a two-way street, not just a one-way street.
Sanjay Mehrotra 
I think our relationship with a broad spectrum of strategic customers is excellent and only continuing to get deeper and broader as we expand our solutions offerings, from embedded solutions to SSD solutions, to enterprise solutions. So I feel very good about SanDiskâs strategic relationship. And when you look at our results, I believe SanDisk is able to certainly deliver value to our customers and also get our customers to give value to SanDisk. Because when you look at our operating margins, in our industry, I believe theyâre the best. When you look at, by any measure in the semiconductor industry, our operating margins are among the very best.
And in terms of our price decline, if you look at it on a year over year basis, I believe we are on track to have our price decline to be less than the industry price decline in the 2014 timeframe. All of this is because of SanDiskâs capability to really have a strong portfolio of solutions, a strong value proposition for our customers, and to continue to drive a strong mix of our business as well.
And of course we focus on strategic areas, and in terms of strategic areas, things that are important for us, are areas where we can drive innovation, where our customers are driving innovation, where SanDisk is able to bring value to the customers, as well as get value from the customers. Thatâs very important, and I think we have made tremendous progress in this regard over the course of the last several quarters.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse 
And then as a follow up to Judy, just quickly two quick things. First, am I doing the math right? If I exclude FiOS from the December guide, is the core business about flat year over year? And then on the margin guidance being the same this quarter as you gave for the September quarter, I would have thought that maybe with more Fusion-io, probably a richer mix of branded retail around the holidays, and maybe some more X3, that there might have been some more gross margin upside. Just kind of curious what else is going within the mix of business, September to December, that would be kind of depressing margins a bit?
Judy Bruner 
First, the so-called legacy SanDisk business is growing quarter over quarter and year over year, even if you exclude the Fusion-io business. And in terms of the gross margins for the fourth quarter, the range of 47% to 49%, that is a similar range to what we have experienced over the last two quarters. 
And I will point out that in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a higher proportion, of course, of retail promotional activity. Thatâs always the case in terms of holiday promotions for the retail business. So that has some impact on margin. And we do expect to see growth in our overall embedded solutions revenue, and embedded is one area that has gross margins that are somewhat less than the corporate average.
But overall, 47% to 49% gross margin and an operating margin within our target financial model is really world-class performance, and we feel very good about being able to grow the revenue and produce that level of competitive operating margin and do it consistently.

CJ Muse with ISI Group. 
CJ Muse - ISI Group
I guess Sanjay, a bigger picture question for you. If you think about [unintelligible] NAND bits and reluctance to add [unintelligible] in the industry given the obsolescence factor and the eventual move to 3D, coupled with 3D likely taking longer given the yield challenges there, I guess Iâm curious, do you think weâll see a change here where pricing trends, similar to Johnâs earlier question, can start to move up? Do you start to look to sign longer contracts, a la in the DRAM side, seeing three-plus month contracts?
I think the question, or where Iâd love to hear your thoughts is the fact that itâs getting harder and harder to add bits, itâs more and more capital intensive. Why would you not ask to get paid more for that?
Sanjay Mehrotra 
So I think we have been discussing this for a couple of years, that the technology complexity in the NAND industry is increasing tremendously. Itâs taking longer to develop new technology nodes. The gain coming from each successive 2D NAND generation is smaller compared to what it was in the past. And of course, as we all know, 2D NAND is approaching the end of its life, and 3D NAND, in the future years, will start ramping into production.
So we have always said that these technology complexities do definitely bring a stabilizing effect to the industry in terms of the supply bit growth, and certainly in terms of the pricing environment as well, because the demand trends for flash are secular in nature in multiple megamarkets for flash.
So certainly it has already been playing out that the increasing technology complexity, the greater capital investment that is required, the upcoming transition from 2D to 3D, and therefore considerations of ROI on any new capacity, all of this is playing a role in reduced levels of supply bit growth compared to the years past, while the demand trends really continue to be solid, if anything, continue to pick up momentum in the marketplace.
So these trends are translating into an industry environment that is significantly more healthy, more robust, than any time in the past. And SanDisk certainly is very much focused on making sure that we are really driving our supply toward the best mix of solutions and as part of that, we absolutely manage our pricing consideration with our customers, very closely, as I said. 
We want to make sure that for our valuable bits that we produce, and for the tremendous technology investment that we have, that we are getting the recognition of that from our customers in terms of pricing as well. I believe we are doing a good job, and we stay focused on continuing to improve the mix and allocate our supply with considerations of pricing and margin from our variety of customers and end markets, keeping that in mind.

Our final question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley 
For the last couple of quarters, youâve had this inventory drawdown, and yet revenues have been kind of in the middle of expectations. Has this been your plan going into the quarter, to draw down the inventory, or did something happen over the course of the quarter that they ended up coming down? And if you didnât expect to draw it down, then why didnât it drive some revenue upside?
Judy Bruner 
We have been planning to draw down inventory this year. In fact, I believe at the beginning of the year, I indicated that our revenue bit growth in 2014 could be greater than our supply bit growth, because we did expect to draw down inventory. 
And we have drawn it down, and credit goes also to the efficiency of our supply chain organization, which has made a number of improvements that have allowed us to draw down the inventory weeks of supply even as the mix of our business has moved more towards SSDs, which tend to have longer cycle times and hub requirements and so on.
So yes, weâve always planned, over the course of this year, to draw down inventory. But at this point, weâre operating at very lean levels of inventory, and thatâs whatâs creating pockets of supply constraint.  
Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley 
And then if I go back a few years ago, you guys used to buy a decent amount of non-captive product, because you have a lot of value-added segments, and you were able to get pretty good margin on that. As you see these constraints, have you entertained the idea of doing that again, more broadly?
Judy Bruner 
Well, we are, as we mentioned earlier, planning for 2015 to largely use non-captive for the Fusion-io based business, so clearly weâre trying to use non-captive there. Relative to the other commercial parts of our business, itâs difficult to use non-captive once you have worked with your customers to qualify the products on your own captive solution. You canât just suddenly switch over to a different product with them once youâve gone through qualification. 
So itâs very difficult in our commercial business. In our retail business, there our business is particularly well-suited for the leading edge X3 memory that weâre producing in our own fabs. So it is difficult to use non-captive outside of areas where we, for example, have done an acquisition, and itâs already on non-captive, and then we can keep it there.
