On behalf of Quintiles, hello, and welcome to today's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. My name is Henna, and I will be your web events specialist today. (Operator Instructions). 
It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan
Thank you, Henna. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles' Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Tom Pike
Thank you Karl good morning from snowy North Carolina. I would like to thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. I am proud to say that we accomplished what we set out to do in 2013 that's win significant new business and deliver with quality and innovation. 
Let's begin on slide three. 2013 was a great year of Quintiles as we reemerged as a public company in early May and achieved many milestones through the year; one of the most recent was our first billion dollar service revenue quarter in the company's history. We're pleased with both our quarterly results and our full year 2013 achievements and enter 2014 with a great deal of momentum. We continue to demonstrate our leadership and ability to execute operationally. 
We achieved a 13.2% increase in our backlog across the business to a record $9.9 billion. We have a book-to-bill across the business of 1.29 for the year very balanced with 1.29 in product development and 1.27 in integrated healthcare services. We have strong service revenue growth of over 10% in product development during the fourth quarter contributing to that first $1 billion service revenue quarter. 
We also continue to enhance our best in industry margins with 110 basis points improvement to our full year adjusted income from operations margin, and we delivered 28.7% growth in adjusted net income for the year, 18.6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year and 15% growth in free-cash flow for the year. 
Regarding the quarter it was solid. In product development we are the global leader in providing clinical services and we were selected by a couple of key customers to deepen our relationships resulting in some bookings but may be more importantly positioning us well for future quarters and years. 
Our book-to-bill ratio for the fourth quarter in product development was 1.24 and 1.29 overall for the year. Both of those are above our historical norms. Our strong net new business for the year allowed us to capture market share in terms of new business during this year. Regarding services revenues we achieved double-digit growth in the quarter as projects began to transition out of the start-up phase. 
Our adjusted income from operations in this segment was strong at 19.7% with improved margins over the same quarter last year. Perhaps more importantly though we have some of the best customer relationships in the industry, increasingly our customers have us work with them side-by-side on designing trials and improving efficiency. 
During this quarter we saw many leading pharmaceutical firms reexamining their development practices and we are there helping them to see the probability of success. 
Regarding Integrated Healthcare Services I am pleased to report that we are continuing our transformation. We had another strong quarter of net new business with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.47 for the quarter, leaving us at 1.27 for the year. These are both well above our historical norms. Within this segment our late phase business remains a leader with strong new business wins this year. 
One exciting thing is the synergy between our commercial and clinical groups. For instance, last week I met with nurse educators who work with investigators during the clinical trial process for one compound and they are now rolling into the commercial organization for product launch. This is merely one example of our evolving Product Development and Integrated Healthcare Services interconnected evidence based delivery model. 
We continue to deliver innovative solutions for our customers across both of our segments which underpins our ability to generate strong new business as demonstrated in 2013. We finished the year strong in both segments, have nice momentum as we enter 2014. We believe 2014 should be a stronger year in terms of revenue growth along with our best-in-class margins.
Now let me handover to Kevin who will provide greater detail on our financial results. 
Kevin Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning to everyone joining today. Letâs start on slide four and begin with the consolidated results. For the quarter ended December 31, 2013 our consolidated service revenues grew 7.7% compared to the prior year quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which we refer to as constant currency growth. At actual foreign exchange rates our service revenues grew 6.2% to $1 billion in the quarter. 
For the year our constant currency revenue growth was 5.1% compared to the same period in 2012. At actual foreign exchange rates our service revenues grew 3.1% to $3.8 billion. The 2013 full year numbers at actual rates were negatively impacted by 2% from foreign currency or approximately $70.6 million. The global diversification of our service revenues remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year, Northern Latin America region, 40%; the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, 39%; and the Asia-Pacific region 21% of the total consolidated revenues. 
For the fourth quarter adjusted SG&A of $232.8 million was 23.2% of service revenues compared to $202.6 million in the prior year or 21.4% of services revenues. The increase was primarily due to organic growth related costs, including employee compensation, $10.4 million from the Novella acquisition including purchase accounting cost, $10 million in cost recorded in connection with global overhead leverage programs aimed at lowering overall costs and executive separation cost of $5.3 million which were partially offset by lower share-based compensation of approximately $9 million. 
During the fourth quarter adjusted income from operations grew 12.8% to $129.2 million, and generated a margin of 12.9%. Compared to the same period last year the margin increased 80 basis points as a result of productivity improvements, service mix and positive foreign exchange impact, offset by the increase in SG&A cost noted earlier. 
For the full year adjusted income from operations was $504.1 million, representing growth of 13.2%. The income from operations margin for the year was also 13.2%, representing 110 basis points of margin improvement. Including a 70 basis point benefit from foreign exchange the GAAP effective income tax rate was 27.5% during the quarter compared to 36.3% for the same period last and 29.7% compared to 34.9% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 respectively. 
The current year effective income tax rates were positively impacted by a change in income tax accounting resulting from the change in assertion to permanently reinvest our earnings in most foreign jurisdictions. 
Adjusted net income grew 58.2% to $76.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. For the year, our adjusted net income was $268.9 million representing growth of 28.7%. Contributing to the adjusted net income growth were the improved operating margins, reduction in the current year effective income tax rate and reduced interest expense due to lower interest rates and reduced debt levels resulting from the $350 million debt repayment from the net IPO proceeds. 
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 41.5% to $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.41 per share in the prior year quarter and for the year the diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $2.10 per share compared with $1.77 per share in 2012. 2013 periods were impacted by additional shares issues and the IPO. 
We recognized $2.2 million of net restructuring charges during the fourth quarter and $14.1 million for the year in connection with approved restructuring plans. Our Board also approved up to an addition of $13 million for restructuring to improve alignment of our resources. We expect to incur cost under these plans through their completion in 2014. 
Our cash balance was $778 million as of the end of year of which $320 million was in the U.S. compared to $568 million of total cash at the end of 2012. Cash flow from operations was $397.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $335.7 million for the same period in 2012. The increase in operating cash flow reflects the increase in net income, lower payments of income taxes of approximately $33 million and lower interest payment of $11.6 million. These increases were offset by $32.5 million of cash payments during the second quarter as related to the termination or amendment of certain agreements with affiliates and the debt repayment. 
In addition our dayâs sales outstanding increased five days as compared to the end of 2012, but notably improved four days compared to the third quarter of 2013. Capital expenditures were $92.3 million for the year or 2.4% of service revenue compared to $71.3 million during the same period in 2012. Free cash flow for the year increased 15% compared to the same period in the prior year to $305 million.
Our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt in capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at December 31, 2013 was $1.27 billion compared to $1.85 billion at the end of 2012. 
During the fourth quarter the company repurchased approximately 153,000 shares of its common stock in the open market and 2 million of vested in-the-money employee stock options for an aggregate purchase price of $65.5 million as authorized under the October 2013 equity repurchase program. As of December 31, 2013, $59.5 million of authorization remains available under the program.
Now turning to the segments please turn to slide five, our Product Development segment accounted for 77% of our service revenues while the IHS segment accounted for 23% for the year, a 3% greater percentage from the Product Development compared with 2012. Product Development constant currency revenue growth was 10.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. At actual foreign exchange rates Product Development Service revenue grew 10.2% to $775 million. 
For the year Product Developments constant currency revenue grew 7.9% and at actual foreign exchange rate 7% to $2.9 billion which included a negative impact from foreign exchange of $23.6 million. Novella contributed $36.5 million to revenues since its acquisition in mid-September. 
Fourth quarter Service revenue growth was from net volume increase in clinical services, primarily in the Americas and Europe contribution from Novella and volume increases in our global lab business offset by the wind down of both a large clinical project and a large consulting services rescue project. 
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $152.9 million, 21.9% growth at actual rates and 15.1% at constant currency rates. Product Development income from operations margin was 19.7% in the quarter representing an improvement of 190 basis points compared to same period last year, benefiting from increased productivity from the leveraging of our IT platforms and global infrastructure our cost improvement programs and positive foreign exchange offset by increased SG&A principally in connection with the Novella acquisition and the cost recorded associated with the global overhead leverage programs. 
For the year Product Development's constant-currency income from operations growth was 12.7% and at actual foreign exchange rates 17.7% increasing to $562.3 million which included a positive foreign exchange impact of $24 million. The income from operations margin for the year finished at 19.3% representing 180 basis points of margin improvement. 
Moving to HIS, the IHS service revenues of $228.9 million declined 1.1% or $2.6 million at constant currency rates in the fourth quarter. At actual foreign exchange rate service revenues declined 5.7% or $13.9 million compared to the same period last year. 
For the year IHS' constant currency revenue declined 2.9% and at actual foreign exchange rate was down 7.8% to $888.6 million which included a negative foreign exchange impact of $47 million. Service revenues for the fourth quarter and full year in the IHS segment were impacted by no new business wins in the first half of 2013 and negative scope modifications and cancellations from fourth quarter 2012 and second quarter 2013 partially offset by revenue growth in excess of 20% from our laid base unit. 
IHS income from operations for the fourth quarter was $11.7 million, down 4.1% at constant currency rates and 13.8% at actual foreign exchange compared to the same period in 2012. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 5.1% at actual foreign exchange rates and was negatively impacted by 50 basis points of foreign exchange. 
For the year IHS constant currency income from operations of $42.1 million was a year-on-year decline of 19.9% and at actual foreign exchange rate was down 30.4% which included negative foreign exchange impact of $6.3 million. The income from operations margin for the year finished at 5.2% at constant currency rates and 4.7% at actual rates. 
To conclude in summary our fourth quarter results continue the trend of solid performance and product development with a good service revenue growth offset by reaching the final stages of a couple of large projects winding down, improved contributions in operating margins and a record level of backlog. 
IHS faced revenue challenges throughout 2013 including being hampered by foreign exchange headwinds. However, it's beginning to turn the corner back to revenue growth with strong new business wins. This segment has had two sequential quarters of very strong book-to-bill ratios that resulted in a full year book-to-bill of 1.27 which is the highest we've recorded in over five years. 
Now turning to our 2014 guidance, with a strong net new business and book-to-bill ratios recorded in both segments we entered 2014 with $9.9 billion of backlog. We expect to recognize approximately $3.5 billion of backlog as revenue in 2014 and with the expected continued strength in new business we expect to achieve service revenues between $4.09 billion and $4.15 billion representing constant currency growth between 7.4% and 9%. 
Our revenue estimate includes the negative impact from the wind down of the large clinical and consulting projects, now essentially complete which we estimate as a 390 basis point revenue growth headwind. We also expect to achieve diluted adjusted earnings per share between $2.33 and $2.46 per share representing growth of 11% to 17% and diluted GAAP earnings per share between of $2.26 and $2.40 per share. 
We expect the annual effective income tax rate to be similar to 2013 at approximately 30%. Our financial guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the beginning of this year but does not reflect the potential impact of future equity repurchases if any. We expect 2014 to be another strong year of growth for the company. 
And with that I'll turn it back to Tom. 
Tom Pike
Thank you, Kevin. From our guidance you can see that we're well positioned. Let me take a moment and reflect on the past year and then letâs get some insight into 2014. 
Quintiles just completed its 32nd year in early February. We are the leader in biopharmaceutical services with nearly $4 billion in revenue. In 2013 we decided to reenter the public markets and completed our IPO on May 9th. We felt that weâd be attractive to the public investor based on our attractive market with 6% to 8% intrinsic growth, our leadership position in both segments and our industry leading margins which are based both on our competitive advantages as well as our attractive mix of businesses. 
Perhaps most importantly compared to other industries and companies we have forward looking visibility with our backlog which is about 2.5 times our service revenues. I am very pleased and proud of our teamâs performance during this year. Our 1.29 book-to-bill is a six year high and of course itâs a much larger absolute number than it was six years ago.
Our Product Development revenue growth hit double digits in the fourth quarter after three solid quarters of achievements and our profitability and EPS growth has been strong. As we enter 2014 we continue to see strong record RFP volumes in Product Development and very good opportunities in IHS. We believe we have the strongest customer relationship management team and sales team in the industry and that may allow us to see more than others but what we do see in terms of our pipeline we are very pleased with. We see growth in large, mid-size and small biopharma. 
During the year we won a number of key opportunities and really redefined the industryâs view of a strategic partnership. Our strategic partnership is now much more than preferred resourcing. Itâs using the breadth and depth of our capabilities to improve efficiency and increase the customerâs probability of success. We have a capacity for more of them giving Quintiles robust opportunities to drive above market growth today and in the future. 
We are known as the innovation leader and we continue to focus on how to bring a unique and powerful combination of insights and superior delivery capabilities for better outcomes to every relationship whether itâs big or it's small. This deepens our relationships and allows us to increase the addressable market.
We have the scale to make investments in key areas that others in our industry don't. We now have over 950 doctors and 900 PhDs and will continue to hire talent that is helpful to our customers. With the advent of precision or personalized medicine with risk-based monitoring, with adaptive trials, expertise is critical for our customers to be successful. Weâre the leaders in the creation and interaction of technology with people and process to deliver results in clinical development. 
Our technology has won multiple awards this year including very importantly in the current environment a security award. Thereâs simply no other company that has the technology, understands the business and therapeutic requirements for success, and has the right people globally to execute better against complex protocols, emerging areas like risk-based monitoring and adaptive trials. We have the first mover advantage and we need to continue to capitalize on it.
Weâre about more than the top line here at Quintiles. We are driving what I've come to call global best services industry practices in quality, delivery and productivity. What this is, is best practices not just from our industry but looking at other global services industries to help us both effectiveness and efficiency in terms of how we manage our business and how we deliver for customers. You can see the results in our margins. 
As mentioned previously we expanded our industry leading adjusted income from operations margin in 2013 while focusing on quality and the patients enrolled in our clinical studies. We are focused on further leveraging our global infrastructure to benefit our customers with most efficient processes. 
We won a number of awards during this year that validate our commitment to quality. For example, in 2013 we won the CRO Eagle Award that reflects the opinions more than a thousand investigator sites across the globe. We were also identified as preferred CRO for late stage clinical development by the 2013 William Blair survey and preferred Phase I service provider in ISRâs 2013 phase I survey. 
Our accomplishments during 2013 have made us stronger and better positioned and weâll maintain our leadership position in the industry while we are supporting the evolving needs of our customers. With these advantages and strong net new business from 2013 we move into 2014 in a position of strength. 
Weâre number one in clinical services, we are growing our number two position in lab services, we are the largest provider of commercialization services, we have an industry leading capability and real world late phase services. I also believe we have the best management team in the business which allows us to manage this complex global business at a very detailed level. Our guidance is based on organic growth. However we continue to look at accretive capability building acquisitions. And we will certainly work to optimize our balance sheet. 
In closing I would like to recognize and thank the entire Quintiles' team now over 28,000 strong for their innovation hard work and commitment. We're pleased with our solid 2013 achievements and financial results and enter this year with a solid platform for future growth in both of our segments in 2014 and beyond. 
Now let me turn the call back to Karl to begin the question-and-answer.
Karl Deonanan 
Thanks, Tom. We are ready to take questions. I would ask all participants to limit their questions to two to allow as many participants to ask questions. Henna you may now open the call for questions.

Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell. 
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.
Thanks, nice finish to the year and start to '14. My question is on Integrated Healthcare Services great finish to the year with bookings, but given the volatility through the year on the book-to-bill it would be really helpful if we could get some sense of the phasing of revenue as we move into '14, i.e. are there any abnormalities regarding the burn rates or the duration of these contracts? 
And then as my follow up to that I am just curious 1.8 book-to-bill in the second half often that means some pretty heavy investments in staffing. Should we be thinking about a margin profile that starts a little lighter in the first half and get stronger in the second half as those contracts come online? So any color on IHS will be great. Thank you. 
Kevin Gordon

Sure thanks Eric. This is Kevin. With respect to those bookings in the second half I think we actually made investments in the fourth quarter with respect to IHS and ramping up some of the headcount. So you see actually some of that reflected through the margin profile in the fourth quarter as a couple of those large contracts that we won actually really began ramping up revenue as we start into 2014. 
So I think you will see that segment return to growth but your question is right we will see revenues ramp as we go through the year. And I would say not necessarily just limiting that to HIS, we would expect that to occur fully across the portfolio. So as you look at the guidance that we provided first quarter margins would tend to be a bit lower from the seasonality perspective for our business as a result of restarting benefit costs from beginning of the year and so forth. 
So I think if you look back first quarter tends to be lower. As we go through the year you will expect to see that improve. 
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.
And then if I could just in IHS sticking with that segment, obviously doing very well with the delayed phase programs but could you give us some sense on what you are seeing on the detailing side of the business. Just curious if you are seeing pharmas come back with greater outsourcing opportunities with the slight uptick we're seeing globally on new molecule approvals? Thank you and I will leave it with that. 
Tom Pike
Eric it's Tom. Yeah we are seeing that, in fact I think the pipeline there is in fact up from same time last year and it's up pretty significantly from same time last year. I do want to be a little cautious because as you said in the beginning Eric this is a bit of a lumpy business. So in terms of exact timing of net new business tends to be a little lumpier than product development for instance. 
But we are having discussions at very high levels as well as tactical discussions about verbalizing sales force and there is a recognition among the customers that in fact using the commercial services is actually as productive and often when you take overhead cost into account much more efficient than doing it in-house. 
And so as over the last several years I think most folks in the industry know that it's been difficult to predict sales in the early stages and this really gives you the ability to flex up or down without making long-term commitment to staff. The other thing that's an interesting by-product of the new product launches is that we are seeing a little more interest in terms of us helping with mature products. 
And so sometimes the requests are around the new product launches which we've done. We're truly an industry leader in terms of the one, the products that we've launched over the last decade. But then we're also starting to get more interest in supplementing on the mature products so that they can move some of their key reps into the new product areas. 
So I think we do feel good. But I will warn you itâs going to be a little lumpy on that side. Maybe quickly on the observation on late phase clearly there is a broad recognition in our discussions about the importance of late phase and observational studies. And I was in customer meeting is just during this week in fact where we have been talking to medical affairs folks about how this is just a growing TP, sort of the relationship that they are building with their investigators and the idea of really having a franchise in terms of a particular therapeutic area. 
So I think on that side of the house we feel like weâre very well positioned as well. So long answer Eric but itâs important area for us. So thank you. 
Eric Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co.
No, thatâs great. Thanks very much.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken.
Ross Muken â ISI Group

Congrats. 
Kevin Gordon

Thank you, Ross.
Ross Muken â ISI Group

Just in terms of maybe the new business environment on the PD side, maybe you could just give us a little color maybe by market segment whether you sort of will look at it sort of small versus large pharma biotech kind of what you are seeing in terms of RFP activity and hit rate and how you are seeing maybe things sequentially change as well?
Tom Pike

Yeah let me Ross, this is Tom. Ross I will start on that and then Kevin can chime in as well. We are seeing a good spread across the different sizes of customers. So if you look at the actual -- let me start with I guess the pipeline itself. If you look at it versus last year at the same time we had very significant year-on-year growth in terms of our going forward pipeline and it definitely is the largest itâs been in the last 12 quarters. 
Now that being said again the sales can be a little lumpy and the pipeline maybe spread across multiple quarters. So thatâs not a single quarter thing but I think in light of some of the things you read in the newspapers about the major pharmaceutical firms we feel very good about the pipeline. 
The other thing that I would add and I mentioned in my comments before is just that I do think our sales organization is quite powerful so we may see more than others in our customer relationships but that being said the size of the pipeline is significantly larger than last year. 
In terms of how itâs made up you know you look across our sales for this year and we had more than 50% of our new business from outside of top 20 pharma. So you generally are seeing a spread from large pharma, mid-pharma, small pharma in terms of what that pipeline is and itâs pretty balanced right now across those segments as evidenced by our net new business success.
Ross Muken â ISI Group
And just is there any bias sort of from a geographic basis in terms of where you are seeing incremental activity. I am just only curious because of all the biotech activity in terms of equity fund raising in the U.S. seems like that continues to be robust and then obviously there has been a lot of noise in some of the emerging markets so I am just curious if there is any delta on either of those sub segments. 
Tom Pike
No, not really. We are not seeing a particular spike thatâs visible. You know itâs interesting as we just a little color because you look at some of the Western Europe firms looking at licensing product et cetera so it can be difficult to tell exactly where the finances ultimately will come from even though the raises are taking place. 
We do feel good though about Asia-Pacific. I think that we continue to grow at above market rates in Asia-Pacific and it continues to be an area particularly in places like Japan where clearly itâs one of the most attractive markets for pharmaceuticals based in a way they are supporting innovative drug development. And so I think I was just talking to a leader of Asia last night and I think our outlook on countries where the government continues to support innovation if you look at that Asia-Pacific clearly is a medium and long term growth opportunities that will probably grow at a rate above the growth rate of the rest of the world. 
Ross Muken â ISI Group

Great. Thank you for your color.
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Tejas Savant.
Tejas Savant - JPMorgan

Yes, standing in for Tycho this morning. Can you give us a little bit of color in terms of cancellations earlier in the year and the degree to which they impacted revenues in IHS for the quarter?
Kevin Gordon

Yeah, I think in my remarks I think not only this quarter but previous quarters I think we talked more about the cancellations that actually occurred or scope modifications that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. We did have cancellations in the second quarter, obviously had somewhat of an impact on HIS as well. But as we exit 2013 the impact of those are behind us. And as I mentioned we expect as we go into 2014 we will actually see IHS segment now returning to revenue growth and the impact of those is behind us as I said.
Tejas Savant - JPMorgan
Okay, then can you also give us a quick update on the Novella acquisition and your capital deployment priorities for 2014?
Kevin Gordon
Sure, I think as you heard Novella since we acquired it in mid-September add revenue contributions to the fourth quarters. Net total contribution over the period was about $36.5 million of revenue. It were accretive contribution to earnings although minor, it did contribute to the earnings in the fourth quarter, slightly given the impact of the purchasing accounting impacts obviously the company has certainly delivered on profitability but that amortization somewhat offsets to make that contribution minor. 
As far as new business I would say they are contributing at a similar level into the Product Development, new business contribution, so very much in line with the expectations that we set coming into the acquisition. As far as capital deployment I think weâve been pretty consistent about our desire to continue to invest in growth whether be organically or inorganically through acquisitions. 
Tom mentioned in his remarks we continue to look at acquisitions that are capability building or capability enhancing to our portfolio. We expect to add to earnings or an annualized earnings rate about 2% to 3% through inorganic activities which is very much in line with what you saw with the Novella acquisition. And then certainly you saw us put a smaller purchase program in place back in November and we will always continue to look at opportunities from a shareholder perspective and our board to the extent they decide our would consider alternatives that may enhance that we would also consider that to the extent thatâs an appropriate decision for shareholders.
Tom Pike
Just one quick thing on Novella, this is Tom, I think, I think we are just very pleased overall. We are pleased with the leadership team, we are pleased with their reputation with customers and as Kevin said the financial performance has been solid essentially right in line with the rest of our business which has been solid as well.
Tejas Savant - JPMorgan
Thanks, guys.
Tom Pike
Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao.
Tom Pike
Morning, Doug. 
Karl Deonanan 
Okay, operator, let's go to the next question and we can come back to Doug later.
Operator

Okay, one moment please, Mr. Tsao, your line is open.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays
Hello.
Tom Pike
Hi, Doug.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays
Can you hear me now?
Tom Pike
Yeah.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays
Okay, good morning.
Tom Pike
Doug, it was like you were on a radio program and you were trying to hear yourself.
Douglas Tsao - Barclays
You know, Tom, just maybe provide some comments a little bit expand on just what you just were talking about the demand you are seeing from Asia. I was just curious if you could provide a bit more color in terms of how you are seeing the trend in the business right now in Asia ex-Japan and how you feel in terms of your relative scale and where the maturity of that business is overall from a possibility standpoint.
Tom Pike
Yeah, I made a few comments, you know, in spirit of candor I think we see what I might call Northeast Asia -- North Asia a little different than South Asia. North Asia which will be countries like China, Korea and Japan you continue to see a very high level of demand, our growth rates there are at the highest of our company in a couple of those markets Iâve mentioned. 
And then South East Asia and I talked of some of the pharmaceutical executives about this, probably not as strong to be perfectly honest with you. We donât know if it is a trend yet but there is just the ebbs and flows of the industry. But I think you know the transformation is starting to take place in China. I was just there recently and the transformation started to take place where you have got a combination of global multinationals with significant R&D headcount merging into China. 
The burden of disease that's taking place and then the governmental support it does yield an environment where we think there is going to be a lot activity over the next number of years. And you certainly see that in China, Korea, Japan the strongest. And so I think we are pretty -- we are very bullish. In fact we just continue to think about how we can work more effectively globally and support both the multinationals and local players, and then how we can work with the local players and drive net new business there. So does that help, Doug?
Douglas Tsao - Barclays
Yeah, no, that's great color. And then in terms of what you have seen -- you are seeing right now in HIS, obviously you had another very good quarter in terms of in terms of bookings, things certainly seem to be much more stable there. Is this a function of just simply macros trends that are taking place in the market or do you attribute this to some extent to sort of your growth and market approach having changed at all? 
Tom Pike
Yeah I do think that the change in approach has helped. And what we are really bringing now is we are certainly answering the mail of a pharmaceutical firm has a request for an RFP, we certainly answer those. But our team is doing a great job of being proactive and trying to think about solutions for customers and trying really drive -- talk about how we can drive the productivity, how we can affect the launch, where we can we pulse the launch a little bit give it more power and just make sure we are maximizing things. 
And so I think our team is just doing a great job in terms of this transition to more of a solution that's outcome oriented. The other thing we have done here is we have spent more time putting our strong consulting team together with the commercial team to try to make sure again the customer is getting the maximum amount of value from our company. And really trying to make sure that we are bringing better solutions that they might come up with on their own. 
So I do think a lot of it's a value proposition. If we look at some of the big wins it's a value proposition. One of the big wins interestingly a global win was very important just the breadth of our customer relationships. We ended up with Connexxions, here in the U.S., Connexxions in Japan, there was that combination of relationships that result made it go. So I do think the power of Quintiles is working in IHS. And we are excited. 
We've brought in a new leader Scott Evangelista joins us from Deloitte. He was a leader of their commercial consulting practice and he lives commercial transformation every day. And he is having an impact right away, has a deep view of what pharmaceutical firms need in that area and I think is really helping supercharge us.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley. 
David H. Windley â Jefferies & Co.
Thanks for taking the questions and my congratulations on your first year result. I wanted to focus on margin. You were in particularly Product Development margin I think you have been able to deliver expansion there to maybe a greater degree than you had expected or that you had led us to expect. And I believe if I look at your guidance that it also seems to anticipate that you will get some margin. And I wondered if that's also in product development or if you could talk to us about where you expect get that operating leverage? That will be great, thanks. 
Kevin Gordon

Sure I apologize for the coughing suffering little bit of a cold here, so my apologies to everybody listening. Dave I think you are right, we continue to see strength in the margins particularly in product development. I think HIS has continued out long at about the rate that we had expected in that mid-single-digit area. 
Product development margins have been strong. We saw contributions margin again strong as we've mentioned a couple of times. I think we've benefited from foreign currency impact there that's contributed to the margins this year. But as we look forward to our guidance and in that guidance is our margins I think from a contribution level that are very similar to this year's margins. And to the extent that there is some level of contribution beyond that, you heard in our remarks about leveraging cost programs around SG&A and other areas that we would expect to actually potentially get a little bit more benefit from as you look through the bottom line in the guidance. 
Tom Pike
And so on that last comment Kevin thatâs kind of pointing toward the corporate line. I should we think about those manifesting in the corporate lines is that correct? 
Kevin Gordon
I think it's a little bit -- it's actually from an SG&A level goes across more so product development and corporate but across the business. 
David H. Windley â Jefferies & Co.
Okay. But just for the final point on it I mean your EPS target at the mid-point do you set a growth trajectory that is greater than revenue. So you are expecting some amount of leverage in the model yes, am I reading that correctly I just want to make sure I am understanding the guidance?
Kevin Gordon 
We are certainly looking at leverage across the model we're also looking at lower interest expense that's contributing to the EPS as well, Dave. 
David H. Windley â Jefferies & Co.
 Okay.
Kevin Gordon
As you saw we did again we took down our debt with the repayments. We also re-priced our debt again in December I think that you saw which will contribute about $6 million of pretax benefit to next year. So there is leverage in the operating model and there is also some contribution below the line. 
David H. Windley â Jefferies & Co.
Got it and a follow-up question then could you give us an update on the number of very large clients or developments around very large strategies, you mentioned I think one at least but you've in the past I think talked to us about 10 clients greater than 100 million, two or three greater than 200 million can you give us some perspective on of size at the top? 
Kevin Gordon 
Yeah it's actually pretty consistent with what we talked about in the past and if we continue we haven't lost any customers in that, so we continue to grow. It's interesting about us Dave, we were talking about this the other days we're preparing is we just continue to have this diversity, no customer greater than 10%.
It helps us to absorb cancellations. We try to be diverse in terms of therapeutic area as well. We're diverse globally. We continue to have the large clients who support us. So the relationship is strong. In terms of the two I mentioned in my remarks we had a couple of core customers select us to go deeper essentially in the relationship. And in general we donât expose, we try, we really feel like we're in many ways a little pre-competitive in the industry. We can work with a lot of people because of our expertise and help them be more successful. 
So we generally don't expose those customer names as part of what we do. But two have asked us to go deeper. It will result in us taking some work from some of our competition in those cases. And so we're excited about those. And frankly we continue to work on these types of either source or strategic relationships as we go into this year we have an internal initiative to do it. 
So I hope that gives you a little color. We don't go too deep because we don't want to talk about customers too directly for perhaps obvious reasons. 
David H. Windley â Jefferies & Co.
Sure thanks appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of George Hill. 
Kevin Gordon
Hi, George. 
Operator
George your line is open.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank
Can you guys can you hear me okay?
Kevin Gordon
Yes. 
George Hill - Deutsche Bank
Okay. You can hear me now. Good morning, first of all I will say good morning and congrats on the first year out and strong results. I guess kind of question is [inaudible] product I guess can you talk about demand that you are seeing there and competitive environment just to some of the independent vendors you may be posting pretty good results and we're seeing other kind of companies of all size try to approach clinical research technology space so may just some comments there and I guess what you are seeing close out versus the core customers versus anybody who is not like a [P def 09] test customer? 
Tom Pike
Yeah let me share a few comments and Kevin can contribute. We do view technology as being really critical to our industry and one of the analogies I often make George is that if you look at payroll now you would never think about developing your own payroll system and having ATP run your process for you. ATP brings the payroll system.
And I think in many ways our industry is moving in that direction in certain areas. Our software is very complementary in that to the Oracle suite and the Medidata suite in particular but really can be adapted to virtually anything because itâs been designed from the data structures and so we have a good relationship with Medi, we have a good relationship with Oracle and Infosario actually lets us manage projects more effectively, lets us do risk based monitoring. 
Weâre the only ones to have remote monitoring in low cost countries. Itâs based on our workflow processes and Infosario tool and it frankly complements a lot of whatâs out there. Just to give you some statistics for instance we have more than doubled the number of investigator site users that are on our Infosario tool in the past year and weâre continuing to -- I think our number of accounts is well over 60,000 company -- I am sorry, individuals and accounts that use the system now. 
So itâs really become a core part of our business and what weâre starting to do is look at not just monitoring risk based trials or particular trial s but actually monitoring all our trials from that centralized control center. So we think itâs complementary to what you see from the technology providers. We work closely with them. The difference for us by the way is just that what we bring is the therapeutic and statistical expertise. 
So when it comes to an area like risk-based monitoring or adaptive trials we bring that deep expertise that lets us create the technology tools to support the evolution of the industry. Others have to bring that expertise in to developerâs tools and so I think thatâs our power. Does that help George?
George Hill â Deutsche Bank
No, thatâs very helpful and kind of like slew of numbers and quantification so that was great color and then maybe just a brief follow up. It looks like we could be starting to see some reacceleration of the preclinical and very early stage market. I guess could you talk about how you guys are feeling positioned in that market, which kind of segments you want to stay exposed to and I guess as we think about M&A thatâs something you might go extra far. 
Tom Pike
But you know that I think you probably know George from our prior discussions that we are focused on the clinical portion so weâre really focused on first demand through the practice of medicine in the marketplace and commercialization and practice in medicine. At this stage and interesting I was in a discussion with s customer about exactly this earlier. 
There is so much evolution going on in the preclinical model and so much challenge to the animal base models that are taking place in lot of the industry, we were having a discussion earlier about how we take the CNS area and you take animal -- earlier this week you take the CNS area and you take animal models and there is just a big question about exactly what role the animal model plays. 
And so for us we see plenty of business. You We see a $93 billion market, we see about 19 billion of it outsourced today, we see potential addressable market increases that are pretty significant just in the market that we serve which is the clinical portion and what we will do is we will continue through bio analytical services and genetic testing, RNA sequencing, weâll continue to have on ramps from preclinical into clinical to scientific on ramps as part of our business. But for us we think there is plenty of opportunity in the clinical phases. Our early stage our Phase I business is actually improving, so supporting some of these trends. 
We don't put it together specifically but for instance our occupancy in facilities is up and you know that business in terms of our P flow is quite robust. So I think you do see that trend there but I think it will be better to go to some of the guys who focus in preclinical to get the real trends. 
George Hill â Deutsche Bank
Makes sense, I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Tom Pike

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities
I wanted to get a little bit of perspective on your revenue growth versus your book-to-bill and what the math I am doing here is basically trying to get at your organic constant currency growth rate. If I strip out both Novella and the foreign exchange from 2013 it looks like your organic constant currency growth would have been between 3.5% and 4% and thatâs obviously below the growth rate that you expect for your market. And then if I perform that same exercise on your guidance for 2014 at the midpoint it's looking like organic constant currency growth is going to between 5.5% and 6% again kind of below your market growth and all of this comes on top of really, really strong bookings last year. 
And looks like you are well positioned going into 2014. So I am trying to get a sense for whether your guidance is a little bit conservative or may be whether you are expecting the backlog conversion to decline meaningfully again in 2014 any sort of color there you can give me on that kind of perspective it would be great. Thank you. 
Kevin Gordon
I would say I think your math or your ranges that you gave they are probably pretty close. I would point out though again as I did in my remarks that we have a very large trial winding down, we have a consulting project that was kind of a one large rescue project and those two things alone, that large clinical project was the largest project the company's run in its history, those two things combined were about 390 basis points headwind to our revenue growth in 2014 guidance. So in this coming year in 2014 guidance so you are looking at your 6%, 6 plus percent revenue growth number that you are suggesting from organic which is probably pretty close with 390 basis point headwind from those I think is some of the pressure but backlog at $9.9 billion is very strong. 
I think our burn rate with that in mind in terms of the impact from those particular things coming down, the burn rate remains actually pretty strong and pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. We just are deploying what we need to, this thing winding down we'll alleviate coming out in '14. 
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities
Would you be expecting to be able to do book-to-bill of about 1.2 pretty consistently in [TDEF] on a trailing 12 month basis?
Kevin Gordon
 Well I would just point you to the last five years. In the last five years it averages 1.23 and in the last five years and 2012 and as a company 1.23 and 2013 was 1.29 for product development. So I would say based on historical trends, I mean in future I guess I can be like my investment advisor saying historical trends never predict the future but I guess we've had six consecutive years over 1.2. 
So we feel pretty good about where we've come from that we feel really strong about the pipeline that we have in front of us and we're seeing RFP volumes up so I think the trends in the industry are positive in that direction. 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bailin.
Jeff Bailin - Credit Suisse
 
Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin may be given the strong bookings performance that you just discussed in 2013, particularly on the product development side and some of those projects you have winding down. Can you talk a little bit about how the company is thinking about resources and staffing levels for 2014 and may be what that might mean for kind of the margin profile on that business? 
Kevin Gordon
Yeah well certainly whatever our expectations are built into that guidance, so we've done I think a very good job on management team particularly in product development as these projects have would down redeploying those resources effectively to support the backlog in the new start-up of projects that are starting up, because obviously something that is -- some of those resources are shifting over on to the new project. So a number of them are well into their start-up phase but as we continue to book new business we'll continue to hire at the appropriate rate. 
I think with the scale I think Tom mentioned this earlier with the scale that we have in the business in the geographic regions that we have, we have the ability to redeploy those resources effectively. So we hire very large numbers of people over the course of any year. And we would expect that we'll be able to successfully do that to support the new business growth that we have going forward. 
Jeff Bailin - Credit Suisse
 
Sure may be just shifting gears for a follow-up Tom you mentioned some growing strength in '13 in the central lab business could you just talk a little bit the company's momentum there and just any general sense on kind of this trajectory with that in 2014 and beyond?
Tom Pike
Our lab business in terms of new business is generally consistent with the book-to-bill that you see here. And as you know we don't break it out but this is a real area of focus for us. So we believe that this market is growing by a couple of percent and the underlying dynamics are causing the organizations that have scale to be able to capture more share. 
And the reason for that is obviously the investment in book print, the investment in equipment the globality becomes more and more critical as clinical trials have more complex procedures and testing. I think the numbers bounce around but something like 40% of the trials are anticipated to have a biomarker as part of them you are seeing that complexity and I don't think every lab is going to be able to offer the types of services that are required in the environment.
So we actually do feel good about our lab. I often say we're number two and we trying harder. So I heard that somewhere and it sounds good for us. So we're excited about that as we go forward. 
Jeff Bailin - Credit Suisse
 
Great, thanks for the questions. 
Tom Pike
All right I think we're about out of time unfortunately. I will say I think we feel really great about the year that we've had, coming public some strong results and going in 2014 the opportunity to take this historic book-to-bill for us turn that into revenue and then to continue to drive the new business based on the pipeline that we see. 
Thank you for joining us on the call. And we look forward to the next one. I think we're going to work every day to improve the probability of success of our customers and deliver better healthcare outcomes. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
