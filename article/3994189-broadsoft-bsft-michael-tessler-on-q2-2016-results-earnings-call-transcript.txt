Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the BroadSoft Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Martin, Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.
Chris Martin - Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss BroadSoft's results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.

With me on today's call are Michael Tessler, BroadSoft's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Tholen, BroadSoft's Chief Financial Officer.

I will now turn the call over to BroadSoft's President and CEO, Michael Tessler. Mike?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for taking the time to discuss our second quarter 2016 results. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong Q2 with revenue growth of 27% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings growth of over 50%. As usual, Jim will provide you with additional details on our financial results later in the call. I wanted to lead off my remarks with the exciting news that AT&T has selected BroadSoft to power its new Collaborate service. There are two key attributes to this service that make it noteworthy for both AT&T and us. The first is the nature of the offering itself. Collaborate is exciting new cloud-based enterprise communication solution that provides voice and collaboration capabilities across a variety of fixed and mobile devices, all using a single phone number.
The collaboration experience it enables is a very rich one, which includes the full gamut of our Unified Communications capabilities; voice, video, business directories, call logs, instant messaging and presence, conferencing and screen sharing are all available on a single application.
Secondly, over the last two years, AT&T has been open about its software-defined network transformation, also known as its Domain 2.0 initiative and Collaborate is part of this initiative. AT&T is at the vanguard of service providers transforming their networks to be much more nimble and lowering operational costs by leveraging IP, virtualization and software-defined architectures. AT&T is blazing a network path other service providers around the world will need to emulate and we're extremely happy to be a strategic partner to AT&T in this endeavor.
We're also happy to announce another great transformation win in Q2 with a North American service provider who will be migrating more than 100,000 business users off an existing, first-generation of voice over IP platform on to a BroadSoft-based UC solution. We've been a trusted partner of theirs for several years and supported their voice and UC efforts and look forward to strengthening our relationship as they continue to invest in and grow those businesses.
Now, I'll take a few minutes to update you on our progress against the few of our strategic objectives. First, continued innovation. As you recall, last year, we announced our Project Tempo initiative, our vision for the future of work. Its goal is to significantly improve employee productivity through more effective communication and collaboration.
We continue to innovate around Project Tempo and our recent acquisition of Intellinote, which has developed a great team collaboration product, is extremely complementary to that vision. This solution enables teams to work more effectively through messaging, file sharing, task management and integration with more than 50 third-party applications, including salesforce.com.
We'll continue to sell team collaboration as a standalone product through its current self-service, online model, but for us, the real meaningful opportunity is to drive it to our large service provider channel in conjunction with our Unified Communication Solutions. We will share more details about this enhanced vision for Project Tempo at Connection, our annual user and partner conference in November. This quarter, we also launched our latest mobile application UC-One Meet. This application enables mobile users to easily join a BroadSoft My Room voice/video conference or even other conference bridges from the user's own calendar with a single click. UC-One Meet also gives the ability to meet email the meeting organizers or all participants, for example, if you're going to be late to a meeting. Functionality continues to build upon the promise of focusing our Tempo vision on making our users more productive and effective.
On the BroadCloud expansion front, there are several points I want to talk about. First, we ended the quarter with more than 290,000 BroadCloud subs, which is up from 200,000 subscribers we announced at the end of last year's Q2. It's important to note that this sub growth is essentially all organic. To market BroadCloud, we held Cloud Connect events in Paris, France and Cologne, Germany in Q2. Events showcased our cloud capabilities with featured live demos of Project Tempo, UC-One and BroadSoft Contact Center and had 170 potential customers and partners in attendance. In Paris, we officially announced we're teaming with NextiraOne who selected our UC-One to power their new cloud-based UC solution. At the event in Germany, we announced a partnership with Snom, a well-known IP handset manufacturer to enable our German BroadCloud customers to use a completely CapEx-free model where the cost of phone is embedded into their monthly service fee.
Secondly, it's been five months since we announced the acquisition of Transera. So I thought it would be a good time to provide you with an update on our Contact Center business. Over the past few months, we presented our solution to our service providers worldwide and the response has been very positive. To date, several have been on-boarded and trained and are actively selling the product with several more in queue. These service providers have already closed several deals and a couple are in production. In addition, we've also found a significant interest in the use of our Contact Center Solution from service providers for their own needs for interacting with their end customers.
As we announced last quarter, one of our service provider partners, Broadsmart chose the Salesforce edition of our product for their internal contact center and we see the potential for more wins in this area. While early, we're seeing positive indicators of demand and believe it will be reflected in the strong pipeline for 2017. We continue to see cloud expansion as a key component of our future growth and believe our continued investment and focus in this business will benefit us greatly in 2017 and beyond.
On our sell-through priorities, hopefully all of you saw the announcement regarding our win with Rogers Communications. BroadSoft was selected as the underlying engine for Unison, a new mobile solution for our businesses. The service is designed to provide large enterprise-wide communication features in a full mobile environment that even SMB customers can access. This includes fixed mobile one number and native dialing, dual persona and auto attendant capabilities. Importantly, SMB customers also have the ability to self-serve on changing or adding features with simple Web portal, which was created by BroadSoft Design.
We're delighted to have been selected by Rogers for this service. This service launch is significant as it was designed to be mobile-first and the first of these services we've seen in North America. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to welcome Jeff Kahn, who recently joined the company as our Chief Transformation Officer. In this newly created position, Jeff will oversee the human resources department, identify strategic initiatives and enhance organizational effectiveness and help drive our investment in human capital. We believe BroadSoft's entrepreneurial culture has been a significant driver of our success and we see his role as an important step in maintaining that, even as we have grown to more than 1,500 employees, located in more than 20 countries around the world.
Jeff brings with him great industry experience, as he was previously the Chief Strategy Officer at AudioCodes.
With that, I would turn the call over to Jim. Jim.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. I'm excited to report our Q2 2016 results and note that this marks our eighth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Total revenue in the quarter was $82 million, up 27% from the year-ago period. Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.49 represented 53% year-over-year growth and was driven by revenue strength and lower than expected expenses. Software revenue of $34 million was up 12% over last year's Q2, led by growth in Europe and Asia.
Subscription and maintenance support revenue was $37 million, up 36% year-over-year. Of this amount, SaaS revenue was $12.8 million as compared to $12 million last quarter and $8.5 million in last year's Q2. Professional services and other revenue of $11 million was up 54% year-over-year, driven by our Network Transformation project. Total billings were $86 million, up 22%. Software billings were $33 million, up 2% compared to Q2 of last year. Subscription and support billings were $40 million, up 33%; professional services and other billings were $14 million, up 63%. Now on to margins and expenses. In Q2, we had gross margin of 77%, which was a 200 basis point improvement versus the year-ago quarter. Software margin was 95%, up from 93% in the year-ago period, driven by revenue growth on a nearly flat cost of sales number.
Subscription and support margin was 74%, up from 70% last year. This improvement was due primarily to maintenance and SaaS revenue growth and increasing scale in our SaaS business. Professional services margin was 33% as compared to 16% in the year-ago period due to higher revenue. For Q3, we expect overall cost of sales to increase about $1 million.
This is largely due to our continued investments in our Cloud business, as well as additional head count in our professional services organization. Operating margin increased to 19% versus 16% a year ago. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $47 million. Our expectation for Q3 is that OpEx will increase to approximately â by approximately $2.5 million to $3 million from Q2. Moving to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was at a strong $14 million. Net cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $357 million at the end of June, up from $345 million at the end of the first quarter. Accounts receivables were $106 million at the end of June, up sequentially in a normal seasonal fashion. Deferred revenue increased sequentially by almost $5 million to $107 million.
Now on to guidance, as you may have seen in our earnings press release, we expect Q3 revenues to be in the range of $78 million to $83 million and EPS to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.41.
For the year, our revenue guidance remains unchanged at $332 million to $340 million. We now expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $1. 95 to $2.15. I wanted to provide a little more color on our annual revenue guide. Overall, as you can see from our guide, we continue to track to our annual expectations for revenue. In terms of the components of revenue for the second half, I think we will see a bit more revenue from PS and a bit less with BroadCloud than we had originally forecasted.
I expect PS to grow on an annual basis in the range of 12% to 50% over 2015, driven by these transformation projects. On SaaS, while we are pleased with both our BroadCloud subscriber growth of about 45% exiting June and with our progress so far in creating what is now a substantive business revenue contributor for us. I do not think we're going to hit the 2016 revenue growth rate I'd suggested on our February 29 earnings conference call. I think our SaaS business for 2016 will grow closer to 46% to 48% and I expect Q3 SaaS revenue to be pretty flat relative to Q2.
There are a few drivers here. Certainly, FX will hurt us in the second half in the UK where we have a substantial cloud business. In the U.S., the Verizon strike and XO's pending sale to Verizon has hurt us with both carriers which has a disproportionate impact on our overall cloud results. We also have made some pricing changes, particularly in one geography that have reduced billing, even with the unit growth. Finally, some of the new projects we thought would positively impact the second half of 2016 to more or like early 2017 events now. More positively, I do think we will see a reacceleration of BroadCloud going into 2017. We are substantially increasing our BroadCloud product and channel offerings. We see real upside with federal government opportunities and I think we will see a return to accelerating growth with Verizon.
With that, before we go to Q&A, let me turn the call over to Chris for a couple of announcements.
Chris Martin - Investor Relations
Thanks, Jim. I have two announcements to make. The first is that we're going to be hosting an Analyst Day on Monday, December 5 in New York City. We'll have more details to share with you as we get closer to the event. But if you're interesting in attending, please visit the Events page on the Investor Relations section of the â of our website at www.broadsoft.com, where you'll find a registration link to the 2016 Analyst Day.
And then secondly, as part of our Form 8-K earnings press release filed today, we've included a separate exhibit, which provides information for illustrative purposes only of the impact of our convertible notes on our fully diluted share count at various hypothetical stock prices. If you have any questions on either topic, you can email me at cmartin@broadsoft.com.
Operator, please open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Mike, I was hoping you could give a little more color on the new transformation projects that you mentioned on the call. Sort of, what you were doing for that service provider before â sort of been what you're incrementally doing for them? You mentioned it quickly, but I just want to get a better sense of what the incremental work you've been doing for them is?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Right, Rich. So we've been working with this particular operator on a number of UC offerings, what I would, like normally consider kind of new offers to market; so net new customers both on the small and medium range of the marketplace. What this particular piece is, is a portion of their legacy network that was running on a generation one voice over IP platform that we are migrating onto BroadWorks. So we're moving about 100,000 business users from that Generation 1 platform.
So going forward, we'll continue to work with them in expanding the offers that already are in marketplace. We're working with them on potentially moving up market a bit with that â with this particular operator and there may be, in fact, some additional transformation capabilities or transformation opportunities at this particular operator.
So while, as we've said before, some of these transformational wins are going to be very large and some are going to be more modest in number, we just wanted to kind of highlight this one as an important Q2 activity.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. And then, with respect to your license book, I guess really billings growth, you've had a few light quarters in a row there and I think before, it's been sort of suggested that maybe you're transitioning more towards a Cloud business that you would expect some deceleration in the perpetual license part of your business and you've suggested maybe â you didn't really think that was the case. But now we've had this for a few quarters, I mean, what are your thoughts on the longer-term trajectory of the license piece of your business? Does that continue to grow in line with the overall top line or should we expect that to decelerate a bit as you shift more towards a cloud model?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
I think on a relative basis, longer term, cloud will grow faster than software. But historically, software has grown in the high-teens. And I think generally, we expect that to continue. I do think we're seeing it's less about cloud and more just â the cadence on the network for information deal and so you can just see this pretty exceptional growth in professional services and that's the PS for these transformation projects tend to be clearly concentrated upfront. And then as Mike alluded to, even with AT&T and Collaborate, as they move their legacy seats on to software, we'll get those â that software order, but that's really over time; we're just at the beginning.
So, I think overall billing was north of 20%. Software was â on a relative basis, a little light, but I think it's all in line with our expectations or the guide for the rest of the year.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. So can you just confirm that Collaborate is the perpetual license deal then with AT&T?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Rich, all the transformation deals are software deals.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Appreciate it.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks Rich.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is open.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. Can you hear me?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
That's great. Thanks. So â good morning. So, yeah, I guess, as I dig in here, I was trying to figure out on the 2% license billings growth, kind of picking up on the question from before. Can you just â should we expect that number to accelerate as you go out over the course of the year?
Again, I'm just trying to get my hands on either just what the outlook for that business looks like. I'm kind of struggling with it because as we said earlier, it's been slow for a number of quarters now and I'm trying to figure out how that changes.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I â the answer is yes and I certainly expect software billings (22:25) and the â again, I just think you're seeing a few things. One is the cadence with these network transformation projects and you can again see that in the PS. Two, we realistically need to grow to hit our guidance for the year. And we obviously reaffirm that. And the â so I think it's all correct that â the other thing I'd say and I know â in sort of alluding to this each time, but Q2 last year was a particularly strong billings quarter. And we had a â I mean it was sort of interesting, 2015 was more proportionately software billings in the first half than we had historically, so the Q1 and Q2 were a bit of a tough comp from a software standpoint. So, sorry for the long-winded answer, George, but one, yes, we'll see growth for the year. Two, I don't think that you're seeing the harbinger of fundamental slowdown in the business. As I said, overall billings were up in the 20%s and I think, three, you'll see acceleration in the second half.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then when I think about the mixture of license revenue, how much of that now comes from transformation projects versus kind of the normal everyday business?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean it's a little hard and I think that network transformation now that we're north of 10 deals has become almost just part of the overall mix for us, but it's still relatively weighted to our normal business, not to transformation projects.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. Okay. Great, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, guys. A couple of questions. First, on the AT&T Collaborate announcement, can you help us understand how much of the investment there is behind us versus ahead of us? Is that a new deal to you or just a new deal to us?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
It's a newer deal to you than us.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, it's â I mean, lots of, as Michael has referred to these as construction projects, lots of guys in hard hats still pounding away at the job site, but a lot of the services work for that has been done.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah. I think what you will see is, as I mentioned before is, AT&T is just entering market with the service plans that we have together is to expand that service obviously across a wide variety of segments. And so we're just starting to see the beginning of that â of our joint business with AT&T and then, we haven't really started even to look at the legacy transformation portions yet that will take place. So I think almost all of it is ahead of us.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then can you update us on the customer sell-through in the period, how that trended relative to the last couple quarters? You're guiding Q3 a little bit below consensus. How much of that is just normal seasonality versus some of the changes you mentioned in the business due to FX pricing internationally?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, we really do think of the business sort of from an annual guide basis, sort of down. And so, you're right from a consensus standpoint that the guide to Q3 is a little bit below consensus. But I think we're tracking as we really expected to the year. Sell-through, Q2 was a very good solid sell-through quarter, no issues from a sell-through standpoint.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last one from me, if I look at the first half of the year, we saw a nice margin improvement relative to 2015; yet your earnings outlook for the year seems to imply that margins will be down in the second half even though volumes will be up quite a bit. So just wanted to understand some of the dynamics there driving the second half outlook and to what extent there's conservatism, the impact of M&A or were there some expenses that got pulled â that got pushed out. Just trying to understand how come we wouldn't see margins further improve in the second half.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah. I mean, that you â and you guys know the way that we go about guidance is really pretty bottoms up. And the â and so from a bottoms-up standpoint, we â those are â that's basically our â the spend that we expect to do. I'll readily admit that historically, we haven't always met those spending assumptions or spending objectives, but that â but it's really continued BroadCloud growth and investment in â especially on the sales and marketing line. So, it's the bottoms-up guide and really reflective of our plan.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just on the gross margin side, I mean, given some of the mix dynamics you played out, is the strength in professional services the main reason we wouldn't see some of the Q2 gross margin improvement continue going forward? Just help me kind of walk through that.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, you're â it's a little bit of substitutional in terms of PS on the margin is just lower gross margin revenue line.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, guys.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Dmitry Netis of William Blair. Your line is open.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. Nice quarter guys.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Couple questions. Mike, for you first. In the script, you noted pretty â there's excitement around kind of the service provider vertical and some of the opportunities. You said "more and more service providers are launching converged FMC Solutions." Can you give us a little more color what that means? You seem to imply maybe there is more ahead than what you had seen so far. So if this is true, and maybe you can give us a little color on that? How much more to go versus the 10 transformation projects you have? What are you seeing out of Vodafone? Is that spreading beyond just Germany and will you connect Rogers to be one of those 10 transformation projects?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah, So, let me sort of piece together that question, Dmitry. So, I think first of all, let me just make a comment on the Rogers offer because I think as I noted in the script, I think it's quite an interesting offer. We've been working with a number of operators around the world really looking at launching solutions that are mobile-first or really targeted at mobile endpoints in a really integrated, native way. And we see generally the interest and the solutions offered by those are very tightly mobile integrated solutions to be very high in the marketplace across a wide variety of end users from very small to very large corporates that are looking to simplify and reduce the number of devices, end points and phone numbers into a single enterprise infrastructure.
Obviously, our customer base the operators are in a really great position to play that out in terms of delivering a mobile-first solution. And so, that's really the reason for the excitement around the Rogers offer, which is a really nice native integration to the Rogers, Rogers mobile network in Canada. It is obviously a similar â you made a similar comment about our offer in Vodafone Germany; again a similar offer where we're very tightly integrated to the mobile network, making â excuse me, making any mobile device a UC device for the enterprise. We think that's going to be the future of the business. More and more of our operators are building those and the Rogers one is interesting because it's one of the first in North America that we've seen. So I think we're going to see a really great â really great interest in that offer and really great success in the marketplace.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
You count that as a transformation project? The Rogers one..
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Technically it is, yes. I didn't really bring that out in the script. I think we're at a point now where we're past 10 transformation deals. And I thought the bigger point in the script was the â was this â was this mobile integration. I thought it was a much more important element than the fact that we â 11 (33:24) transformation deals, so that's why I highlighted the mobile portion of it.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, very good. Thank you. And then for Jim, if I may, just can I gauge the conservatism there on the second half? If you look at the kind of the ramp there, it implies about 14% half-over-half ramp versus 32% last year versus similar kind of in the same ballpark in 2014 timeframe. So, it seems like an easy bar, Jim. So, can you give us a sense is that just conservatism, is it maybe BroadCloud kind of taking a little bit gas off the momentum there that's causing you to put the guidance out there the way you did? Just give us a sense there on that second half guidance.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Easy for you, Dmitry. So, like I said to a previous question, we really think of building years, not kind of quarter-by-quarter sequence. And I think we continue to track for the year. I will note, if you remember, Q4 last year, we had that $7 million of revenue that came in right at the end that we really were expecting in 2016, not 2015. So that does two things: one, it wasn't 2016 revenue. And the other is, it does make the comp for 2016 a little cautious or a little harder. There's nothing about the business that's decelerating. I think we're â we had a great first half in building to the year and I think we continue to track. So I don't think there's any difference in prospective methodology or tone of the business for the track, it's sort of we're either in one â we're either â you guys are really worried about, can we do the second half ramp or worried that we're being overly cautious in our second half. So I think it's pretty balanced guide.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Even if I take that Q4 2015 and move that over to this year, you're still 18%, 19% second half of this year over last year versus 27% so, it still seems pretty easy compare â comparison, but I got it, so thank you. Maybe one last one on the book, on the professional services side, what are you expecting, it sounds like there is acceleration towards the second half of the year, which will essentially drive, I assume, license growth in the 2017 timeframe. So can you comment on that? Is that indeed the case? Would you expect professional services to slow in 2017 timeframe or will that still sort of track along the trajectory you've seen this year?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, it's a little early to get real specific of 2017. But I think as a general statement, I do think professional services will grow more slowly than the rest of the business and â as even with the bump up in the guide this year and I think that will definitely be true next year. And yes, I do think that we've seen really â relatively small software impact on many of these software transformation deals and there are several of them, Mike mentioned Rogers and AT&T and third one on today's call and those all are with volume ahead of us, and I think they all will be volume contributors and revenue contributors next year.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Growing more slowly on PS means you do expect growth in professional services in 2017 timeframe?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I would expect growth in 2017.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. Good luck, guys.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks, Dmitry.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Your line is open.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Oh, thank you for taking my call. Three questions. One, some housekeeping, can you give us the split-out between U.S. and Europe? Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, of the 81.7% in revenue, 46% North America, 25% EMEA, and Emerging was 11%, so that was 56% North America, 30% EMEA, 14% Emerging is how the pie chart looks. And from a growth standpoint, we saw very substantial growth outside the U.S. So EMEA was 54% growth, Emerging 112% and North America was growth, but single-digit, probably 6%. I think North America has been kind of the real locomotive for us and it's good to see the other regions catching up.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. That leads to my second question. So BroadCloud, little bit sluggishness there, you guys have â my model had been recording revenue in that BroadCloud since late 2012. Any particular reason why this â you haven't seen the switch flip on, on BroadCloud? Can you give some more clarity on what â is it people aren't adopting white label services as fast as you think it is? Is it the fact that the conversions moving to collaboration with the carriers? Any more detail around why that really hasn't accelerated would be helpful. Thank you.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, let me â I'll give you a little color and then kind of let Michael do a bit more big picture, but I don't think there's any market â I don't think we're seeing a fundamental market adoption issue at all. I think it's a really attractive go-forward model for both us and carriers. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I think some of the reasons why it's decelerated are pretty specific. We have a lot of dependency on the numbers right now on Verizon XO and BT. With Verizon, I think the strike actually impacted us more than we had originally thought it would in terms of accelerating there. And I think there's lots of reasons to think that that comes back.
XO is in the midst of the acquisition with Verizon. And so I think we're somewhat status quo there until that gets done, so it's fine, but not a ton of growth. I think BT looks really good, still a little early and so that's really, that's sort of broadly one issue. Area two is we did adjust pricing, particularly from a market standpoint in one geography. We're learning as we go; margins don't look very attractive in that geo. And we did hit some volume clip level that which is â in some ways a good thing, but pushed down revenue at the expense â even though we had unit growth. So it was a bunch of different pieces. And then I think it's interesting to me as anything else is there're several projects, a few actually with the existing customers and then new implementation. And we really did think that they would move â start moving the growth needle in 2016. FedRAMP is an example and I think those are going to be really substantial contributors in 2017, but it just happened a little more slowly, so, Michael, you?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
(42:08) I think, Catharine, if you look at subscription models, the way, in my mind, you look at it and say there is existing channels or existing distribution, and the plans were, as Jim laid out, were impacted this year by some negative â with Verizon XO that impacted the folks that we're currently selling. And then the second part of our business is bringing new channels on and we have brought some of those new channels on. In the SaaS world, those new channels deliver very little in year. And so that's a little bit of the slowdown. So I don't â I see the dialogue going very well with BroadCloud channels where with increased the number of channels, we've spent some time this year growing the amount of geography, but again these are â this will all result in revenue increase in 2017 because it takes time to bring these new distribution on to our platform.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right, thanks. And then one last one on Rogers, that's been a long-term customer of yours, remember back in 2012, when they launched their one number dialing. So, I guess this is in addition to the IMF infrastructure support, this new win?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Correct, correct. And then â and Catharine, you would be the only one that remembered that, so good for you. You have a better memory than most. But yes, that's...
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
All right. Thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hi, hey. Good morning. Question on gross margins, how should we look at gross margins the next few quarters? What's the dynamics playing out in margins, a little confused on how should we look at the slight margin upside in the print and extrapolate over the next few quarters? What's driving the margin upside and the sustainability of gross margins? Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I mean I think gross margins will be roughly flat, maybe 100 basis points down in Q3, sort of the guide is on our top line, it's flattish. And we said we'd bump up expenses about $1 million. And then you will see our normal Q4 gross margin expansion just because of a fair amount of our cost of sales is fixed in nature or fixed â relatively fixed over a certain time period, especially on the software line. So just a little bit of software does drive margins pretty substantially. So I think we'll be back in the 80% zip code for Q4 and pretty even with â for the year, gross margins from last year, maybe up a little bit. And so I think we're tracking â you know the dynamics where it's â we're seeing margin expansion, essentially in all our revenue lines. But the mix is faster with SaaS and PS which have lower margins, so you kind of have that interplay of those trends that get you to kind of the â we did 77% last year. I think we're in the 77%, 78% zip code for this year.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So, Jim, if we extrapolate from your comments, could we anticipate relatively weak demand trends for the SaaS business and the mix kind of skewing more towards software licenses, is that why you're slightly positive on the margin outlook moving forward?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Well â I mean so, the SaaS business is still going to grow 46% plus for the year, right, and it will be a little softer for the second half. I think going into next year, my expectation for 2017 is SaaS continues to be our fastest growing line item. But yeah, sure, I mean just a little bit of software growth which you will see in the second half will positively impact gross margins.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Jim.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks. Guys, any 10% customers?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We had none for the first half, we did four Q2.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
...is significantly greater than 10% or can you give us any sense?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
No, it was â I mean, as normal for us, if we have a 10%, it's in that zip code, so not substantially bigger.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. And then on the network transformation deals, I think I heard my sales were 11 (47:47) still, I don't know if you were speaking wishfully or if that's the exact number. But I was hoping you could us tell us the number of wins, how many of those are now in revenue, it sounds like there were three new network transformation deals at least that you've announced and I recognize some of these are â probably date back further than that, but you're just announcing them. And on the same topic, how many opportunities are out there, but not yet awarded and what's the timing? And I've got one more question.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So yes, I think â I think publicly announced now is 11. I think Paul, to be honest, it's become pretty mainstream for us, these transformation deals. So, I think, we're going to be a little more hesitant in giving exact numbers from now on just because we're in double figures with the three. They are, I would say, two, 60% are we would be able to take revenue on right now, but that's â but by and large software is ahead of us on those deals. So, when we get software orders, we would be able to take revenue, but much more of that is in front of us than behind us. I'd say the pipeline continues to look good in terms of these deals. I mean again, I'll go all macro on you for a second, but you just have â every major network in the world is still predominantly TDM, some with Gen 140, that will go to IMS Flash 740 and those that have a substantial number of business lines on their legacy platform will, at some point, need to transform and we're the odds-on favorite to win those.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
So, Jim, that said, and I hate to ask such a mundane question in light of your response, but if we just looked at the wins you have to-date, is it possible to put a dollar number on the revenue opportunity from those 11 wins that you've announced to-date?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Like lifetime?
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Yeah. Or...
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, I mean, I think many of those are north of $10 million lifetime opportunities. So, I think you're in the â of those 11, I don't know, Mike, $60 million to $100 million total lifetime.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
More.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Maybe more.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Maybe more than that (51:05).
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
North of $100 million lifetime.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
All right. One more question, if I may. Going back to your pricing comments there, the one thing I didn't hear you say is what's driving it, is this simply to offset U.S. dollar appreciation in a particular region, what's going on...?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
I'm sorry Paul, ask that question again, apologize.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
With respect to your commentary about you having reduced pricing in particular in certain region, is this being driven by the ongoing appreciation of the U.S. dollar or is there something that â what is going on â what's driving that?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Oh, got it. Yeah, it's specific to BroadCloud, so it's a SaaS business and we're pretty new on this and I think we were a touch high going in on particularly one geography and just needed to â we had an assumed set of pricing. And we â it wasn't big, but we had to bring that pricing down and I think rightly and still very attractive business opportunity for us. And so â and part of it was the way we price BroadCloud is, there's a real full service kind of BroadCloud and we get higher price realization for that. There's a much â a more basic service where the carrier does more and our going-in assumption in that geo was that there would be more full service than it ended up being with the carrier doing more, which is actually fine by us. But on the increment, that reduced price realization.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
All right. My apologies to those on the call, but if I could ask quickly. I know you guys have been pretty dismissive of the competitive landscape historically, but 8x8 or RingCentral appear to be going up market. And the numbers have been strong on their mid-market business. Are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape? I understand you don't compete against them directly, but your customers are competing against them. Can you comment on them or any other competitors in terms of any changes one way or the other?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Well, I don't know where we said we've been dismissive. I watch everybody carefully, no, I think that the â look, the overall market is growing very briskly. I think the shift from anybody buying a legacy or a prem solution, that game is over. So I think we're seeing kind of all the possible channels that sell. Hosted is doing fairly â is doing very well and I think you see that in the results of companies like 8x8 and RingCentral and going broader appeal and up market.
So I think though the landscape hasn't changed very much. I mean we have obviously a much broader â it's a different strategy. Obviously as you say, we don't compete directly. We have broader distribution in the marketplace. And I think one of the really important changes I think we'll see is the emergence of mobile integration â tight (54:43) mobile integration is being a real differentiator for our service provider partners and therefore for BroadSoft-based solutions in general. So I think that's kind of how I see the next 12 months to 18 months.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
