I will now turn the call over to BroadSoft's President and CEO, Michael Tessler. Mike?
Michael Tessler
Good morning, and thank you for taking the time this morning to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. I'm just back from Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the mobile industry's largest trade show. Given our recent Voice over LTE customer announcements, we had very strong interests and a large number of meetings with both existing customers and prospects that wanted to better understand our technology and how operators are leveraging our rich set of features for both consumer and business end customers. We shared our view that operators need to have both consumer and business focus strategies for their LTE rollouts, with a strong emphasis on servicing the full range of business customers with unified communications solutions.
Our mobile operator strategy is to leverage our extensive unified communication's experience and bring those capabilities to operators Voice over LTE deployments. This puts us in a unique position given our extensive rollout on IMS around the world. In fact, it's clear that we created a new product category, the business TAS or telephony application server. With our product, we have brought the best of unified communications and combined it with the power of next generation wireless networks.
So why this is so important for the industry and our customers? First, for our customers, enterprises both large and small want to break down the silos between their legacy PBX infrastructures and their mobile services enabling their employees to be fully mobile. This leads to greater personal and team work [ph] productivity while lowering costs. They no longer want one business phone number in subscription for their fixed line and a separate phone number in subscription for their mobile device. They are seeking a single subscription for all of the employees communications services, which they can access from a desk phone, laptop, smartphone or tablet.
Our business telephony application server enables mobile operators to meet this market demand for mobile unified communications, while also providing new business services revenue for the operator. I believe that operators will see business Voice over LTE as an interesting market entry strategy and we believe we are in the best position to help them.
Second, as an industry, the development of a mobile hosted unified communications market is disruptive to the legacy enterprise communication industry, speeding the transition away from premise-based PBX architectures. Those products were designed to work within the confines of a local area network and lack any real mobility capabilities. Maintaining a hardware box and a wiring closet to handle enterprise communications requirements is not realistic when people are communicating using mobile phones, tablets and cellphones from anywhere around the globe. And they are not only using voice calls to communicate but also video, instant messaging and web collaboration.
This industry disruption will be great for our service provider customers and will speed the adoption of our technologies. We've also demonstrated that our solution extends from business-to-consumer delivering a cost-effective solution for large scale consumer Voice over LTE deployments. We achieved very low cost of ownership through the significant virtualization of our software, delivering software-based media functions and reduced cost of integration and training through the use of a single-application server for all market segments; consumer, SOHO and the full range of business customers.
Our solution has proven interoperability in all the major IMS core networks and we have extensive set of integrations with third-party applications, again, contributing to lower cost and risk. Thanks to our enterprise capabilities and focus on the total cost of ownership, we have completed 3 contracts for Voice over LTE. As you may have seen in our January 29 press release, Sprint has selected us to power their business and consumer Voice over LTE services. Similarly, SaskTel has opted to leverage our single-platform architecture to serve both market segment needs. And our third agreement is with a converged operator who will specifically leverage us for their business services.
Importantly, we can enable delivery of unified communications services over existing 3G networks. Many of our mobile operator customers, especially those in Europe, are leveraging our BroadWorks server platform now to offer compelling fixed mobile conversion solutions over their existing 3G networks. They view these offers as a way to expand their relationship with their enterprise customers ahead of their LTE transformation. And then once these customer start migrating to Voice over LTE, BroadWorks will help them seamlessly transition their unified communication services from their legacy networks. We see more operators looking at this approach for adding new services to their existing mobile enterprise subscribers and then transitioning them to Voice over LTE when they are ready.
Switching back. Let's take a look back on 2013. If you recall, last year, we noted we would focused on the growing adoption of our full UC services, expand our go-to-market practice, invest in our cloud infrastructure and continue to grow our available products. We've successfully delivered on that strategic plan. We're extremely pleased by the number of customers who adopted our full range of unified communications services to enhance their Voice only offer. To offer greater flexibility and how our customers can acquire our unified communications services, we extended our BroadWorks capabilities with the introduction of BroadWorks Collaborate. BroadWorks Collaborate is a server product that enables our customers to offer UC-One components like instant messaging and presence and desktop sharing through servers deployed within their networks.
For BroadCloud, we expanded its availability into both the U.K. and German markets, which was driven by strong customer demand. We're very excited to recently announce BT Wholesale as our first customer take advantage of our BroadCloud expansion. BT Wholesale will leverage all of our BroadCloud services, including high-definition voice calling and conferencing, instant messaging and presence and web collaboration tools. Our BroadCloud services will strengthen BT Wholesale's unified communications capabilities.
In addition to BT, we have seen several major European service providers decide they need to enter the unified communications market to broaden their revenues from consumer to business customers. And as they recognize that time-to-market is now critical, many of them are exploring how BroadCloud could help them quickly launch into the market. Another one of our key objectives in 2013 was to invest in our go-to-market resources. Our go-to-market team works closely with our customers to drive successful introduction and rapid sales growth of their unified communications offers.
In 2013, we added to our consultancy staff, invested in our online resources. We completely revamped our customer portal and doubled the available content. Through these efforts, customers who leveraged these investments experience accelerated growth rate in their unified communications offers. And finally, we continue to innovate by investing in new technologies such as WebRTC, a global standard for integrating voice and video calling into web browsers.
BroadWorks provides gateway functionality between web browsers and VoIP networks, transcribing voice and video for WebRTC enabled browsers to any SIP endpoint. By converting web browsers into a BroadSoft powered endpoint, we are helping significantly reduce the cost to enterprises of acquiring hosted unified communications services. They will no longer need to invest in phones or logistics further transitioning away from hard devices. And with this new functionality, BroadWorks subscribers can now extend the benefits of unified communications outside of the enterprise, their customers and partners and reach the millions of users who have WebRTC enabled browsers, all while having a secure interface between the public Internet and a manageable network.
Now I'd like to share with you some of the key elements of our 2014 strategy. This year will be a year of continued investment and innovation and quality in order to ensure the success of our customers. Our strategic objectives focus on continuing to accelerate the adoption of our UC-One capability globally. Interest from BroadWorks Collaborate since we introduced it last fall has been very high and working closely with these customers to implement and deploy these server-based unified communications services. We'll also continue to invest in BroadCloud, enhancing its service capabilities so our customers can take advantage of its proven, faster time-to-market and accelerated time-to-revenue.
With BroadWorks software services and BroadCloud's managed services approach, we offer our customers the flexibility to choose their preferred route to market, to extend their hosted services beyond voice only offers to full unified communications. We're also increasing our investment in new ways of supporting our customers' go-to-market efforts. In addition to helping them to find successful offers, we have strengthened our sales enablement strategies and tools, as well as develop new customer nurturing marketing programs, which are all designed to increase the take rate of their UC services.
And we'll continue to exploit our unique mobile capabilities, whether mobile operators looking to offer advanced unified communications services over their existing 3G network and then later transition these services to LTE or whether a mobile operator is seeking to select their applications server now for their Voice over LTE services, we will collaborate with mobile operators in order to enable them to capitalize on a $26 billion unified communications services market opportunity and more rapidly displace PBX offers.
By remaining laser-focused on our strategic investments in our UC platform, cloud delivery infrastructure and unique mobile capabilities, we'll continue to provide the critical communications tools businesses require to advance employee productivity and to keep consumers connected, securing our leadership position in the industry.
Let me now hand the call over to Jim who will go through our financial results and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2014. Afterwards, I'll be happy to answer any questions. Jim?
James A. Tholen
Thanks, Mike. Let me provide the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and then the full year 2013, before I go over our Q1 and full year 2014 guidance.
For Q4, total revenue was $52 million, up 13%, 1 year ago. Billings, which we defined as revenue plus a change in deferred revenue, were a strong $71.9 million, up 36% year-over-year and up 76% from Q3 2013. For Q4, our hosted unified communications offering was a primary growth engine across all regions worldwide. From a geographic perspective, EMEA and North America were the Q4 growth drivers. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.45.
Let me give you a bit more color on our Q4 revenue in billings. Software license revenue was $27.3 million, up 12% year-over-year. Software license billings were $33 million, up 35% year-over-year. Our hosted UC business really drove our Q4 results, showing strength worldwide. We also saw strength across customer sizes with growth from our Tier 1, Tier 2 and cable customers. While our trunking business cooled off a bit in Q4, the full year was still up significantly from 2012. The SIP trunking market outside the U.S. is still in its early stages but I'd note that in 2013, in both Europe and APAC, we did see some meaningful pickup in adoption and sell-through in those geographies.
Our consumer business had a better end to the year than anticipated. For the full year, consumer contributed about 9% of total software revenue. Our subscription and maintenance services revenue, which includes our cloud SaaS business, was up 21% year-over-year to $20.2 million. Software support and maintenance revenue was up 10% year-over-year. Cloud SaaS revenue contributed -- continued to grow strongly, and was about 9% of the total in Q4. Our HIPCOM acquisition added north of $1 million in net revenue.
Total subscription and maintenance billings was $33.6 million, up 39% from 1 year ago. Q4 is a heavy subscription and maintenance billing quarter for us as many of our software customers are on a Q4 annual renewal cycle. This trend was further benefited by a customer that executed a multi-year maintenance from renewal contract with us. Professional services revenue of $4.4 million was down 5% from the year ago period. Professional services billings of $5.4 million were up 22% from the year ago quarter and were driven by some longer-term projects that should be recognized for revenue in 2014.
Now moving onto cost and margin. In Q4, we had gross margin of 83% versus 85% last year. While we did lose a couple of gross margin points due to revenue mix, as our BroadCloud business grew proportionately faster, we were pleased that we've been able to maintain our healthy margin profile while growing our BroadCloud business from scratch over the last couple of years. For Q1 2014, I'd expect overall cost of sales to increase about $1 million from Q4 levels, driven largely by our continued investment in our BroadCloud business including the finocom acquisition.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $29.3 million, which included approximately $500,000 in expenses and fees related to our finocom acquisition. Operating margin was a healthy 27%. For Q1 2014, we expect non-GAAP operating expense to be up about $2 million from Q4 levels. The sequential increase is being driven largely by headcount additions within R&D and sales, primarily focused on cloud, VoLTE, sell-through and other growth initiatives. Our OpEx investments are being front-end loaded for the year and as a result, we'll see somewhat muted sequential expense growth throughout the year apart from our normal Q4 end of the year uptick.
For the full year 2013, revenue was $178.5 million, representing annual growth of 8%. Billings of $195 million grew 15%. Overall, we saw strength in our hosted and SIP trunking software businesses as well as our emerging cloud SaaS business, which nearly doubled to over $12 million. This was partially offset by weakness in consumer and professional services revenue. From a geographic perspective, we had a healthy revenue growth across all geographic areas. Non-GAAP EPS for 2013 was $1.22, and we generated approximately $40 million of operating cash flows in 2013 after adjusting for the impact of the $7.5 million windfall tax accounting treatment on cash flow from operations.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $187 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Accounts receivable of $66.6 million, were up $21.7 million from Q3, driven by the strength in billing. Deferred revenue of $77.7 million was up $20 million from Q3, with significant increases in both software and subscription and maintenance support deferred. We used about $9.7 million in cash for the acquisition of finocom during the quarter and cash flows from operations was $9.6 million.
Now, I'd like to spend some time talking about our Q1 2014 and full year 2014 outlook. As you've seen in our press release, we expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $42 million to $46 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.01 to $0.12. For the year, we expect revenue in the range of $206 million to $212 million and EPS in the range of $1.26 to $1.46.
A couple of things to note regarding your full year modeling. In 2014, we expect that our hosted business should again be our key growth driver. Our trunking business should also see solid growth and consumer should be down on an absolute basis but its impact should be more muted given its relative size today. We expect our cloud business to more than double compared to 2013 and that professional services should see an uptick in 2014 from 2013 levels given revenue recognition on several projects.
We expect that our finocom acquisition should add approximately $2.5 million in revenue in 2014 and a couple of pennies of dilution from the acquisition is incorporated in our guidance. Regarding our tax rate, we now expect that we will maintain a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 2% at least through 2016, and we move to an approximate 20% tax rate starting in 2017 beginning on our revised analysis of use of our NOL.
And finally, if you reverse engineer our revenue and EPS guidance, you'll note that it generally implies a flat to down operating margin for the year. As Mike mentioned, we've made great strides on our strategic initiatives including driving our unified communications business, our BroadCloud delivery platform and our VoLTE consumer and enterprise offerings. And as you may recall, on our Q3 2013 earnings call, we talked about a growing opportunity in front of us to win large seven-figure multi-year unified communications in VoLTE deals.
I think that our recent customer announcements are affirmations of our strategic direction and investments made in 2013 regarding our cloud and mobile offerings. Here, at the start of 2014, we believe we are poised to continue to aggressively win in our marketplace. As a result, we've chosen to turn the dial more to investing our selling power and product offerings versus lifting margins near-term. So in 2014, while we don't expect to see margin expansion to our long-term model, we affirm that the 28% to 30% operating margin target remains our goal.
In 2014, we continue to actively prosecute additional large strategic deals and are excited by the opportunity to work with many of the largest operators in the world as they drive their businesses around IP and hosted solutions. While we won't always be able to announce these strategic wins, they're all positive for us and to our business model.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, will you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs.
Kent Schofield - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
This is Kent Schofield in for Simona. I wanted to bounce a couple of questions off you guys in terms of the operating expense side of things. In the near-term, you talked about a $2 million sequential higher. Could you give us a little bit of color as to what's driving that because it does look like a fairly significant sequential, if I look back historically for you guys? And then the other thing is, as you mentioned, getting to your longer-term target, do -- does it look like the revenue opportunities are such that you'll continue to be striving towards that in 2015? Or is that a target of 28% to 30% that you think you might be able to reach then?
James A. Tholen
Yes, Kent. So this is Jim. Two things. On the operating cost jump, a decent chunk of that is full quarter, the finocom acquisition, which really didn't have any appreciable expense in Q4. And the rest of the investment is, as we mentioned in R&D and in sales headcount. So -- but the big sort of nonorganic chunk is, finocom. Then in terms of the long-term model, I would expect '15 to see trajectory towards that. But at this point, we're not forecasting that margin to be 2015.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
I wanted to get some comment on the recent wins you had, especially around Sprint and British Telecom and, potentially even Deustche Telecom with your acquisition of finocom assets. If you could walk us through each of those, give us maybe some sense of the size of these opportunities, the potential margin impact within those opportunities? That would be great.
Michael Tessler
Dmitry, I'll start with the, I guess, the strategic side and then Jim can have any comments on the number side. I think, obviously, we're very pleased with the Sprint announcement, as you've read, pretty important win across both the consumer and business side of their VoLTE deployments, I think, in a large-scale mobile operators. So pretty pleased by that and the fact that we're really starting a strategic relationship with Sprint across modernizing their whole network, looking at various segments, looking at various rollout. So pretty happy with the win and a pretty significant step in our Voice over LTE strategy. And think about on the flip side, on the BT announcement, pretty happy with that also as we talked about through last year, we continue to kind of discuss the rationale for our BroadCloud investments and why we're doing it and the fact that we really felt that BroadCloud was an important delivery means for lots of Tier 1 carriers around the world, and we're very happy to announce BT, the Wholesale group, is really expanding from the business they were doing with HIPCOM to a full BroadCloud PBX solution and also really kind of expanding the sales and marketing efforts along with BT. So both those are pretty important strategic wins and also demonstration on 2 of our really important strategic initiatives. Jim, I don't know if you want to comment on any of the forward numbers?
James A. Tholen
Yes. So, Dmitry, I'd just, probably just reemphasize Mike's point. I mean, I think strategically, those really are impactful wins and we're -- to be honest, thrilled with those. I would not expect the Sprint deal to be revenue this year. We will certainly get billings from it but it's a very positive long-term deal. And as Mike said, both consumer and enterprise. And then BT, we'll -- it will build up over time but it will absolutely be '13 SaaS revenue -- '14 SaaS revenue.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
And then on the margin? On the margin, Jim, can you comment how much of a margin impact, especially the BroadCloud Wholesale agreement with BT? How much of an impact could we see there in the margins, if any?
James A. Tholen
Yes, I don't think it's appreciable. We sort of said in our remarks, and we've been able to really build BroadCloud within our margin structure and, I think, that it's really kind of an investment Europe [ph] question, and we'll continue to manage that within our margin structure.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
And then last question I have, if I may. Just with the finocom, you seem to be opening up the spigot for direct competition with the carrier customers. So would you be able to comment on sort of motivation around this deal and your strategy there?
Michael Tessler
Sure. I mean, we're -- as we've stated a number of times, we are -- our strategy is to enable the service providers with managed services solutions. It's accurate that finocom is -- has had a retail component in the past, not the strategic rationale for the acquisition. As we stated the strategic rationale was to expand our BroadCloud PBX offering into Germany and also used the 2 centers between HIPCOM in the U.K. and finocom in Germany really help us build out our European operations around BroadCloud PBX. So these 2 organizations are pretty important for us to be able to scale that business in Europe.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty Markets.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division
And Jim, quick thing, could you repeat just quickly on cloud piece of the business because it looks like the growth margins are going down overall, and I want to get a better understand of -- understanding of how to look at the leverage in the model because I think a lot of the investors are really keen on the leverage and if we could go back and revisit that? And then, I have a question on about Voice over LTE.
James A. Tholen
So Catherine, just to be clear, you're asking about the gross margin trajectory on cloud?
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division
Yes.
James A. Tholen
So, as we've said, the cloud gross margins are -- they're in the 70% to 80% range. And it's just from a mix standpoint, it's below softer than the 90s. So we've said that we've have proportionately different growth with cloud. You sacrifice a couple margin points but your margin dollars certainly go up. And we said--- as we've said, I think we are -- we grow that business, we'll be able to maintain our overall margin structure. I don't think -- the margins of the cloud business have not declined over time.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division
And then, Mike, at Mobile World Congress, there is a lot of chatter on Voice over LTE and the fact that if you're on an IP network that the signal in IP kind of drops dramatically, where in 3G networks, the signals don't. It's more plateaued the farther you go out. So there was discussion on -- if that's the case, maybe VoLTE deployments could be held up and I just wanted to hear your -- what you think of that timing versus some of the, I guess, physics issues of the spectrum?
Michael Tessler
Well, Catherine, I have to admit I haven't been a physicist for a while. So...
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division
Either have I, sorry.
Michael Tessler
I think we've, frankly, we've been stating for a while that Voice over LTE has had its numerous challenges. You are identifying one which on the radio side. I think we're going to start seeing some deployments in this year. But there is -- there's a number of quality issues that people are working through, both on the radio side and signaling side. And there's huge investment in IT infrastructure that's going on. So that's why we've been consistently very cautious about how quick we think that transformation takes place. We're certainly seeing a lot more -- the operators really focus on the few remaining quality issues and we'll have to see whether or not they can solve some of those and get those launched this year.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division
So net-net, you feel very strong about more opportunities outside the 3 that you've announced, and that you see pretty healthy pipelines in 2014 for VoLTE?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I mean, I think, as we stated in our remarks, I think, one of the things that a lot of the operators, I think -- a lot of them were focused on the transformation of consumer as a cost-savings. I think our conversations with them around really leveraging VoLTE around the business customer, increasing the ARPU and actually moving money from one industry group to the mobile operator has really kind of opened a lot of discussions for us. And so we're pretty positive on that transformation. How long will it take for the mobile operators to work through some of these issues? Hard to tell. That's one of the reasons why we are seeing a lot of the operators start to consider rolling out some of these solutions over 3G, get started, and then, kind of figure out when they can move over to -- move their business customers over to LTE. So I think, net-net, it's been pretty positive for us and we see a fair amount of prospects in the pipeline.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Richard Valera from Needham.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
I wonder if you could give us any more color on your third VoLTE win, either geography size or consumer enterprise? And maybe how it relates to the prior 2 in terms of size? Any color would be helpful.
James A. Tholen
It's between SaskTel and Sprint.
Michael Tessler
I jumped. Yes, it's right in the middle. I think the -- we can't give too much color without identifying the operator, which we've been asked not to. So I think the thing to say is that it is -- the win is in the business area, focused on really being pretty disruptive on the small business side of the mobile operator, really going after the small business transformation and away from key systems in small PBXs to Voice over LTE. So it's primarily in the small to medium segment enterprise. It's a Tier 1 incumbent. That's what I can kind of tell you.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Okay. That's very helpful. And I'm not sure what you can say here, but I'm sure you saw that, in Telefonica, had their UNICA NFV initiative sort of announced at Mobile World Congress, and you were called out as one of the vendors that they were sort of including or trialing in that. Is there anything you can say about what -- which of your capabilities they're looking at incorporating into their UNICA potentially?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I think, let me just answer it generally, I think, what we are -- something we don't talk often about and is that our overall solution is -- has been being delivered on a variety of virtualization stacks for a number of years and many of the operators are now looking at how to completely kind of change their architecture around NFV and really deliver on these virtualization solutions. And so we are working with a number of operators in those kind of initiatives. Although in many cases, we're already deployed in their networks on virtualization stacks. We're doing a fair amount of work around plugging into operators orchestration solutions, so they can really move away from kind of hardware-based solutions that many of those -- many of the providers have been selling to them. But as many of you know, we've been -- we've never sold hardware. We're always been a software-based company. We've always been running on virtualization. So in the case of Telefonica, really working with them on -- as an existing customer, working with them on a full stack of capabilities.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
And just one more. So consumer looks like came in stronger-than-expected in 4Q, you ended up at 9% for the year. Is it safe to say you'd expect that down as a percent of revenue in 2014? And Jim, would you be willing to -- any color on sort of how much lower than 9% it might be?
James A. Tholen
Sure. Yes. So -- actually, the -- I think it will be down at , not just as a percentage but in absolute dollars. And I think it's going to be in the zip code of 5% of revenue.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen.
James A. Tholen
Paul, you on mute?
[Technical Difficulty]
Michael Tessler
Charlotte, can we go to the next caller? We'll come back to Paul.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank.
Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
I have 2 questions, if I may. The first question is on business VoLTE. Help us understand from your point of view, how do you look at this market opportunity this year and into next year in terms of millions of subs or in dollars? Just want to better understand, how you're scoping and sizing this opportunity from your point of view?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I think -- I don't think we are ready to give any specific guidance on the size of the opportunity. I think at this stage, where we see the business VoLTE as part of our overall unified communications opportunity and the fact that, with the enabling of Voice over LTE that operators, mobile operators, specifically, have the capability of kind of radically change delivery to enterprises around kind of PBX architectures. But right at this point, I don't think we're ready to split out what business VoLTE means versus our overall unified communications opportunity. I think it's, really, we see that as one right now. We just see that as a different type -- style of network that our customers can deliver on.

And then, the second question is around Microsoft Lync. We keep hearing about it during our channel checks. What's your thoughts on-premises solutions and Microsoft Lync, you view them as increasingly competitive in the SME side of your business?
Michael Tessler
I think we've always stated that we see -- first of all, just kind of step back, we're enabling the operators to compete with premise-based solutions from a variety of vendors. We see that hosted unified communications solutions are growing in popularity, getting stronger as enterprises, small medium and large, want to get away from the cost and complexity of running those infrastructures. And as we -- as I stated in my remarks, really want to take advantage of single subscription and mobility as part -- as really important parts of these solutions. So generally, I believe that carriers will see a growing opportunity to compete against premise-based solutions from many vendors, including Microsoft. And I think that we certainly see Microsoft, along with Cisco and others in the enterprise space, we're actually seeing very, very good progress in competing against that and in fact growing our share against the premise-based solutions. So I think, that's kind of the general trend we're seeing in the marketplace.

Our next question will come from the line of Subu Subrahmanyan from the Juda Group.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division
Jim, I was wondering if you could remind us about the large deal that coming into revenue recognition. I think the number was somewhere of the order of $15 million or so. And if I factor that into this year's numbers, doubling in BroadCloud and some revenue from finocom, it seems like that the rest of the business is kind of a low-single digit core. I just want to make sure the math on that is right. And then, VoLTE, I wanted to make sure I understood, do you expect any revenue from VoLTE this year at all? Or is a lot of that building into 2015 revenues?
James A. Tholen
Sure. Yes. I mean -- so just the -- first the characteristics on the large deal. It is about -- we expect it to be about $15 million for the year. We expect it to be ratable across the year. So we do expect to see proportional revenue from it in Q1. And it's part -- it's within the guidance. The -- as a general statement, in any particular year, if you take out our largest revenue, revenue growth rates go down, right? It's a sort of a -- it's a hard comparison. My expectation is that, while that comes -- about $12 million of the $15 million is on the balance sheet right now. Certainly, our goal is to build up software and other deferred underneath that as we recognize that. And some of these other large deals we talked about. So it's a sort of an apples and oranges on comparing revenue growth with some of it coming off the balance sheet and billings growth, which I continue to expect to be comfortable go forward growth. The -- and I'm sorry that -- Subu, the second part of your question was?
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division
On -- if there will be VoLTE revenues for...
James A. Tholen
Oh, VoLTE. Yes, yes. So actually, interestingly enough, we had VoLTE -- it was small, but we actually achieved VoLTE revenue ahead of time. There was a less than $0.5 million of -- or about $0.5 million of VoLTE revenue in Q4, which we were very happy about. I think there's -- it's going to be very small, revenue wise in 2014. I think we will have billing, but I think much of that billings activity will be deferred to '15 and later.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division
And if I can follow up on the first part, Jim. 2013, I just, the way I remember it, did not have any of those very large deals, that's why I was trying to make that comparison. Usually, you have -- 2013 would seem to be one of those years where there wasn't that kind of big lumpy rev rec to account for. So that seems like maybe more of a direct compare when you look at that large deal. And maybe you can just talk about what's going on in SIP trunking? And non-BroadCloud part of just enterprise BroadWorks, what kind of growth rates you are thinking about for that in 2014?
James A. Tholen
Yes. So -- I mean, look, it's always -- I mean, there's -- again, we got to be careful on selling activity growth and rev rec. So as you saw in Q4, as an example, the billings and software billings growth were significant growth beyond what we saw in revenue and essentially, none of that was from this large deal. So there was definitely ins and outs on deferred in '13. So it's always a mix that we manage on it and so, I guess, the headlines to me are if you look at billings, which is really the measure of growth. Last year was a little challenged because of -- especially because of consumer. We'll -- that will diminish in impact next year but it's still there. And I think hosted and the SIP trunking businesses will continue to grow quite nicely, and I expect hosted to be certainly north of 20%.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division
All right. And if I could ask a final question, on the VoLTE side, there was some consumable VoLTE wins in which in some of the wireless incumbents seem to have gotten in the 2013 timeframe with the large Tier 1 Incumbent carriers. Do you expect them to start making business VoLTE selections through the course of 2014 with the large U.S. Tier 1s?
Michael Tessler
Sorry, I...
James A. Tholen
Yes. Just -- I don't think we want to be that specific but suffice to say that between conversations we've had with our carrier customers and many of the conversations, Mike and Scott had -- and team had at Mobile World Congress, we think major incumbents across the globe, and certainly ones that we're close to are increasingly focused on the business VoLTE opportunity. So we're very bullish on our opportunity there.

Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Hoffman from Mizuho Company.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division
So a question on the pace at which operators are rolling out Voice over LTE. Is it possible that operators are too focused on quality of service around next gen IP-based voice communications, while WhatsApp, Facebook, FaceTime, these are models that are focused on cheap ad driven model? Is it possible that the OTT crowd will end up getting a head start that operators can't close. So is call quality, really what they should be focused in on here? Love your opinion.
Michael Tessler
Yes. It's a good -- I mean it's a good question. I think that generally operators, especially when we talk to them about the business side, I think, quality is quite important and I think there is a view that OTT has kind of a lower quality consumer free orientation. I think, like I said, I think when it comes to business, the business side, I think quality is quite important. It's where -- what they perceive as their main differentiator and, I think, I tend to agree with that. I think that generally, a lot of the mobile operators, feel like on the consumer side of things, went out with a -- if they start the transformation from 3G to 4G on voice and voice quality software, in most markets, Voice, mobile voice is pretty competitive and they would lose share to the competition. So I think when you're dealing with messaging apps and things that don't have kind of real-time as much real-time performance and/or are free, I think, customers are willing to take a little bit more of -- or accept less quality. But I think in the voice side of mobile networks, I think that will be pretty difficult for most mobile operators to compete against -- to rollout, if you like a less quality voice service.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division
So they're not really looking at it as a sliding scale, maybe good enough in consumer and excellent. And in enterprise just something to get out there and head off some of this competition that is obviously coming from Facebook, WhatsApp?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I think also, the other thing to think about is most of the mobile operators are switching to -- on the voice and messaging side and all you can eat and they're really just selling data. The primary barometer they're selling or packaging is around mobile -- minutes, mobile -- on the mobile data side. So it kind of reduces the threat. Why would I use an over-the-top voice app if my voice calling is free on my mobile network? So I think that over-the-top stuff's a little bit less threatening than I think everybody thinks about.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division
Good enough. Just a quick housekeeper for Jim. Help us understand some of the OpEx guidance by just giving us maybe the headcount at the end of the year and kind of what you expect the headcount will be at the end of 1Q or the end of the year? However you want to help us understand that? It sounds like that's the major component here and what's going in to the 1Q?
James A. Tholen
Yes. So -- yes. Head -- you'll see it in the K that got filed this morning, headcount at the end of the year is 725. We really don't guide to future headcount but it's -- the spend is mostly headcount driven. And again, a chunk of that is, we had essentially no finocom expense in Q4. And so we get the full quarter impact of that.

Our next question will come from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Securities.
Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division
This is Ryan MacDonald in for Mike Latimore. First question on, of the new UC deals you see, what percent are focused on the small business versus the mid-market?
Michael Tessler
Well, number of deal. I mean, that's probably hard to factor. Let me, probably say, one trend is that generally, the market entry position for us is on the smaller end. And we have seen many operators start with, let's say, 50 lines and below using our technology. And in the last 24 months, have started to see more and more of those move up to mid and even large enterprise. That's the typical roll-out. It's not the only path, if you like. I'd also say that, generally we see more activity than we did 24 months ago in large -- in mid and large enterprise segments around rolling out our technology through mobile operators, so through fixed mobile operators. I think, generally, is the operators has got more comfortable with hosted unified communications. They started to present these solutions to larger and larger end user clients and we're seeing adoption of that technology in the mid and large segments. So that's, generally -- hard to tell you on a deal-by-deal basis. I'm not sure, I can -- we have that visibility.
Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division
Got you. And how was pricing per -- like end user pricing been tracking over the past year would you say?
James A. Tholen
So, pretty consistent with historical trends. Our hosted pricing, we really been able to maintain pricing in the marketplace. SIP trunking relatively similar kind of adjusting for volume. And to be honest, consumer fixed line, pretty consistent with past trends. On VoLTE, your price per subscriber is lower but, clearly, your volume opportunities are much higher. So it's all to me pretty consistent on a price volume curve.

Our next question will come from the line of Dmitry Netis from William Blair.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Just on the $50 million deal. Jim, I think, you said proportional revenue in Q1, wanted to get some color and how does that compare with the prior guide, which is, I think, you said $10 million in the first half. So if I did the proportional revenue throughout the year, I come out with $4 million in Q1. Would that still signify you're expecting $6 million in the second quarter?
James A. Tholen
No. I think -- so Dmitry, when we originally envisioned it as a -- on the original deal, you may remember, Q3 we announced that Q3 '12, it was a little less than $10 million in software-only and we thought that it would be a onetime revenue event for a cap of 14. We noted last summer that it had expanded and that would be about $15 million in the year. And $3 million to $4 million or more per year -- for several years after that and that it would be ratable across the year. So it's -- so you take $15 million divided by 4 and have it in each quarter, that's going to be a pretty good view of our expectation.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
So $3.75 million throughout the next 4 quarters is what you guiding for?
James A. Tholen
Yes. That's the math.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
And maybe if I could squeeze some more quick ones. One on the OpEx -- well the OpEx, the front -- is it front-loaded for 2014? I think you made a comment I wasn't sure if it's the 2014 or 2013 comment as far as front-loading the OpEx. Are we expecting it to be more front-loaded into 2014? How should we think about that one?
James A. Tholen
Yes, yes. Pretty good sequential bump from Q4 to Q1. And then, pretty muted growth for the rest of the year. Other than kind of the normal stuff you would expect in Q4, the sales guys hit their accelerator and things.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. Great. And I didn't want to leave Mike out as well. So Mike, for you, on this Ericsson announcement, they have launched their fixed mobile IMS apps server. Clearly, Ericsson has a great footprint in the mobile operators space and now they're trying to go into the business space with their hosted UC product. Could you compare, contrast the strength, let's say, of BroadSoft solution versus what they're delivering here?
Michael Tessler
Come on, Dmitry, since you know. It's an announcement. It's so far away from where we are. Let's -- we're 15 years into developing a unified communications solution. So we'll wait a few more quarters to see how real this really is.
All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for being on call today and for your continued support. We look forward to updating you on the progress in the coming months. Thanks. Have a great day.
