Ori Hadomi
Thank you Michael, and welcome to Mazorâs fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call to discuss our record performance. 
This was a landmark year for Mazor as we made significant strides and greatly enhanced our leadership position in the spine market with the implementation of the Medtronic co-marketing and co-promotional agreement in the launch of the transformational Mazor X system.
I will review our performance and the market environment and then provide an update on our strategic plans. As we previously announced on January 4, we received orders for 21 systems in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 75% increase of the year ago fourth quarter. This also represented a second consecutive record quarter with more than 20 system orders, quite outstanding.
For the full year, we received orders for 62 systems, an impressive 138% increase compared to the 2016 order we received in 2015. Of the 62 systems, 15 were ordered by Medtronic, five of which are for the training centers and 10 of which are for Medtronic to install in their customer sites. 
On a global basis, we ended the fourth quarter with 149 systems worldwide with 94 in the United States. This does not take into account the 21 systems in our December 31 backlog. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for that matter the second half of 2016 is a reflection of the market excitement for the Mazor X and the successful execution on the Medtronic co-marketing and co-promotional agreement. The results are apparent.
On the systems side, through the activity of our capital team together with hundreds of Medtronic sales people, our sales pipeline has been broadened. In addition, in the past two quarters, we were able to significantly shorten our sales cycles. Awareness of Mazor and its products have increased due to the co-marketing activities and campaign run by Mazor and Medtronic jointly.
We have for the first time ever received a multisystem order from two first-time hospital customers, who ordered three systems each. Momentum continues to build as surgeons from highly prestigious medical centers across the United States are visiting our [labs]. 
On the innovation side, we continue to see high level of applications by surgeons demonstrating the continued satisfaction with the system and its contribution to positive patient outcome. 
We reported revenues of $14 million in the fourth quarter, a 59% increase compared to the year-ago fourth quarter. The current revenues continue to demonstrate robust growth in the quarter as it increased $4.5 million, which represents a 29% rise compared with the year ago fourth quarter. To date, there has been a cumulative total of over 23,000 procedures utilizing our systems. This experience provides extensive insight into the choice of the customer and creates a vast gap between Mazor and any emerging competition.
We use the tagline align with experience because we believe that one of our major assets and valuable position is our clinical experience that has been accumulated over the years with two previous commercializations of products that have been used in a wide variety of spine cases to place more than 160,000 implants.
Now let me provide more details on the US system order. We received 12 Mazor X orders through a combination of direct Mazor activity and collaboration with Medtronic. As of December 31, 2016, six of these systems were installed at two customer locations in Connecticut and Pennsylvania. We expect to install the remaining systems at the US customers during 2017. 
We also received four trade-in orders for the Mazor X from US customers that are current Renaissance users, and in addition we received orders for three Renaissance systems, of which two were special with the future trade-in option for the Mazor X option.
With regard to the 21 systems in the backlog at December 31, these will be delivered to customers primarily in the Southeast, West and Central plains region of the United States, and six systems will be delivered to Medtronic for installation at customer sites completing the 15 systems orders. Internationally we received two purchase orders for Renaissance systems. One was delivered to our distribution partners in Australia, its fourth Renaissance order in 2016, and the other was delivered to our distribution partner in Thailand, its second system in order in 2016.
In addition, we delivered a third system of the multi-order we received from our distribution partner in China. We ended 2016 with plenty of momentum and I am pleased to report that the enthusiasm remains high as we begin 2017. Our capital sales team working with the sales reps at Medtronic is pursuing numerous leads to further penetrate the market. The interest and feedback since we launched the Mazor X has been exceptional and our order pipeline at the end of the year was at record level.
Our team is working to close several of these over the coming weeks in 2017 first quarter. Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the fourth quarter, I want to review and provide an update on our growth strategies and priorities. We ended the fourth quarter with 20 capital sales reps. As a reminder, at this stage of the agreement, Phase I, Medtronic sales team is only responsible for generating awareness of the Mazor X, bringing surgeons to learn and qualifying leads before handing the leads to our capital sales reps to close the sales.
I want to make clear that our team is still responsible for also generating leads for the Renaissance system and Mazor X. their success contributed to our record second half performance. I believe our current capital sales rep size and team structure allow us to address these deals while also pursuing independent sales for the Mazor X and Renaissance system.
On the clinical side, in addition to supporting the Renaissance systems installed base, they are supporting the new Mazor X cases. As we have said previously, we expect to increase the number of clinical sales reps throughout 2017 to support the successful clinical penetration of the Mazor X system.
Second, we continue to be pleased with the increased utilization of the Renaissance system. For the year ended December 31, 2016 systems in place for more than 12 months averaged 85 procedures compared to the 80 procedures for 2016. This is due to a number of factors, including surgeon acceptance and comfort as they read published reports providing clinical evidence regarding the performance and accuracy of our core technology.
Mazor X was launched in late October with first installation in December. Its utilization rate is following the planned trajectory as we see positive adoption by surgeons. Third on our list of priorities is to deliver product innovation and enhancement, positioning us to provide patient benefit and to maintain our leadership in spine markets. 
During 2017, we expect to commercially launch the [X line] software model and the [Indiscernible]. This is part of our vision of the Mazor X as a platform for growth that will continue to expand to include new features and [Indiscernible]. Additional product innovation is emanating from the Medtronic agreement, where we are cooperating to develop synergistic products utilizing our precision guided surgery know-how, advanced software capabilities and the Medtronic implant product portfolio.
And last, we continue to engage in clinical studies and data collection. 2016 clinical data continued to positively support and provide evidence for the benefit of our core technology versus free hand procedures in terms of reduced [Indiscernible], fewer complication and revision. New findings have been submitted by investigators to key conferences, and we expect to be able to report encouraging new evidence later in the year.
In summary, we proactively defined a number of objectives for 2016 and we successfully executed on all of them. The partnership with Medtronic and the launch of the Mazor X are two key strategic developments that raised our profile and clearly put a lot of distance between Mazor and others developing their own approaches to robotic spine surgery.
The sheer volume of procedures performed over 23,000, and numerous peer-reviewed publications and clinical experience is difficult to match. We continued to move forward to assure that our technologies and products have a qualitative edge to maintain and strengthen our leadership position.
Now, to review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you Ori, and hello everyone. I will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $14 million, an increase of 59% compared to $8.8 million in the year ago fourth quarter. Geographically, revenue in the US was $12.6 million or 90% of total revenue with $1.4 million or 10% of revenue from international markets.
Capital sales revenue was $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an 81% increase compared to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as the company recognized revenue from 13 Mazor X systems and 5 Renaissance systems compared to 12 Renaissance systems in the fourth quarter of 2015.
We started the third quarter with the backlog of 18 systems, of which two were Renaissance systems with exchange options that were not recognized according to GAAP. In the fourth quarter, we received 21 system orders. Delivered and recognized 17 systems and recognized revenue from one additional Renaissance system delivered in Q3, in which the exchange option expired. This left us with a backlog of 21 systems as of December 31, 2016, out of which four are trade-in orders, six are units to be delivered to Medtronic and the remaining systems were ordered by new customers. The company expects to deliver these systems in 2017.
Revenue from disposal kit sales grew to $2.7 million, a 23% increase compared to $2.2 million in the last yearâs fourth quarter, reflecting the increase in our installed base primarily in the US markets. Revenue generated from service and others were $1.8 million compared to $1.3 million in the year ago quarter.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 was 70.5% compared to 78% in the year ago fourth quarter. The decrease in gross margin is mainly attributed to the reduced price of the two Medtronic and higher manufacturing cost of the Mazor X compared to the Renaissance system.
Operating expenses were $14.2 million compared to $9.8 million in the year ago fourth quarter. The increase in expense is primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing. We recruited additional sales and clinical reps and invested in activities relating to Mazor X launch to raise our brand awareness and broaden our sales footprint. 
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the fourth quarter was 4.3 million or $0.09 per share compared to a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was 3.1 million or $0.07 per share compared to 2.1 million or $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Cash used for operating activities in the fourth quarter was 1.9 million compared to 4.3 million in the last yearâs fourth quarter. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is attributed mainly to the high collection from customers often by higher payments to suppliers.
As of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled roughly 62 million. This provides us ample resource to continue the execution of our business plan. 
That concludes my remarks. And I will pass the call back to Ori for summary comments, and then we will take questions. Ori?
Ori Hadomi
Thank you Sharon. We ended 2016 with plenty of momentum. Medtronic is a highly engaged and active partner, and I am pleased to report the enthusiasm being generated both by the relationship and by the Mazor X launch remains high as we begin 2017.
Mazor X defined guidance market leader with clinically proven technology, two spine products and a dedicated partner that shares our vision for the spine market and view our product as a competitive advantage and growth driver for its business. Due to the steps we have taken and the strategy that we adopted, market awareness is at an all time high.
We are confident that this brings 2017 to be a success.
Thank you again for joining the call. Operator, we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will move to Craig Bijou with Wells Fargo.
Craig Bijou
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ori, I want to start with â I appreciate your comments on the pipeline and the shorter sales cycle, so I mean, I guess my question is, typically you have been â you have had pretty good visibility with the Renaissance in the pipeline there. So, with Mazor X coming onboard and the bolus of orders that you saw in Q4, I just want to get an understanding from you how you see the visibility of X system sales, and the comments on the shorter sales cycle, how sustainable is that in the future?
Ori Hadomi
Thank you Craig for the question. First of all, I don't think we had very good visibility with Renaissance. I think one of the issues that we had with Renaissance is that it wasn't very predictable, and if you remember most of our sales took place at the very last two or three days of the quarter. And I think that what we saw with Mazor X is a very different sales cycle and sales process.
What we see is that â and I think the reason for that is the combination of many different factors. It is not only the product. It is the product, it is different. The way the sourcing is managed. It has to do with the partnership with Medtronic, the halo effect of that. That probably also has to do with the environment in the field and what is going on right now in the US. 
So all of this together I think put us in an environment where we have much clearer communication with the [administration], and we are able to progress deals. I think that faster and with a shorter sales cycle relative to what we experienced with Renaissance. I think it is too early now after only one quarter we sold Renaissance to say that, we know exactly what is a sales cycle.
We have indications that it is much shorter. Obviously the numbers are telling it. I remind everyone we launched it on October, and we introduced it in July and we sold more than 20 systems. So it tells something about the sales cycle. But I will conclude from that I don't think it is sufficient that it is enough to make very general conclusion.
Right now, when I am looking at the first quarter and the second quarter I see a very robust pipeline. I see a pipeline that is in line with what we expected and in terms of building our plan for 2017, and I feel comfortable with what I see in front of me. But, the truth is in the pudding. So, we need to wait sometime and see whether if we are able to maintain this sales cycle that we experienced in the second half of 2016.
Craig Bijou
Okay. That is helpful, and if I could just ask on the backlog, I understand that you expect the systems that are in the backlog today to be recognized or to be delivered sometime in 2017, I wondered if we could get a little more specificity on how long you think it would take to deliver those systems. Is it a quarter, is it two quarters, and then maybe just if there is any manufacturing constraints or how we should think about how many Mazor X systems you can deliver in a quarter?
Ori Hadomi
I don't think that we have any real manufacturing constraints. So while right now the ramp up process â it always takes time to build â to ramp up. Right now we are manufacturing, I think it is about two units every week, something like that and should we decide to expand it, we definitely can do it.
We are working â we outsourced the manufacturing and assembly to a subcontractor that have a lot of â have the capacity and the capability to open several production lines, and I don't think we are really limited in our ability to manufacture more. So, in relation to that I don't see any real constraint in the long-term.
As to the recognition and the delivery of the backlog systems, we were not specific in what we said earlier about when we will deliver and how to be recognized because oftentimes we had to deal also with business and marketing considerations of priorities between customers and based on the agreement that we made with the customers about the delivery time. So it was â we welcome â [Indiscernible] we didn't mention when exactly we will deliver these systems.
Craig Bijou
Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you Craig.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Matt Taylor with Barclays.
Matt Taylor
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Ori, I was hoping that after this experience with Medtronic and having really good period of initial orders, you could help us think about I guess how you view the term for the company. So you have got about 100 systems in the US and maybe you could help us to sort of revisit some of your assumptions around which hospitals are most appropriate, and what kind of centers do you think you can target with the tiered offering, and just help us think about how penetrated you are now as you work through the backlog?
Ori Hadomi
I think that what we experienced now is that really with the help of Medtronic we are able to approach and successfully penetrate very big and lucrative centers that we were not able â or let us say, we were not successful in doing it in the past. To what extent it has to do with the product, to what extent it has to do with Medtronic, it is probably the combination of both. And it is a fact that during the fourth quarter as I mentioned earlier, two accounts or the three units and that is for the first time for us and these are first-time customers and these deals have been done with the help of Medtronic.
So, the one thing that didn't happen this quarter is that we didn't sell Mazor X systems to ASCs. I don't think that we will see because the price of the Mazor X â I don't see the Mazor X often accepted by surgery centers even though I do know â I am aware of few surgery centers have expressed interest in us to get the quotation, but I think that this product will most probably be purchased by the community hospitals, academic centers and the most sophisticated ones.
I think that from the type of feedback that we get today from the surgeons in the lab, they are overwhelmed by the capability of this system even after they attended [Indiscernible] and saw it there, when they come to the lab and have hands-on experience with the system, many of them say that they underestimated how significant a contribution and how much it can help and change the way to doing spine surgery.
So I do believe today more than anytime in the past that in spine robotics will become the standard of care. And I think that we are in an era where we will see basically in every sophisticated modern spine operating room a robot. Whether it will take two, three, five or seven years, I don't know to tell you exactly. But I think it will take faster than what I thought in the past that it will take.
And that is what we see now. We see great enthusiasm. We see nice adoption. I think that we need to remember that we are just in the very beginning of the curve and obviously it will take some time to polish and to mature the technology in order for it to be able to be adopted also by the vast majority, and not only by the innovators, but I think what I see is we are in the right track.
Matt Taylor
Okay, and then I guess I just want to circle back on thinking about the backlog and the Medtronic opportunity, I guess can you characterize for us two things, one is as you have started this relationship with Medtronic, do you think we have seen a real bolus or kind of acceleration that was driven by low hanging fruit, maybe the most likely centers to want the system and now that is going to tail off, or do you think it could actually accelerate, I'm just trying to understand what the kind of lead pipeline looks like at this point and whether we have sort of seen the relationships already bear fruit or there is a lot more to come?
Ori Hadomi
I believe that we are just at the very beginning. I think that right now Medtronic is engaged a few of its territories and not all of the territories, and what we see now is basically the results of the effort in these specific areas. The opportunity is much larger, and remember right now they are highly dependent on us. Medtronic is not active, not very engaged in the â closing the deals and the process of administration. They generate leads.
They can generate more. They can generate both in the US more as well as out of US. We are just in the very beginning. And we are also â we don't want to run too fast. We are eager in launching new products to the market. It is very â I don't want to â there is a reason why we decided not to deliver all the systems at the beginning because we felt that we need to control the penetration. We need to get feedback to put improvements and do it in a more gradual and controlled manner.
So, to me right now the volume and the process exceed what I expected and I am very pleased with the progress we are experiencing.
Matt Taylor
Okay. Thank you. 
Ori Hadomi
Thank you. 
Operator
[Operator Instruction] We will go next to Mike Matson with Needham and Company.
Mike Matson
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I was just curious if you can give us an update on the Medtronic implants, the robotics specific implants, is that something that they started to work on developing, is that something that you anticipate seeing in 2017 or is it going to be further out than that?
Ori Hadomi
I cannot talk on behalf of Medtronic. I can tell you what we felt that there will be a synergistic product between Mazor and Medtronic and we will introduce a robotic-guided spine procedures where both companies are committed to this project. We think that it's very important. We also share the vision of doing spine procedures without the k-wires or the wireless spine procedures, and we are definitely working on this and we will launch it when it's ready. 
Mike Matson
Okay understand. And then can you just remind me in terms of how the agreement works with the implants. So the synergy payments is that only on these special implants that are yet to come or do you get payments if they are just using the standard Medtronic implants as well?
Ori Hadomi
Sharon, you want to relate to that?
Sharon Levita
Yes. Based on the agreements for every case where Mazor X will be used whether it's coming from a Medtronic lead or Mazor lead, and they will be Medtronic implants we will get the synergy fee and it's not connected to the future development of implants. 
Mike Matson
Okay. So it's conceivable that you would start receiving that this year then â as the systems get placed andâ¦
Sharon Levita
That is correct.
Mike Matson
Okay. All right. And then can you just give us an update, you may have said this earlier, I apologize I got on the call a little late, but just [plans] for this year with Medtronic, I guess, I don't know if you can quantify the number of courses or surgeons or anything like that but anything you would say would be helpful. Thanks.
Ori Hadomi
I am not sure I understand the question. Are you asking â can you clarify the question please?
Mike Matson
Yes. Just surgeon training, I mean what are your plans this year? How does that compare to last year I guess and number of surgeons, number of courses, whatever anything can say that quantify that I guess will be helpful.
Ori Hadomi
We are holding Bioskills Lab in Celebration, and recently we opened another one also in California. And we are running these courses during Thursday and Friday, almost, I think â not almost but every week. These labs are packed and booked in advance and surgeons are coming all over the country. So if we will need to open more courses we will. Right now we began with only Fridays, and now we expand it also to Thursday. So this tells a little bit about the level of demand. We didn't provide exact numbers about how many surgeons been trained, how many we expect but right now when we look at the new future, we are satisfied with the pipeline of the count and surgeons coming to train.
And most importantly, we know today that this is one of the most effective sales tools. When surgeons have their hands on the system and experience the system [Indiscernible] that's when the time where they make decision and recommend to the administration. So we believe this is one of the most effective sales tools that we have and we will continue to invest in that.
Mike Matson
All right. That's all I have. Thank you. 
Ori Hadomi
Thank you. 
Operator
We have no other questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Ori Hadomi for any additional or closing remarks.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you everyone. Thank you for your interest and trust during 2016, and we are looking forward to a successful 2017. Thank you everyone.
Operator
That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.
