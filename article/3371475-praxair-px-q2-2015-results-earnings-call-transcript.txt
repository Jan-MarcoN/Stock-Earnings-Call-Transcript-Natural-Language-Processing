Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Praxair Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelcey Hoyt, Director-Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Candice. Good morning and thank you for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
In addition, please note that our discussion of earnings for the second quarter, including year-over-year and sequential comparison excludes charges taken this quarter related to cost reduction actions. The reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.
Matt and I will now review Praxair's second quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. We'll then be available to answer questions.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. The global macroeconomic backdrop continues to be quite challenging across major end markets. The combination of fiscal uncertainty, volatile commodity pricing and devaluing foreign currencies has constrained industrial demand and thus our customers' production activity.
This American economy continues to soften as the government limit spending, while fighting inflationary pressures. In North America, we are seeing more negative effects from the curtailment of energy investing, as well as the rapidly appreciating U.S. dollar. And in Asia, the Chinese economy continues to decelerate as it absorbs excess industrial capacity.
The culmination of all of this, result in our year-over-year sales decreasing by 12% this quarter. 9% of the drop is from weaker foreign currencies, another 2% from lower natural gas pass-through. This leaves underlying sales lower by 1% from the second quarter of 2014, as a 1% price improvement is more than offset by a 2% volume decline.
The drivers behind the decline are cyclical in nature. We've seen down cycles before and they eventually recover. However, since it's not clear when they will recover, an important question is what are we doing about it? While we can't control FX rates or the underlying volumes tied to economic conditions, we can manage other aspects of the business to preserve and grow shareholder value.
We are raising price to recover the affects of cost inflation. We achieved 1% global pricing improvement, driven by North and South America, which will support our earnings going forward. We are prudently managing costs to better align our organization with underlying business trends. In this quarter, we took $146 million charge, which included severance for approximately 5% of our global work force, in addition to consolidation or exit of certain business operations.
We expect the actions to be substantially complete by the end of 2015, with annualized savings of about $75 million per year, starting in the fourth quarter. The combined price and cost actions have further improved the quality of the business as evidenced by higher operating and EBITDA margins at 22.9% and 33.4%, respectively.
In addition to the income statement, we are increasing focus on the balance sheet. More disciplined asset management has led to higher free cash flow, enabling us to return over $400 million to shareholders this quarter, while investing for long-term growth and reducing our net debt. And we expect to continue these efforts, as we just announced this morning a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.
So regardless or current economic conditions, we continue to position the business for long-term growth, while remaining a reliable steward of shareholder capital.
I'd now like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.
Kelcey E. Hoyt - Director-Investor Relations
Please turn to slide number 3 for our consolidated results. Overall sales and operating profit this quarter were 1% below the prior year, and EPS grew 2%, excluding negative foreign currency translation impact and cost pass-through.
Sales for the quarter were $2.7 billion. Year-over-year price attainment of 1% was driven primarily by North and South America. Volumes declined 2% as new project contribution was more than offset by weaker underlying industrial activity in Brazil and China, as well as weaker energy, metals, and manufacturing end markets in the United States.
Sequentially, organic sales growth was steady, with most segments in line with or modestly positive, including price, to the first quarter. Operating profit was $626 million. Excluding currency impact, operating profit was 1% below the prior-year period as benefits from higher price were more than offset by lower volumes.
As such, during the quarter, we took incremental cost-reduction actions, primarily in emerging markets to rightsize the cost base and align the organization with the current environment.
Our employees' ability to continually deliver strong productivity, cost control and price grew our EBITDA margin 130 basis points, to 33.4%. And the operating margin 50 basis points to a record 22.9%. Earnings per share of $1.45 increased 2% year-over-year ex-currency. EPS benefited from a 2% reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock.
During the quarter, we repurchased $217 million of stock, net of issuances, or about 2.1 million shares. About $500 million remains available under the current authorized share repurchase program. And this morning we announced the authorization of an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing the total available for repurchases to about $2 billion. This is our fifth share repurchase program initiated since 2007.
And as you can see on slide 12, our consistently strong operating cash flow generation has enabled us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders in the form of annually increasing dividends as well as share repurchases that have reduced the diluted shares outstanding each year. We expect that strong cash flow generation and subsequent cash returns to shareholders will continue throughout the various economic cycles.
Cash flow from operations was $707 million or 26% of sales and funded $352 million of capital expenditures. The company paid $205 million of dividends and repurchased $217 million of stock net of issuances. This aligns with our capital allocation strategy of funding growth and shareholder returns from cash flow. Our after-tax return on capital this quarter remains stable at 12.6% and return on equity was strong at 30.5%.
Our project backlog, which we define as projects with CapEx greater than $5 million and associated with a fully executed customer supply contract, decreased from $2.1 billion in the first quarter to $1.7 billion in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by projects in North America, both the start-up and positive resolution of an energy project in the United States. This energy project has been delayed several years by the customers' lack of a permit. Working collaboratively with the energy customer, we terminated our hydrogen supply agreement and sold the fixed assets under construction to the customer. We did not have a gain or a loss on the settlement.
Geographically, our current backlog CapEx is about 40% weighted towards North America, about 30% in Asia, and the remaining 30% for customers in South America and Europe. These projects will serve a diverse set of end markets, including energy, chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, and metals. Ongoing project bidding globally remains active in downstream energy and petrochemical end markets.
Please turn to slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.5 billion, 9% below the prior-year quarter. 8% of the decline, was driven by lower cost pass-through, largely lower natural gas prices passed through the hydrogen customers and negative currency translation in Canada and Mexico, two countries which comprise more than a quarter of the North American sales.
Organic sales were 1% below the prior year as price attainment in merchant and packaged gas was offset by volume declines. Volume growth to food and beverage and refinery customers was more than offset by year-over-year declines to metals, upstream energy and manufacturing customers. Overall, on-site volumes were steady year-over-year, with solid demand from chemical and refining customers, offset by weaker sales to metals customers, who have been impacted by lower price of commodities and strength of the U.S. dollar.
North American packaged gas organic sales were lower year-over-year, as stable gas volumes were more than offset by weaker hard goods, primarily related to upstream energy customers. Sequentially, North American organic sales were steady as growth in merchant carbon dioxide to food and beverage customers and hydrogen to refineries was offset by weaker metals and hard goods volumes. North American operating profit was $388 million, consistent with the prior-year quarter, excluding negative currency translation impact.
Price, productivity and cost reduction actions offset the impact of lower volumes. Segment operating margin was strong at 26.2%. During the quarter, we continued to build out density in North America by strengthening our carbon dioxide network and acquiring three U.S. packaged gas distributors. Praxair has signed a long-term agreement to purchase crude carbon dioxide from an existing refinery customer.
Praxair will build, own and operate a 450 ton per day carbon dioxide purification and liquefaction plant, producing beverage-quality liquid carbon dioxide for distribution into the Northeast U.S. market. This new carbon dioxide source, which will begin serving food and beverage and other customers in 2016, further strengthens Praxair's supply position as well as developing a sustainable use of byproduct carbon dioxide.
We still see a healthy pipeline of activity for U.S. packaged gas distributor acquisitions, although potential targets are smaller in size. During the quarter, we acquired three independent distributors of industrial and specialty packaged gases in California, Texas and Maryland with combined 2014 annual sales of about $10 million.
Now please turn to page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $331 million, 19% below the prior-year quarter. Ex-currency and cost pass-through, organic sales growth was 1% below the prior year as growth in manufacturing, food and beverage and healthcare was offset by lower energy end market sales in Northern Europe. Sequentially, organic sales growth of 3% was driven by growth in most countries and end markets and includes a new project startup in Russia. Operating profit of $63 million was steady with the prior-year quarter excluding currency translation, as price and productivity offset the impact of lower volumes. The operating margin remained solid at 19%.
Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $388 million, 3% above the prior-year quarter ex-currency and cost pass-through. Strong price of 7% year-over-year included significant recovery of high inflation in the region.
While South America volumes declined 4% year-over-year, the business again outperformed estimated quarterly industrial production of negative 8%. The local team continues to capture growth in non-cyclical end markets, such as healthcare, and through application technology-driven sales, which was more than offset by lower volumes to manufacturing and metals customers. Sequential volume declines were also driven primarily by metals and manufacturing end markets.
Operating profit in South America was $81 million, in line with the prior-year quarter excluding foreign currency impact, as price gains were offset by lower volumes and higher power costs.
Our local employees continue to take action in both pricing and cost reduction to preserve the operating profit and cash flow generation of the South American business. As a result, we fully expect the profitability to improve when the economy does recover.
Please turn to slide 7 for our results in Asia. Asia sales for the quarter were $387 million, with organic growth of 1% year-over-year. We continue to see mid to high-single digit volume growth in India and Korea, including growth from new plant startups, primarily to metals and electronics customers.
China volume growth continues to decelerate due to slowing industrial activity in most end markets. Sequentially, volumes grew 6%, which includes rebound from the seasonal Lunar New Year impact and new project contribution. Price was steady year-over-year, as increases in Korea and India were offset by continued price pressure in China.
Asia's operating profit was $69 million, lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to negative currency translation and a prior-year insurance recovery benefit of $4 million. As industrial activity has continued to decelerate, primarily in China, we have taken incremental cost reduction actions in Asia in the second quarter to better align the cost base with volume trends.
Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page 8. Surface Technology sales for the quarter were $150 million, 6% below the prior year excluding currency. During the second quarter, organic sales to the energy end market, which is about a quarter of the sales for the segment, were lower year-over-year.
In addition, while aerospace sales grew organically by 2%, this was partially offset by customer plant interruptions, which impacted our volumes. The customers are currently back up and running, but not yet back to expected run rates.
Operating profit of $25 million decreased versus the prior-year quarter due to negative foreign currency translation and lower volume partially offset by cost control.
And now I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our earnings guidance.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Please turn to slide 9. Looking to the third quarter, we are calling for an EPS guidance range of $1.42 to $1.49. This includes an estimated 12% negative impact from foreign currencies. At this point, we aren't anticipating much volume improvement between second quarter and third quarter, although we will start seeing cost benefits from our recent restructuring action by the fourth quarter.
For full year, we've adjusted our guidance downward to a range of $5.80 to $5.95. You can see the EPS walk comparing this to our guidance last quarter. South American volumes continue to decline across major industrial end markets. And North American manufacturing is softening, especially in the U.S., as the effects of lower oil and a stronger dollar are starting to work through the manufacturing base.
Clearly, we're disappointed in the need to adjust guidance again, but the first half of 2015 has been challenging to say the least. Broad-based declines across virtually every commodity class has significantly dampened capital investments from our customers and rippled through the entire supply chain. Emerging market growth continues to soften, with certain countries experiencing recessionary like conditions. Most governments have been focused on improving their balance sheet and thus reducing infrastructure investments. All these macro events have negatively shaped and influenced the investment confidence of our customer base and, hence, slowed growth trends.
However, there are reasons to be confident going forward. We have a strong team of dedicated employees who know how to manage through these cycles. Our organization has and will continue to respond to tough times. And the proof is in our results. We expect to continue to improve upon our industry-leading results now and going forward.
In addition, these global macroeconomic issues are a natural part of the economic cycle. We sell into a wide variety of industries and applications and they tend to move with general economic trends. And right now, we're in a down cycle. So we are focusing on the basics, managing what we can control, and positioning ourselves for a strong recovery. We know how to do this as evidenced by our history. And when the economic cycle recovers, we'll emerge as a stronger and even higher quality company.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thank you. Matt, on slide 11, you show your margin trends since 2008. And obviously, you've had very good trends this year, even with a slowdown in business. So wondering how much of the improvement in operating and EBITDA margins you would attribute to lower natural gas pass-through, particularly in North America?
And then also looking at these margin trends, what do you think the implications are when volumes do turn? Do you have to bring some cost back into the business? Or should operating leverage increase these margins?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So first, Don, on the natural gas impact, I think you can actually go back and calculate those from what we've disclosed in prior presentations. But just focusing now on kind of the current quarter, a portion of the improvement was due to natural gas, but we also picked up probably an extra 10 basis points or so just on price actions and cost actions. So we still are getting what I'll call real improvement in the operating and EBITDA margins, despite, as you can imagine, every time you lose volume that takes away at a pretty heavy margin. So you need to do things around cost, price to make that up. And I think our teams around the world have done a great job on that.
And I think your second question, if you can repeat that again?
Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Yeah. Just wondering when volumes do start to recover, what are the implications for operating leverage? Or do you think you have to bring additional cost back into the business to capture those volumes? Just wondering how much ability you have just to load up existing business?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So I think regarding that one, clearly, we have capacity. So we're not going to need to add capacity. We still have the drivers making the deliveries. We still have the tanks that are at our customers' site, and we still have the pipelines connected to our customers. So when the molecules flow at a greater rate, it's going to be the same cost infrastructure used to deliver them. So I do expect us to see some pretty good margin accretion.
The one area where â if you're below MTOPs, obviously, you don't get to really get that impact until you go above the MTOPs. So there'll be some pockets in South America will need to cross over the MTOP levels. But aside from that, I think merchant and package it's highly accretive right when it happens. And on on-site, once you pass the MTOPs. But we really don't need to add many costs back to achieve that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Matt. Hi, Kelcey.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Hi, Mike.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
You know, Matt, it's been, wow, probably since 2008, 2009 we've seen down volumes for Praxair. You gave us a couple of reasons why. Can you maybe walk through some of the distribution channels? I wonder if tonnage is â are customers getting down to the 70% level? Or are you worried about customers idling plants at this point?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Mike. So you're right. I mean, you're probably going back to 2009. I think when we look across this year, we still do expect, on a volume basis, kind of flat to maybe slightly up. So this quarter was a little bit more of a difficult comp, but clearly, negative 2% on volume. We still are getting some positive contribution on projects, but that's offset by even more erosion on some of the base.
And when you look around the world, probably half of this erosion was North America. And the main elements of that, a little over a third is on-site, when you back out the impact of new projects, a lot of that's metals. And we had a strong metals last year. We saw a big soft patch on the pipeline here this second quarter. We are seeing that pick up a bit in the third quarter. So hopefully that should improve here sequentially, but that was a big driver.
In addition, in North America, the merchant that's serving upstream energy, as well as metals â we serve a lot of argon into stainless steel and liquid oxygen that would go as supplemental oxygen for carbon steel plants, and that is lower.
And in addition, hard goods were lower in North America, high-single digits. And part of that is we have a lot of large equipment sales, mostly in upstream energy last year. And we're seeing that really soften, the equipment sales. And as you can imagine, we're only going to sell hard goods when it makes economic sense for us. We're a gas player and the hard goods are complementary. So there is some business that if it just doesn't make economic sense for us, we're not serving. But we're definitely seeing some slowdown in hard goods.
South America is driving almost a full percent of the volume globally, and that's just due to the function of the economic situation there. As Kelcey had mentioned, we are doing better than the underlying IP, but it's still quite negative. So that's also putting a drag.
And then finally, I'd say Asia is just not growing, China specifically, at the rate we're normally used to. We've seen some positive improvement on merchant, but really, we're still in the process of doing more direct merchant sales and less distributor. And our on-sites were a little slower this quarter here. We had an outage or two, but that was also dragging a bit on that growth.
So I think some of these things are just on-site customers that are either managing their inventories or taking lower volumes. Some are more specific to the energy market, with some of the liquid that was going upstream. But I expect it should get a little bit better here in the back half, but we're not anticipating by a lot, frankly.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just one quick follow-up, I think one positive is you're able to get pricing in this environment, which is pretty impressive. Could you maybe talk about the initiatives there and why in most areas that continues to be a plus for you?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. Clearly, the biggest contributor of price being South America right now. You're seeing a lot of inflation as the government is continually trying to combat that inflation, whether its wage inflation, power inflation, across the board. So we've got pretty strong contracts and a team down there that knows how to recover that inflation. So that is something that's driving our price. We're also seeing some good opportunities still in North America. We've had a few price announcements here recently. And for the most part, they are sticking. So I think that aspect is good. China is still very challenged. And I think in Europe, we're starting to see some positive momentum. You look at our Europe segment is being a little dampened by our energy business. But peeling that out, we're starting to see some good traction in Europe, each quarter a little bit better than the last both in volume and price.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Morning, Liz.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Morning, John.
Elizabeth T. Hirsch - Vice President & Controller
Hi, John.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Was the U.S. energy project divestment, is there a trend there or something we might learn from that particular transaction?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. No. It's very unique. And maybe I can comment a little more on that. So we initiated this contract over eight years ago, and we went into this arrangement with a concept of building our density as we do and a model that we could build out and essentially establish the type of supply that we normally do.
Due to reasons unrelated to us, frankly, customers permitting issue, this delayed for seven, eight years and our equipment essentially was in storage, we had been receiving some progress in recovery payments to sort of help recover our lost time value money. But now the permit's finally been issued, it is modified. And the scope has been changed on this project. And basically, the original project that we had signed up for is just not feasible from our perspective.
So we had worked with the customer, and we felt this was in the best interest in the use of this capital was to go ahead and exercise this opportunity to sell the asset back to the customer. So a very unique situation, I mean, clearly, U.S.-based downstream energy type project is something you would want, today's environment for growth. There's no doubt about that. But I think, as you could imagine, John, we really researched this and analyzed it, thought long and hard about it over the last several years. But we firmly are confident that this is the best use of shareholder capital was to go ahead and exercise this opportunity here the way we did.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
And then as a follow up, you've got a backlog of $1.7 billion, and CapEx of $1.6 billion, roughly the same. Do you expect them to trend stable together for the next few quarters and track each other? Or maybe backlog trends up first and CapEx trends down a little bit? Or how would you see them playing out?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, I think from a CapEx perspective, depending upon the timing of where the projects are, I still think this kind of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and, hence, we're saying $1.6 billion number, seems to be where we're at given the backlog of projects, although we are taking some actions on non-large growth projects to maybe trim a little more.
As far as the backlog, as you know, it's lumpy. We still have some pretty solid leads mostly on downstream either energy or petchem type projects that we're pursuing. They are a little bit larger. So if they are executed and signed, they could create some lumpiness on the upside.
And as far as the downside on the backlog, we've got two more projects that'll be starting up here this year. And then into next year, we have several more coming on stream. So all-in, I still think $1.5 billion to $2 billion on the backlog for the remainder of this year. And then I think CapEx will probably be in the lower end of that range, just given the spend rate.
John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. This is Dan Rizzo in for Laurence. Just to return to that energy products divestiture, what kind of operating cash flow or embedded CapEx could we think about being associated with that project?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, we didn't disclose that number. But I think if you look at the dip in the project backlog, there were three projects that came out this quarter. That one was by far the largest. In our investing cash flow, there was a divestiture line that comprised a large component of this settlement. As I had mentioned before, there were some prior payments over the last eight years. But in the end of the day, it was an energy project that we essentially just sold out from and you can kind of look at the numbers and figure it out.
Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC
All right. Thanks. And then given the shale build-out of the U.S. over the next couple of years, how should we be thinking about CapEx in 2016 and 2017, be lower or higher or equal to 2015?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, specific to the Gulf in the U.S., I expect the opportunities are still fairly strong. When you look globally for us, clearly there'll be some softening in places like China, South America. We're just not seeing large capital projects in places like Europe either. So on a global basis, I would expect it to be a little bit lower. But in the Gulf and in some other pockets of the world in downstream energy, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some good opportunities still. And that's a lot of either national oil companies or independent oil companies looking to take advantage of low-cost feedstock, whether it be oil or, in the petchem side, could be shale.
So I think from that perspective, it's still pretty good opportunities in the Gulf. And I do expect projects related to U.S. Gulf or energy and chemicals will probably make a larger percentage up of our backlog than it does today.
Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC
All right. Thank you, guys.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President

Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, Matt and Liz.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Hey, David.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Matt, just on the pricing, you announced a 10% price increase roughly January 1. You announced a 15% price increase June 1. Obviously, you don't get all these price increases in on the bulk side; they take years to fully implement. Can you help us think about how these combined pretty lofty price increases will flow through? Is it 1% to 2% per year? Is it higher? Just help us on the pricing issue.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. I think, David, when you look at North America, say, when we talk about price, we're really talking about merchant and package. So while the denominator is the entire sales of the segment, the actual price itself in the numerator is just for those two portions of the business. So the first thing you could probably do, and this is all disclosed information, but you can kind of back into what the price is just on the two distribution methods that it applies to.
And then when looking at that, you're exactly right. I mean, we are a contractual business. So pricing will be applied to where contracts allow. And you'll have a hit rate that can vary, depending upon regions and contracts and markets. But we are usually able to always get a few percent out of each price increase that we announce. And that's kind of how our stick rate's been over our history.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just on the cost action, Matt, I think you targeted $30 million of the $75 million in Brazil. What's your expectation for Brazil going forward? Is it shrinking this year? Or is it your expectation it shrinks next year as well? Are these cost actions reflective of just, obviously, a lower growth, if not declining economy going forward?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So really that's if you can imagine a macro kind of question as the macros are really what are having Brazil struggle. But from our just best guess at this point â and I was just down there about a month ago, clearly, 2015 is challenged. The view is that there's not a lot of optimism around 2016 yet at this point. Inflation is the big culprit they're really trying to get after. And they just recently made a change here and their fiscal deficit had to sort of step it down. But they are going after the government balance sheet and I think that part is positive. They're just not getting the tax revenue base.
So when you add all these pieces together, I just don't think the confidence is yet there. Clearly, the confidence on the current ruling party is quite low right now. So I think that is creating a challenge for investors to want to invest at this point. Now, the reais has gotten fairly weak here. And so that does make exporting beneficial for those that can do it today.
So my best guess at this point is I'm not really expecting a lot out of Brazil the rest of this year or into 2016. We're kind of thinking it may just hold flat. But if they can continue to take the actions they're taking, it should bode well for them to start stimulating the economy back end of 2016 possibly. It just remains to be seen. But the SELIC rate is quite high right now. So they have a lot of room to stimulate, they just are not comfortable with their inflation situation. And I agree with that.
So we're going to have to wait and see. But we're not waiting in terms of our rightsizing the organization. We're aligning it more with the near-term outlook, which is muted, and we're just rightsizing the organization around this. But when things recover, we won't miss anything. We're still very, very well positioned to capture more than our fair share when things recover.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is now open.

Good morning, Matt, Kelcey and Liz. How are you?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning, Sam.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Many of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple of clarifications ones, Matt, when you and Steve have talked in the past about projects having been in dispute, was this what you were referring to specifically, the backlog project that you're announcing has been divested? Was that what you were referring to?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And by my â I just want to make sure my math is correct. China, you're mentioning is decelerating, but it would appear at least though that the volumes are running down high single. Is that how we should look at it? Or is there a different way you're classifying the volumes when you're talking about China?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. I think you got to peel out the project start-ups, as they may be a little different than the underlying economic trends. But at least what I'm seeing when I look at China, you're kind of low-single digit, maybe mid-single digit in certain parts of the country right now is what we're seeing on the ground.
And I think what you've got going on there is a lot of the very large growth opportunities in either infrastructure, anything upstream whether it's steel, mining, construction, those are clearly softer and they were driving a lot of the growth.
Downstream is still okay whether it's consumer related, environmental, food, healthcare. But those are just not as intensive in terms of gas usage. So what I would characterize it as is we're still seeing good growth in these more consumer downstream opportunities. And we signed that CNOOC deal last quarter, I think as evidence. But the upstream side is definitely softer and there's just, frankly, excess capacity. I mean, that's one of the main issues is there's just too much capacity and it needs to be soaked up.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Final question if I could, and this is going to be an odd question, I guess, to ask on quarterly conference call. But I guess we're all trying to figure where the base level of business might get to, to figure out where things might stabilize. If you ended up keeping all else equal and all of your long-term contractual business went to take-or-pay levels, would the overall company be earning its cost of capital, keeping everything else equal?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, a third of our business is on-site. So that third has the take-or-pay levels. The other two-thirds are merchant and packaged. So they would be requirements contracts, but not all of them by any means have any take-or-pay form.
But I'll answer it this way. I feel quite good about our on-site projection in down environments. And I think if you want to use history as an example, just look in 2009 when things really fell. I mean, really fell, and they really fell fast, as you may recall. And we were pretty resilient. And a lot of that were the contracts, a lot of that was the protection in the on-site. So I feel fine on that front. And I think you're seeing it play out in Brazil today. We're still maintaining a pretty high quality business in what several are calling some of the worst conditions in over two decades. So I feel okay on that.
Now, the merchant and package, clearly that's going to be a little more exposed, especially the package in terms of what's going on in the environment. So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's about the best way I can characterize it.
Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I could certainly re-ask that question offline, but that is very helpful. Thank you, Matt. I appreciate it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Morning, Bob.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Matt, I'm just curious, as the sort of the transition of some of these emerging markets maybe away from some of the commodity boom of the past decade as they mature, do you see the multiplier on your business or in the industry in general changing at all? Or do you think, as you've done in the Western economies where you get other avenues of growth, you can still continue to grow at some multiplier GDP?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, I think, Bob â and that is a good question. I think the multiplier is a function of this intensity per capita concept, right. That really helps drive a higher multiplier in terms of gas pull-through on the growth. And in the emerging markets, they still have fairly low levels of gas intensity per capita. You just see it in the results and you see it when you go to those countries in terms of how their â the lack of application technology that's being deployed.
So I still think the multipliers are quite strong in those regions. I just think the challenge you're seeing in a lot of emerging markets today is the investments are just simply not being made. All right so people made investments in some of these markets and the capacities are lower than they expect, so they're just running with existing capacity or, in some cases, just not running that capacity and that's the bigger challenge.
But you look at certain countries that still have significant infrastructure needs and they're just putting a lot of that on hold to try and get the government balance sheet corrected. When they get back to a situation of addressing those infrastructure needs, I think you'll see that multiple back in play, and we should be in pretty good shape in terms of gas pull-through.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. And I know you can't and wouldn't talk specifically about any competitors. But I'm just wondering if you could â have you seen any change in the bidding activity? You've got a domestic competitor that's got a culture change going on. Maybe you've got some European competitors that have weak currency benefits. The industry is in a lull. Have you sensed any change in competitive dynamics as those fewer, maybe more worthy or more exciting projects that are still left out there are put up for bid, has that changed the intensity around it?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, I think, Bob, there's only been a few data points, given the geographies that we participate in. And I'd say at this point, there's nothing I can really point to, to say either direction I've seen anything materially different. But we'll probably just need more evidence and more time to just understand that.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks for the help.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Harrison of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Morning, Mike.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC
Matt, was wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's driving the strength in the food and beverage market? It's been a little while since we got an update on how you're leveraging the new CO2 business. I know they had some opportunities in beer as well as in Latin America. Are those starting to come to fruition?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yes. In fact, Mike, we're taking not just the growth in new CO2 in the U.S. and expanding it in other applications and leveraging our packaged business to support that. But we're deploying that model in other countries. So South America, Mexico and some other parts of the world, we're really trying to duplicate some of those efforts and leveraging our strong CO2 supply network and very strong food and beverage application technology.
So we're doing that to continue to grow. We are seeing some opportunistic acquisitions that we've done in LATAM around food. So I think that's been a good driver for us. And it's something that has a nice sort of Brazilian noncyclical aspect that meshes well with our portfolio and meshes well with our application expertise.
So we've been quite happy with that. And Kelcey mentioned in the prepared remarks another CO2 supply that we've acquired here in the U.S. and that'll further help some of our synergies and our growth opportunities in that market.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC
And then I had a couple things to ask about the steel outlook. It sounds like you're a little bit more positive on what's going on in North America on the dynamics. But could you just walk through kind of each region and what you see in terms of trends or anything â any positive signs region to region? And then are you seeing any impact from weaker steel demand on supply and demand balance for argon?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay. So first I'll talk about the base carbon steel. Just on North America as well, while I feel a little better this quarter, we were coming off some pretty low lows in Q2. So I think it's â while the sequential I feel a little better on, whether there are levels that we've seen or normalized levels remains to be seen. But it does appear to be better so far. I think Q2, there were just more customer outages and excess inventory overhang.
Looking at South America, it's hard to say. I think the only â auto is still very weak in South America. Infrastructure projects, as I mentioned, are just not happening. So whether it's long steel, flat steel, there's just not very much demand. I think one positive aspect is the way that currencies are going, especially when you look at a country like Brazil. Their export market should start to open up a bit. Their steel is definitely becoming more competitive. But aside from that, the demand in South America, I think is still a bit constrained, given the end markets.
India, we're still seeing some good opportunities. We've had a few announcements here and we're working with some of the large steel makers there. So I think, in balance, that one has been a good story.
China is just a story of excess capacity. It's well known the government has made very explicit efforts to try and reduce that capacity. We welcome that. I think it's just been very slow going for that capacity to be reduced. So until that happens and those mills are closed that are kind of really fringe mills, second and third tier, I just don't think that situation will be fixed anytime soon.
And in Europe, what we're seeing is if you have the mills, you're running them. And we're seeing some customers run them fairly hard. But I wouldn't expect much incremental investments in Europe at this point. But that remains to be seen.
And as far as the argon, I think argon always is naturally tight. We're just not seeing the high levels sustainments that we had seen in the prior quarters for some of the production rates. It does go up and down, but in this particular quarter, we just didn't see the type of rates we've seen in the past few quarters.
Michael J. Harrison - Global Hunter Securities LLC
All right. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, with the weak volumes, if you could update us on where you're seeing merchant utilization rates around the world?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure, James. Starting in North America, high 70%s, and that's a little bit down from last quarter and it's partly due to some of the things we'd mentioned with manufacturing argon and just further erosion in some of the upstream oil.
South America is still kind of those mid-80%s range. And as I mentioned last call, a lot of it is going into the non-cyclical industries. So fairly resilient merchant supplies there. Europe is low, mid-70%s. We are, as I mentioned, starting to see some uptick. So while the energy business is quite down, the base underlying and manufacturing is picking up. And we're especially seeing that more in the packaged side of the business. And Asia, it's a little bit different depending upon the country. On balance, we're probably mid-70%s. But Korea still quite high. India is low, but that's just due to some capacity it started up. We're loading that capacity as we speak. And then China is a little low just given partly the overcapacity and partly our concerted effort to transition from distributor sales to direct sales. So that's kind of around the world. Not a lot of change from last quarter. But we clearly have ample capacity to rebound when demand presents itself.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Very good. And also if you could just comment a little bit about the chemicals end market. We saw weaker chemicals growth this quarter than even energy. I was wondering if you could just flesh that out a little bit more. I take it that's all in North America. Is that a temporary lull, do you think? Or what's going on in chemicals?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. And, yeah, North America is really driving that number, to your point. And there's a couple pieces. One, consistent with what we had said in the last call, natural gas, while we exclude the pass-through, is impacting that number a bit as we have it embedded in some of the pricing of the co-products that we have, so CO, methanol, certain products, steam. So that is negatively impacting that as natural gas has dropped almost 40% year-over-year.
There also were some outages in North America and it's impacting, frankly, our packaged business even more so than either on-site or merchant. And that has also negatively impacted that. So I would say a good portion to this is temporary in terms of some of the outages in the natural gas. But overall, there might be a little bit of softening in chemicals. As you see oil drop, I think the end products of some of these chemical customers are going to be a little squeezed, their margins. And I think you're starting to see that in some of the chemical companies' recent reports and outlook. So I think there is a little bit of softening happening there.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Very good. And finally, on Mexico, could you just update us on the situation with Pemex? How do you see activities developing in Mexico?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, activity is pretty low still. Their oil output has continued to drop. They're still going through some belt tightening in terms of balancing their fiscal books. So from that perspective, not much improvement. Now, the rest of Mexico is actually performing quite well. Automotive is very strong. The peso hit MXN 16.30 the other day, which is making their exports extremely competitive, especially when added to their labor costs.
So certain markets continue to do quite well. But the Pemex and oil market really just has not improved here. And I think until there's some investments that are brought in, whether it's third party investments or partnerships that Pemex may have, it's hard to find when this is going to turn. But we have heard that there might be some budget loosening here, which would bode well for more wells to be drilled. But at this point, we're not really anticipating much of that.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. Wonder if you could just touch quickly on helium, on how that's being impacted by the slowdown globally and how supply/demand operating rates and pricing trends are handling there?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. Helium is definitely looser than it was a year ago. You had a combination of more sources coming on coupled with customers being much more conservative in how they're using helium, whether it's more helium reclamation projects, some small, very limited but small substitution where feasible.
So what you've seen is I think the helium market went from being very tight to in balance to now you've probably got a little bit more supply than demand. And you're especially seeing that in some of the electronic sectors in Asia. So that is on a volume basis part of the Asia challenge as well.
But I think from a sourcing perspective, we're still very comfortable with our â we have a very broad level of sourcing that's got a pretty good average cost that we can still be competitive in the market. So still a very good business for us. It just goes in these cycles of being very tight to not tight. And I'd say right now it's more than imbalanced and it's created a bit of a headwind year-over-year in volumes given that.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then I believe maybe Kelcey in her prepared remarks mentioned that you guys were starting up a plant in Russia or did this quarter. Can you just kind of walk us through how you're thinking about the strategy there given the geopolitical stuff? And how are the assets that you have there running and cash flowing versus expectations?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So first as far as the assets, we're running them quite hard actually. We've been loading the assets much quicker than expected. The two on-site ones were strict facility fee approaches, but they're both running quite well right now. So from the perspective of if you're in the country and you have the assets, we're actually running them quite well. I think to your point, the geopolitical situation is challenging in the sense of we just don't know looking forward where it'll go. The country, Russia, itself is facing stagflation right now. But all in all, I'd say we're still fairly happy with what we have on the ground there. I think the bigger question for us is incremental investments we just need to be cautious on.
But we're still looking, and we're still pursuing opportunities there. We're just even more selective, I'd say, than we have been. And frankly, the contracts and the way we establish them coming into Russia several years ago have really played out well for us. And not just protection from the ruble, but also just some of the terms and conditions around some of the uncertainties that you face in this country. So I would say while we were a bit disappointed on some of the execution costs and overruns we had in building, the actual demands have played out fairly well. And it's still a geography that we're intensely looking at for growth.
Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Welcome. I think we have time for one more.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Matt, I think your current debt to EBITDA, or net debt-to-EBITDA level is about 2.5 times. Do you think it should be higher or lower, or are you at exactly the right spot?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Jeff, I think first just from the calculation itself, as you can imagine, a substantial portion of our debt is dollar-based. Now we just did two euro issuances. But for the most part that debt is dollar-based. And the EBITDA is more than half, as foreign currency impact. So right now that metric is being a little bit stressed because of foreign currencies and it is thus being inflated a bit because of foreign currencies. So I sort of look at more retained cash flow, some of my kind of coverage ability and a few different metrics in addition to that one.
But all in all, I would answer your question as such that I'm fairly comfortable with our net debt levels. We did increase debt a little bit in Q1. We decreased debt a little bit in Q2. But I am fairly comfortable that where we're at is not an issue either way. And if we see some opportunities, we may raise debt a little bit, whether it's for growth or buybacks, but nothing that material either direction.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then lastly, your restructuring charge was $146 million. I take it that that's probably all cash in that it seems that it's dedicated to severance. And (58:33) looks like...
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. I'm sorry. Just to clarify, no, it's not all cash. It's about half. You'll see it in the Q. We do break out cash and noncash, about half is cash.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Well, the reason why I thought it was more cash is you said that this was a 5% employee reduction. Wouldn't that be about 1,400 people? And wouldn't $75 million or so as a cash charge be too small for that magnitude of 5% head count reduction?
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No. I think with this charge, a little over two-thirds were in the emerging markets.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
Matthew J. White - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
So China, Brazil, so when you do that math of the average salary, you do need to take into consideration, this is a U.S. dollar number on emerging market foreign currency salaries.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you so much.
