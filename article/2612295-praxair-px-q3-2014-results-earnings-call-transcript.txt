Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Kelcey E. Hoyt
Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, and thank you for attending our third quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Matt White, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.
Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.
In addition, please note that quarterly and full year year-over-year guidance comparisons include adjustments in 2013 and the reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the Appendix to this presentation and the press release.
Matt and I will now review Praxair's third quarter results, including the current business environment and updated earnings guidance. At the end of the prepared remarks, we'll be available to answer questions. [Operator Instructions]
Matthew J. White
Thanks, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair delivered record earnings per share of $1.62, and again delivered a solid quarter with year-over-year sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 6%, excluding currency. We achieved a 2% price improvement globally. Trends are improving in the U.S. and India, where we are very well-positioned to capture our fair share of the growth.
In more challenged countries, we will continue to prudently manage our costs and take actions consistent with prior years. This relentless focus on cost management enabled us to reduce our SG&A spending levels and improve our operating margins from the prior year quarter.
We generated strong operating cash flow of 23% of sales, which enabled us to fund our growth capital and returned almost $300 million to our shareholders without impacting our debt levels. While we had a solid third quarter, we continue to face challenging macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. The energy market in Mexico has not yet recovered to levels we're accustomed to, given the continued government budgetary constraints. Brazil and Italy are in technical recessions and China growth has been decelerating. Overall, most emerging markets have not been growing to their potential.
Developed markets, with the exception of the U.S., had been only moderately growing at best. Commodity pricing has been unpredictable, which impacts the investment confidence and timing of our customer base. And now, we are see seeing significant devaluations of most foreign currencies. The cumulative effect of these events has led to a reduction in our fourth quarter earnings guidance.
And while it may be difficult to be bullish on emerging markets right now, I'm confident in Praxair's ability to continue to generate attractive margins and healthy free cash flow in these difficult conditions. We'll continue to manage the things that have enabled our industry-leading position, which include operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. And when these markets do recover, we will not miss a beat. In fact, we will be rewarded with higher accretive earnings since our productivity efforts will make us leaner.
So in summary, all of these factors result in Praxair still being the best-performing industrial gas company, and we expect to stay that way.
And now, I'd like to hand it off to Kelcey to walk through the financial results.
Kelcey E. Hoyt
Thanks, Matt. Please now turn to Slide #3 for our consolidated results. Sales for the quarter were $3.1 billion; and organic growth excluding currency of 5% came primarily from higher price across all operating segments and higher volumes, including new plant start-ups in the Americas and Asia.
Sales growth was stronger in the manufacturing, food and beverage and health care end markets. Sequentially, sales grew 2% ex currency from higher volumes in North America, South America and Asia, partially offset by seasonally lower volumes in Europe.
Operating profit was $711 million, 5% above the prior year quarter. Excluding currency, operating profit growth of 6% was driven by higher volume, price, productivity gains and fixed cost management. The EBITDA and operating margins were strong and grew to 32.5% and 22.6%, respectively.
Net income of $477 million grew 6% from the prior year, greater than operating profit growth, as higher interest expense was more than offset by growth in equity affiliate income, primarily in Asia, and less noncontrolling interest due to the acquisition earlier this year of the remaining noncontrolling interest in a U.S. packaged gas distributor.
Our key leverage metrics including the debt-to-capital ratio increased sequentially to 55.7% despite higher net income through the impact of negative currency translation on the capital base, while the debt-to-EBITDA ratio slightly improved to 2.2x.
Earnings per share of $1.62 were 7% above the prior year and grew faster than net income due to a 1% reduction in a number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of net repurchases of common stock. $1.3 billion remains available under the current $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Cash flow from operations were strong at $713 million. This funded $436 million of capital expenditures and acquisitions to support growth.
During the quarter, we paid dividends of $189 million and repurchased $100 million worth of stock, net of issuances. Our after-tax return on capital this quarter was 12.6%, consistent with the first and second quarters of this year. We expect return on capital to improve as earnings grow. For the quarter, our return on equity was 28.2%.
Our profit backlog is currently $1.9 billion and well-diversified across all geographies, with roughly 1/3 of the CapEx investment in North America, 1/3 in Asia and the remainder in South America and Europe. These projects will serve a balanced set of customers in the energy, chemical, manufacturing, electronics and metals industries.
In addition to the existing backlog projects, we are developing new opportunities to fuel growth with the constant goal of building density and obtaining synergies between the new and base business. The more active bidding regions currently include India and the U.S. Gulf Coast. Opportunities exist in the energy, manufacturing, metals and chemicals end markets.
These potential projects tend to be large for our customers as well as Praxair and are taking longer to close. Customers are reviewing their refreshing cost estimates for their own plant economics, especially given high cost of construction in certain geographies and ever-changing macro conditions. The timing of when these potential projects will be added to our backlog varies. Some projects are in contract negotiation for final terms and conditions, and others are still in the early phase of the bid process. As such, we still expect that the backlog could go up or down in a quarter, depending on the exact timing of final contract execution and existing backlog project start-ups.
In addition, our small on-site plant growth platform for new plants that are too small to be included in the backlog is currently at about $60 million in CapEx, with a little more than 15 projects under long-term contracts that will start up over the next 12 months. The majority of existing projects are located in North and South America, with additional opportunities globally.
Please turn to Slide 4 for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.6 billion, 3% above the prior year quarter, and up 4%, excluding negative currency translation. Organic sales growth of 2% was driven by higher pricing and volume growth in United States and Canada. Sales grew to manufacturing, metals, food and beverage and healthcare markets.
Higher energy-related sales in the United States and Canada were mostly offset by weaker energy sales in Mexico. As of the third quarter, both significant hydrogen project start-ups have now been running for a year. One having started in June and one in August, and so these volumes will now be included in year-over-year comparisons going forward.
Acquisitions, primarily U.S. packaged gas distributors, contributed 1% growth. Higher cost pass-through, largely higher natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers, increased sales by 1%. Sequentially, organic sales increased 2%, with the strongest end market sales growth to metals and food and beverage customers.
U.S. merchant volumes grew 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, with broad-based product growth strongest in metals, energy, manufacturing and food and beverage end markets. We've been able to take advantage of strong liquid argon demand due to operational excellence, diversity and supply sources and recent production capacity increases identified through productivity initiatives.
Food and beverage-related growth is driven both by new application technology and our new CO2 acquisition from early last year. Canadian merchant volumes grew year-over-year and sequentially, with strength in liquid nitrogen for fracking.
This quarter, we continue to see significant softness in our Mexico merchant oil well services business as our key customer, PEMEX, has continued limited production at certain fields due to budget constraints. Volumes to oil well service customers are below last year by double-digit percentage. Excluding negative oil well service volumes, organic sales to other end markets in Mexico, which is manufacturing and health care, have continued to grow.
U.S. packaged gas organic sales grew by 5% year-over-year, with gas and rent [ph] up 6%, and hard goods up 3%. In addition, acquisitions contributed 3% growth year-over-year. Organic growth was more heavily weighted to volume and price. The organic U.S. packaged gas growth was broad-based and strongest to customers in transportation, metal fabrication and machinery. Sales to energy, chemicals, health services and education such as welding schools also continue to grow.
North American operating profit was $416 million, 2% above the prior year quarter, and up 3%, excluding negative currency translation impact. The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing. The price environment remains positive and we are gaining traction on our recent price announcements. The year-over-year margin declined 20 basis points, in part due to headwinds from higher natural gas cost pass-through as well as the prior year quarter contract termination settlement. Segment operating margin was strong at 25.4%.
During the third quarter, we expanded our production network in Canada, with the start-up of a new 325-ton per day air separation plant that will supply gaseous oxygen and nitrogen to Vale, at its new nickel processing facility. Vale is utilizing a new hydrometallurgical process that uses oxygen to remove sulfur and iron from the nickel. This method makes it possible to process the nickel or concentrate directly into finished metal without having to smelt it first, avoiding sulfur dioxide and dust emission. Praxair's new plant will also serve merchant and packaged gas customers in a variety of sectors, including healthcare, offshore energy, metal fabrication and food and beverage.
Proposal activity for new on-site plants in North America remains solid in the chemicals and energy market relocated primarily in the U.S. Gulf Coast region as well as smaller on-site plants for manufacturing.
Now please turn to Page 5 for our results in Europe. Our European segment sales regenerated about 50% from Spain and Italy combined and the other half in Scandinavia, Germany, Benelux and most recently, Russia, which is still quite small. Sales in Europe were steady with the prior year quarter and grew 2%, excluding negative impacts of currency and cost pass-through. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year quarter due to price attainment and modest volume growth in most countries. Sales growth was driven by metals, food and beverage, healthcare and manufacturing end markets.
Sequentially, volumes were lower due to the obvious holiday season.
Operating costs of $71 million was up 11% for the third quarter, demonstrating strong operating leverage on modest growth and higher pricing and reflecting net density and efficiency benefits from the divestiture of our industrial gas business in France to Messer and acquisition of Messer's assets in Italy. New project bidding is active in Russia and Northern Europe, with most opportunities related to smaller on-site plants for manufacturing customers.
Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $523 million. Organic sales, excluding currency translation, grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Strong price of 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially included recovery of high inflation, largely in Venezuela and Argentina. South America volume growth of 3% year-over-year was about 2/3 from Brazil and 1/3 from the countries outside of Brazil. Praxair Brazil outperformed the estimated negative 4% industrial production in the quarter, driven by growth in health care and food and beverage end markets and application technologies. These were partially offset by weaker demand from metals customers. Merchant and packaged gas sales grew year-over-year and sequentially, while on-site sales were down year-over-year and steady sequentially.
Operating profit in South America increased 5%, excluding currency effects, as higher pricing and volumes were partially offset by cost inflation. The operating margin was strong at 22.6%, even with the challenging economic environment.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, our expectations for Brazil include currency translation headwinds year-over-year and sequentially, given the approximate 10% devaluation of the reais since mid-July. We're expecting sequential volume declines in conjunction with extended holiday production curtailment by customers, primarily in the metals and manufacturing end markets. This is consistent with prior years.
And with the elections now behind us in Brazil, we are not expecting any fourth quarter volume impact. However, we look forward to 2015 as the president identifies the new Finance Minister and begins to layout and implement her prospective agenda. Regardless, the business has and will continue to take action as needed to adjust to changing economic conditions, including cost reductions and continued discipline and execution of price and productivity programs.
Please turn to Slide 7 for our results in Asia. Sales of $426 million grew 11% from the prior year quarter. Volume growth of 10% year-over-year was driven by new project start-ups in India and Korea, and included a sale of equipment to our joint venture in China, serving a large chemical complex.
Price contributed to a 1% increase in sales and was primarily driven by helium. China had only modest base volume growth during the quarter, attributable to slowing macro conditions and our ongoing efforts to shift merchant sales from distributor channel to direct-served customers. Application technologies are driving growth to end users in the areas of combustion, metal fabrication and water.
India represents about 20% of the Asia segment sales for Praxair. Volumes grew 15% year-over-year, including project start-ups and 6% sequentially. Organic growth was strongest in metals and manufacturing end markets.
Asia's operating profit of $75 million increased 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher volume and pricing. On-site project bidding activity in Asia includes energy, metals, electronics and chemical companies, as well as smaller on-site plants for environmental benefits such as wastewater treatment and the manufacturing end market.
Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on Page 8. Surface Technologies sales for the quarter were $171 million, with organic sales growth of 3%, due primarily to higher pricing and coatings volume growth to energy and aerospace customers. Operating profit of $31 million increased 11% on higher volume, pricing and productivity improvement.
And now, I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our updated earnings guidance.
Matthew J. White
Please turn to Slide 9. Our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter is for EPS in the range of $1.53 to $1.60, which is about $0.10 lower than the implied guidance when using our prior full year projection. Approximately half of the impact is due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the other half is due to a lack of recovery in key emerging markets, most specifically Mexico energy and Brazil.
The month of September saw significant selloff in global currencies, especially those related to commodity-linked countries. We included in the Appendix a summary of foreign currency movements since we provided our prior guidance back in July. You can see our major currencies devalued anywhere from 5% to 10%. This is a significant move, especially for such a short time period. Like many others, we simply haven't seen improvement in key emerging markets. Budgetary constraints with PEMEX continue to hinder onshore well stimulation, which negatively impacts our Mexican energy business. This is down about 30% year-over-year.
And last July, we anticipated that Brazil would recover from the production curtailment after the World Cup and get back to about 0% industrial production. But instead, we have seen negative 4% to negative 5% figures every month. We also included a chart in the Appendix, where you can see that the majority of 2014 has been a technical recession for Brazil. Therefore, our current assumptions are that these trends will not reverse, but rather continue into the fourth quarter.
On the bright side, the U.S. continues to grow at mid-single digits and we are able to achieve positive price increases across the globe, in addition to our ongoing cost actions and productivity initiatives.
Using this updated fourth quarter outlook results in current 2014 full year EPS guidance to be in the range of $6.23 to $6.30, which represents 5% to 6% growth. Excluding negative currency translation, our full year EPS growth rate is projected to be 8% to 9% above 2013.
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some key year-to-date accomplishments. We have successfully started up 9 projects from our backlog and integrated several acquisitions around the world. Operating profit margin has expanded 30 basis points to maintain a healthy industry-leading 22.4%. Operating cash flow of $2.1 billion is a robust 23% of sales and funded $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $1.1 billion in shareholder returns split between dividends and stock repurchases. The key takeaway is that we know how to operate in challenging conditions and we will continue to improve our performance.
And I'd now like to turn the call over to Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Harrison from First Analysis.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division
I know it's pretty early since we've had the elections in Brazil, but are you getting any sense that we're starting to get back to business as usual between now and the holidays? And I guess, maybe if you could just give a little more color on your expectations around the holidays. It sounds like you expect that, that typical seasonal weakness, probably not a whole lot worse than in past years, but I know that in the past, we've seen that -- those holiday shutdowns last all the way into Carnival. What are your thoughts there?
Matthew J. White
Yes. So Mike, I think, first of all, you are correct. Our current assumption right now is kind of a continuation of the current trends and then sort of a normal both summer holiday and sort of Christmas break shutdown here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, this is coming off of a lower base than what we've seen in prior years. And as far as the election, clearly, too early, I think, to guess what impact it will have and we really don't anticipate any impact, up or down, here in the fourth quarter. I think, there have been some encouraging signs from President Rousseff as far as trying to work with the other party, trying to have some more pro-business initiatives. I think, Kelcey had mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's 2, I think, very good candidates for Finance Minister. Names are being floated around. I think, that could be beneficial. So we are hoping to see some traction here. And as you know, in the election, it was a very split election between sort of roughly the North and the South in terms of outlook. So I think, if what we're hearing so far kind of carries through, then we hopefully should be able to see some more business reforms, probably some of the social program reforms. Although we will -- we do anticipate we'll see some higher inflation here, at least in the near term, as they work through these. Remains to be seen. And it will be more of a 2015 impact, I think, at this point. But for 2014 and the back of this quarter here, pretty much kind of a continuation of what we have with a normal seasonal impact.
Michael J. Harrison - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division
Okay. And then, you noted the sales and operating profit excluding FX for the quarter up 5% and 6%, respectively. That's maybe a little bit less leverage than we've come to expect than you've shown in the past few quarters. What are some of the obstacles that you saw in the quarter to better operating leverage? And as we look into 2015, do you expect that to improve assuming we can still grow volumes at a kind of a low to mid-single-digit rate?
Matthew J. White
So clearly, we are still very focused on generating positive operating leverage. Part of the headwinds that we've had, clearly, the emerging market slowed down, that loss of volume comes at a fairly heavy margin, so by not having that incremental volume, that's a bit of a headwind on the -- on your operating leverage. We've had some start-ups in HYCO here that will be lapped here in the third quarter. But as you know, HYCO is a very pass-through-intensive type of energy, so while it's not much of an operating profit dollar impact on the pass-through, it will dilute your margins a bit. That will be lapped here in the fourth quarter. This was the last quarter of the Valero start-ups. Natural gas is higher year-over-year, so even North America specifically, that's about a 20 to 30 basis point headwind on our operating margins. And some of the unfavorable mix, I mean the Mexican energy headwinds that we're seeing, that tends to be a little bit higher-margin business. That's causing some challenges there as well. So we still are in the mist [ph] like we always are in cost actions and managing our costs around the market outlook. So we still expect to achieve positive operating leverage going forward. And I think, in this quarter, we just -- it wasn't as strong as we'd liked.

Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Matt, I was wondering, in your Appendix, you talked about the individual end markets around the chemical side, you mentioned the North American growth offset by Europe in customer maintenance. Can you give us a sense of what the customer concentration is in that end market in Europe? I would have thought maybe you could still see some growth there, but is there just 1 or 2 customers that are a big chunk of the business in that industry?
Matthew J. White
Yes. As you know, Bob, we don't have a very large presence in Europe. So some of our on-site chemical customers tend to be larger enclaves. So a few of them could move that particular end market for Europe a little more than some of the other regions where we are larger. And as far as the U.S. here, we've seen some good growth there. Coming into the fourth quarter that we are expecting a bit more turnaround than normal, especially in the energy space in the Gulf area. So -- but I wouldn't look into that anymore in Europe than it's just a couple concentrated pet chem enclaves where we're seeing a little bit of that.
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And can you talk about what you see on the CapEx profile looking forward? I know you'd guided up to $2.2 billion, and then it came back a little $2 billion, I see what you guided for this year in your Appendix. What do you think in '15 and beyond, how does that CapEx number look?
Matthew J. White
For capital expenditures?
Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, sir.
Matthew J. White
I think, right now, our latest number is around $1.7 billion, $1.8-ish billion, in that range. And it just really depends on the timing of some of the projects. I don't anticipate much of a difference from where we are now, kind of the run rate into the fourth quarter. We'll give more clear guidance in January, on 2015, but if we continue to see kind of some of the delays in signings, the number could be a bit lower. However, if we do start to sign some of these Gulf projects, it could spike up, especially with some of the pre-ordering of equipment. So remains to be seen. Right now, though, based on conditions that we're looking at, I'd expect it to be roughly consistent, plus or minus a few hundred million.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Regarding Asia, you referenced sale of equipment to a joint venture in China. Would you comment on the trend of underlying volume growth in Asia and/or China, excluding the equipment sales?
Matthew J. White
Sure. The equipment sale is probably about 2/3 of that. And like you said, that was to one of our JVs. Some of the offsetting benefit to that would be in equity income as they start to ramp up their volumes. But underlying trends right now, I think, what we're seeing is our on-site customers continue to run fairly well. On the merchant front, it still is challenging given the supply/demand situation. There's just, frankly, excess supply in several regions, due to some of the customer-owned liquefaction capacity. And as Kelcey had mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to pursue a channel strategy to shift more of our liquid direct and away from the distributor market. So that may hinder or be a bit of a headwind on our top line growth, but we still firmly believe it's going to help expand our margins and help improve our returns overall. As far as the on-site opportunities in China, kind of going forward, some of the big coal gasification projects, as you know, we've been quite selective on those. And I think, that was a good move on our part as several have been delayed some significantly. Permitting is still very challenging in China, given some of the environmental and corruption crackdown initiatives. So our view at this point is we probably see more smaller type assets that we would install small standard plants like our VPSA's end plant and more of an integrated density play. So that's kind of where we see it going, probably not growing at the same clip, maybe low-single digit to mid-single digit, but we're looking to improve profitability and our returns there.
Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
That's quite helpful. As a follow-up, shifting gears to Mexico. How large are your energy-related sales in Mexico as a base would you say? And then, on the trajectory, it sounded like, last quarter, you were hopeful that maybe you'd start to see some improvement. Now it appears that's not the case, at least for 4Q. How are you thinking about deeper into '15 and whether or not we'll eventually see some rebound there?
Matthew J. White
As far as percentage of our sales, it's roughly 1/4 to 1/3 when you add all forms of energy sales. So direct to PEMEX, as well as indirect to, say, service companies, so that's kind of a rough size of that component of the business. Looking at our thoughts back in July sort of versus now, if you may recall, in July, it was still kind of early in the reform and there was not clarity around the secondary laws. And at the time, our thought process was once there was clarity around the secondary laws, you would see some recovery of the activity levels in onshore. And what the least we've seen now is while there has been some clarity, budgetary constraints is still weighed heavily on this and it's kind of continued to be less activity and we're kind of at a bottom right now, I would say, in terms of the activity levels we're seeing. So our view is we just don't see it ticking up here in the fourth quarter. But you look at a company like PEMEX, it is a substantial portion of the tax revenue for a country like Mexico. It is a very, very important part of the economy there. So we don't believe this to be a long-term trend. We think it is more of a sort of short-term cyclical item. So we still think, in '15, it will be better. We're in the midst of developing our kind of '15 outlook on this and we'll give more clarity in January. But right now, we do expect recovery in '15, although, clearly, we'll have some tougher comps to lap in Q1 and Q2 of '14 when we were running at sort of normal levels.

Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Do you plan to change your absolute level of debt? Do you want to reduce your net debt or do you want to keep it at the same level? What do you plan to do with your capital structure?
Matthew J. White
So from a net debt perspective, right now, we're kind of keeping it around that $9 billion, plus or minus a few hundred million. We have been looking to term out commercial paper shorter-term debt where it makes sense. But right now, that general area is sort of an area where we're fairly comfortable in. We're not looking to expand it rapidly, but at the same token, I'm not looking to really decrease it either.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I guess, I should have been more precise. You generate a reasonable amount of free cash flow and the question is what you're going to do with it? You've got a share repurchase authorization, you can make acquisitions. Do you plan to allocate any of this for debt pay down?
Matthew J. White
No. I mean, again, if we're going to hold our net debt levels at this point, the view is there won't be significant allocation on a net-debt basis if that number essentially holds.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then, lastly, can you talk about what's happened to on-site volumes in the United States in the quarter? And what your outlook is for them?
Matthew J. White
So on-site volumes in third quarter, I think, it was a bit mixed. We saw some fairly good volumes in the Gulf. We had some challenges in steel and that was primarily due to some customer outages, some unplanned customer outages. But our expectation is that in fourth quarter, that the steel will recover and we've been seeing that. But as I mentioned earlier, we do see some fairly large hydrogen customer outages in the Gulf, primarily refiners that are taking some opportunistic turnarounds. So I think, steel, we'll see some recovery since these customer assets are back running and they want to run. And on the refining side, I think, it's just some turnarounds and some outages that will reduce those volumes a bit there in the fourth quarter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division
I have 2 questions that kind of relate to the Investor Day about 13 months ago. At that time, you established a 2017 sales goal of about $17 billion. And of course, there have been some speed bumps since then that you talked about already this morning. So based upon 2014, you'd need a CAGR of 9% to get to that goal, is it time now to kind of back off that $17 billion sales goal in 2017?
Matthew J. White
Yes, Mark, the way I kind of look at it is we have been, over the last year, sort of guiding toward the high-single-digit sales target. And granted, 9% to get to that $17 billion is on the top end of that. But when I break down the components of that high-single-digit number and look at the pieces, of which, it's organic growth project contribution, acquisitions and price. I think, from an acquisitions and price standpoint, we're pretty much hitting where we expected. And at this point, we haven't seen any reason to think differently on that front. I think, the base volume piece has been more challenging and clearly the emerging markets. As you may recall, we had sort of to build that high-single-digit number look to be sort of 2% to 3% on base volume growth and we're operating lower than that and it's a combination of some South American macro challenges, this cyclical Mexican energy situation and you are seeing some decelerations in China. So I think, that has made that piece of the pie a little more difficult. And on the project piece, I think, the delays are stretching it out a bit. So we do expect to sign projects and get our backlog back up, but probably will push out the contribution a bit. So we'll give more clarity in January, on '15. But when we look out a few years, we still think that high single digit, now that would be more 7%, 8%, 9% kind of number, it's feasible, but we're going to have these challenges in the macro front and potentially timing of project contribution.
Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division
That's helpful. Now also, at the Investor Day, you indicated the share count reduction goal of 1% to 2% per year. Quite frankly, you've been running at the very low end of that for some time. I think, maybe going back to 2012. So there have been some questions on capital allocation already. How are you thinking about's share repurchases going forward to stand at that 1%? Or perhaps moving up towards the 2%?
Matthew J. White
Yes. So right now, our view is to clearly still stay in the range, 1% to 2%, and we are in that range currently. And it's kind of an overall, as you can imagine, capital allocation structure. So if we do see our CapEx declining a bit, that number will continue to go up. But we do look to keep raising our dividend every year in line with earnings, which is another component of the use of cash. And to the question earlier, we're looking to roughly maintain our net cash debt position. We're not looking to lever that up too much. I mean, it may go up a bit, it may go down a little bit, and it will bounce around, but we're going to stay in that kind of general range. So if there -- if you envision a scenario with a lower CapEx, this number will climb a lot. If CapEx were to stay roughly flat and our operating cash flow grows at this rate, this number will climb a bit. So it just remains to be seen how those numbers work out, but our intention is absolutely continue in this range.

Our next question comes from James Sheehan from SunTrust.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Just on the Lin/Lox operating rates, could you give us a sense for what those were like in your outlook going forward given the macro situation?
Matthew J. White
Yes. Sure. So kind of looking at some of the rates around the world. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, these are kind of different within each region, but we try to sort of give a generic average rate across. So even within each region, it could be quite different. But North America is low 80s and creeping up a little bit as we've seen kind of mid-single-digit merchant numbers in the U.S. So that's been driving some positive outlook there. Also, argon is quite tight in the U.S. today. So we've been essentially selling a significant amount of argon, which is also keeping the utilizations up a little bit. South America right now, mid-80s. And again, this is on the Lin/Lox LAR now. And we are seeing in South America, on-site is more sluggish. We probably have a handful of maybe 4 or 5 customers that are sort of below M top levels given some of the challenges in steel in Brazil right now, especially around flat for the auto and somewhat along related to construction. But the merchant still runs quite well and a lot of that is servicing healthcare, food, beverage, which, as you saw on our end markets, continue to do quite well being the noncyclical type of industries that they are. Europe is mid-70s right now, kind of spread across the North and South combined. We're seeing very high utilization still in Russia. Utilization is a little bit lower in the South and a little bit better in the North. And Asia is kind of a mix, depending upon the country. But when you add it all together, probably high 70s right now, and part of this is part of, I mentioned earlier, our channel strategy on merchant liquid by pursuing more of a quality approach. We are just selling less liquid, so our utilizations there will drop a little. But clearly, we have ample capacity around the world. And when these markets do recover, we're very well-positioned to be able to supply the liquid end of the market for it.
James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Terrific. And also, you talked a little bit about your return on capital. What do you see as the trend going forward over the next 12 months or so, given the current macro headwinds you're seeing?
Matthew J. White
Yes. I think, our expectation is still that will improve. Clearly, it's got 2 parts to the equation, the NOPAT in the numerator and then the capital base in the denominator. And we expect to continue to grow NOPAT. So in fact, if you look at our sort of, some people call it instantaneous calculation this quarter, that was a nice improvement, it just wasn't enough to weigh enough into the average calculation. But we do expect to climb that up. But it's a slow climb, as you imagine, it's a 5-quarter trailing capital base that you have to overcome. So we do expect to continue to bring it up and that's a very important metric for our presidents around the world that they are compensated on So we're going to continue to work to improve that.

Next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.
George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
This is actually George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Given oil price declines, have you seen any projects there in your backlog, maybe thinking about when they would start producing their CapEx? Is there a peg for at what oil price you would really start to see some changes there?
Matthew J. White
So I think, lower oil price actually had impact us a couple of different ways, in addition to probably just the backlog. I'll kind of try and briefly touch on some of them. Clearly, currency, any commodity-linked countries sort of getting the currency headwind and that for the most part is reflected in our outlook in numbers, as you've seen the real, the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, sort of selloff. But looking at sort of other impacts, I think, there's 3 kind of potential impacts for us, the sort of our current customer base, our potential future customer base related to backlogs and projects, and then just sort of the aggregate demand across our portfolio. So when you first start with the sort of aggregate demand across the portfolio, lower energy costs should bode well for a good portion of our customer base, in manufacturing, transportation. And consistent with what we've seen with our sort of diverse portfolio, we tend to see both positives and negatives with moves in commodities like this, up or down. So I think, we'll probably see some positive pickup on that side. Now when you look at the direct impact to energy customers, our current energy sales are about 13% to that end market, which is roughly $1.5 billion in the top line. So about 2/3 of that is downstream. So that's primarily hydrogen and a little bit of oxygen and nitrogen mostly into the refining space. So we don't really anticipate much of a negative impact in the refining space. I mean, some could argue that they might benefit here on spreads given lower feedstock costs. But at this point, we're not anticipating much of a change in the refining behavior. So the remaining third is mostly upstream with a little bit of midstream. And the upstream is kind of spread all over. It's primarily Canada, U.S., Mexico. It's a combination of our offshore business with Dominion, our packaged business to the well site, and it's also CO2 and nitrogen that we're putting downhaul for either EOR or fracturing. So that one clearly will have some impact, but it's hard to gauge because our customers are -- have different products. Some are going oil, some are going NGLs, some are hedged as far out as 18-plus months. And they all have different well cost to produce. So on a high level, what I'd anticipate is, at this point, we think, we'd probably start to see some impact in the 70s. So think $70 to $80. We'll see some of the higher costs drilling areas, probably Northern Canada, start to tone it down a bit. Then if we get into the 60s, we might see another tranche of spot producers that have higher costs. And then, if we get down into the 50s, we'd probably see a more significant impact as well. So I think, the impact would be gradual. It would step down and it would impact everyone differently. I think, Mexico right now, we're sort of at a floor already. And that's been more government budgetary-driven than commodity price-driven. So really, it's more U.S. and Canada at this point, I think, that are -- that will be impacted. And then, as far as to your specific question on project, current backlog projects are mostly all downstream in the refining space. And then, future opportunities, we're looking at the vast majority of either refining or petchem. And those are more long-range kind of secular plays and that we're really basing it on the low-cost feedstock. So clearly, their end plastics products may go up or down on oil. But they're really, I think, chasing a low-cost feedstock and that's what's attractive to them. So it remains to be seen, but at this point, we're not hearing anything on those projects to the contrary.
George D'Angelo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Okay. That's very helpful. And can you guys just provide a little bit of granularity in manufacturing to your largest end market and just kind of what was accelerating, what was decelerating within that end market?
Matthew J. White
Sure. U.S. has been good. We've seen manufacturing across the board do well, especially areas like manufacturing for transportation, so automotive, railcars. And that's been fairly broad-based. South America, it's been okay, some of the manufacturing. But again, they're seeing some pretty big macro headwinds. And I'd say, in other parts of the region, it's been kind of low-single-digit improvement. But really, U.S. has been leading that effort. We're probably seeing some of the best results in the U.S. on manufacturing improvements.

Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Matt, can you remind us on the new plant impact for 2014 and 2015 on EPS basis in terms of new plant start-ups?
Matthew J. White
Yes. So for 2014, as you know, we've always kind of been giving a range of $0.20 to $0.30. In 2014, we're around the bottom end of that, pretty close to the bottom end of that number. Looking out to '15, expectation is we'd still be in that bottom part of the number as well, given that things are just a little slower to execute and some projects may carry a little bit into next year, and some of the other projects that we'd hope to sign earlier this year that might have smaller turnarounds just drag a little bit. So I think, in both cases, lower end of that number is kind of where we're ending up.
David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
And you mentioned some positive comments on pricing. Would you say the overall pricing environment in industrial gases has improved? And any impact from the new management team at your products in terms of an overall better pricing environment?
Matthew J. White
There's nothing that I could comment on. I've seen from a specific competitor that's maybe overall pricing environment better. But what I can say from at least our view of what we've seen is, clearly, areas with higher inflation, we're getting better pricing. For example, South America. So as inflation gets higher, we should be able to continue to get better pricing. We've made a few announcements here in the U.S. Apparently, our competitors have made some announcements as well. I think, that's based on some of the tightness of supply and also especially around argon is quite tight. So I think, definitely, we're seeing where product is tighter, pricing is better, and where there's higher inflation, pricing is better. And you take an area like China, it's still challenging, pricing. And hence, why we're sort of changing our channel strategy.

Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Matt, in terms -- when you take a look at the last 3 years, EPS growth is lower than your typical double digits you've done historically. I understand a lot of this is the external environment. But are you seeing anything on a secular basis that maybe is slowing the demand for industrial gases? Or you feel pretty comfortable that as the economy picks up, you can maybe get back on that track?
Matthew J. White
Yes. I think, Mike, you look back a couple of years, first, we've had FX headwinds almost every year. So I think, you probably want to look at that, excluding FX. And as you know, that's primarily translational impact. So excluding that, we've been pretty close to the double digit. Clearly, we've seen some challenging macro conditions as well, think Southern Europe. Obviously, Brazil is kind of going in and out of recessions and sort of back in. So the macro conditions have been slower. The FX headwinds have been greater. And I think, that's really what's been driving it. We haven't seen any change in view or change in technology or just less consumption. I think, what you're just -- from a technological standpoint, what you rather just seen is people aren't running as hard. There's just not as much industrial activity or consumption from some of these, especially emerging markets. I mean, we've seen some very good improvements in some of our markets like the U.S. It's just been the emerging markets have been a challenge.
Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Great. And then, in terms of the backlog, at what level do you need to keep it at to be able to produce sort of this $0.20 to $0.30 on an annual basis? And when you think about some of the stuff that you're bidding on, is there enough bidding activity in the areas where you can hit your hurdle rates or return profiles to continue to keep that backlog where you want it to be?
Matthew J. White
Yes. I would say we'd probably need a backlog of at least about $2 billion consistently without many delays and how projects start or rollout. So that would be important for that to happen to help contribute to those numbers. And when I kind of look at the type of projects that we are in the midst of bidding, they are larger. They are probably longer in duration, not just design, but some of them potentially to build. So I just think, going forward, it will probably be a little lumpier, just given the size of some of these petchem enclaves.

Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just wondering, if you held FX constant where it's at today, roughly how big of a headwind would that be for next year?
Matthew J. White
Yes. Well, Duffy, you could probably do the math based on our filings for what percentage of sales we have in each. But put it this way, when we went from our Q4 guidance to our new guidance and we've called it down $0.10, half of it was FX-related. So you could probably work that math through. But right now, you've got the reais, it's close to BRL 2.50, right. The Canadian dollars bouncing around CAD 1.12. The euro continues to devalue. So it's definitely created some headwinds. But as you know, it's impossible to predict where it will be. We just sort of laid out a view of kind of where the rates have been over the last couple of weeks and that's sort of what we baked in. So I think, if you sort of take those movements in those numbers, you could probably build that into a model.
Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Okay. And then, second one, a lot of stuff has changed in the last year. The Russia political stuff. Mexico, weaker. Brazil, weaker. China, weaker. Have your hurdle rates changed in any of these countries as your bidding business versus a year ago?
Matthew J. White
No. As you probably know, the way we've developed our hurdle rates have a component for sovereign risk and currency devaluation risk. So we've always embedded that into our IRR model. So for example, if the U.S. return would be 14%, we might expect a 19% or 20% in a different foreign country because of the devaluation risk. And then, when you look at that on a U.S. basis, it equates back to that U.S. 14%. So what we would do is we would just tweak those devaluation sort of sovereign risk ratings, but that's all that we've really done. And now, when you look at Russia specifically, we're definitely going to be more cautious given the situation there. But frankly, the preventative measures we've taken are playing out. They have been protecting us and they're working. So I think, we anticipated that fairly well. But we're going to continue to be as cautious as we have been, I think. And specific situations like Russia, we're going to add another layer of analysis just to make sure that we're comfortable.
I think, we have time for one more question.

Our last question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
I had a question, just to clarify. So earlier this year, you started out the year with $6.25 to $6.55 guidance. You're cutting $0.25 at the top end. What would you see -- what portion of that is FX versus what portion of that would just be weaker volumes and hence, lower operating leverage potential?
Matthew J. White
Yes. I think, FX is probably close to 3%. And I guess, if you go back to Duffy's question, looking forward, it could be more than that next year, we can just say it that way. But the other challenge that we -- FX year-over-year, by the way, Don, at 3%. I think, the biggest challenge we've had this year on where we started in January to where we are now is really this Lat Am piece. We did not have this PEMEX impact reflected with these volume slowdown. And frankly, we didn't see it until partway through toward the end of Q2. And frankly, we looked at Brazil, you may recall, we said it would be uneven, we said it would be up, we said it would be down. And that was how it started the year. And then, we went to the World Cup, we never quite recovered. And my personal opinion is everything just kind of went on a freeze going into the election. There was a lot of uncertainty, there was a lot of investments being held back. And frankly, I think, there was a lot of overaction in terms of some doom and gloom. Now that, that is behind us, now that there's certainty, I'm hoping that at least bring back some confidence in decision-making. Because that, I think, had a bigger impact on investment over the last 4 to 5 months than it probably should have. And they still have a lot of infrastructure needs. I mean, people forget they still have the Olympics in about 1.5 years, and there's still some significant amount of transportation infrastructure and some of the country infrastructure that they need to spend money on. So that's the big driver, I think, between where we started the year and where we're ended up right now.
Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division
Okay. And just one follow-up. On packaged gas, you talked about being up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. What's the split there between hard goods and gas and rent? And last quarter, you had a pickup in hard goods, which I would have thought would have given you some more growth in gas and rent this quarter, especially with what appears to be some better nonresidential construction data.
Matthew J. White
So on the 5% sort of improvement, about 6% gas, rent and other and 3% is hard goods. And really, what we're seeing on the hard goods side is the majority of this is automation equipment. And I think, what we're seeing more in our customer base is it's not as much adding automation equipment to increase capacity, which would obviously result in incremental gas pull through. I think, it's more putting automation equipment because of either high cost of labor or lack of availability of labor. So think automatic cutters, automatic welders, robotics. So that's a big driver of some of our hard goods and really making our customers more efficient. So that part is not having that big of a pull through, but we still have a very healthy gas number at 6%. As Kelcey have mentioned, we're seeing virtually all markets improving now, even the heavy industry, we're starting to see a little bit of uptick. The only, I'd say, market right now that is still negative for us is the government side. We're just not seeing a lot of activity there. But education, welding schools, universities, spec gases across the whole industrial sector has been quite good and transportation has been very strong. So that's kind of what we've been seeing on that front. But that business continues to perform well.
