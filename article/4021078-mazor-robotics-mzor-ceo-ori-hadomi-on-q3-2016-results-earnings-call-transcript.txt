Ori Hadomi
Good morning, thank you Michael and welcome to Mazorâs third quarter 2016 conference call to discuss our operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the results and then I will review the substantial developments that have occurred just since our second quarter conference call. These events along with our growth strategies and commitment to innovation contribute to our position as the market leader in guidance systems for spine surgery. As we previously announced on October 10, we received purchase orders for 25 systems during the third quarter. This represents a new record for the number of orders received in any single quarter and nearly matches the number of orders we received in all of 2015. It's fair to say that our effort and strategy are bearing fruit. The 25 system purchase orders during the quarter included three Mazor X pre-launch orders that we expect to deliver to the US customers by the end of the first quarter of 2017, four Renaissance Systems ordered by US customers that were delivered during the third quarter of 2016, three Renaissance Systems ordered by distribution partners in the international markets, and 15 Mazor X systems ordered by our strategic partner Medtronic, four of which we delivered during Q3 2016 to Medtronic for training centers.
Regarding our current installed base, we ended the third quarter with 131 Renaissance Systems globally, of which 79 are in the US market. This compares with 96 globally and 56 systems in the US at the end of 2015 third quarter. We reported revenue of $7.6 million in the third quarter, a 52% increase compared to $5 million in the year-ago third quarter. As we previously reported, following the July unveiling of the Mazor X, we implemented a policy enabling US customers who recently purchased a Renaissance System, a limited time option to exchange to a Mazor X system after the commercial launch. Therefore, revenue from system sales with exchange option will be deferred until the earlier of delivery of the Mazor X systems following option exercised by the customer or expiry of the exchange option. Sharon will provide more detail about how this policy impacted our Q3 revenues later.
Recurring revenue which increased 30% over the year ago third quarter to 4.3 million continued to demonstrate the strong clinical and economical value proposition of our technology and further reliance on Mazorâs product. The three pre-launch orders we received during the third quarter were from hospitals located in California, Kentucky, and Idaho, and we expect to deliver these by the end of 2017 first quarter. Additionally, we delivered four Mazor X systems to Medtronic training facilities. Three of the four Renaissance Systems ordered by US customers were installed at hospitals in South Carolina, Idaho, and Virginia. The fourth system was installed at an ambulatory service center or ASC in New Jersey; this is the first installation of a Renaissance System in ASC in the northeast, and represents a concerted effort of our part to target ASCs. We believe the trend to drive certain procedures to the ASC to lower cost while relying on MIS to avoid utilization represent right opportunity for the renaissance system, given the new price point. 
Internationally, we received purchase order for three renaissance systems, one each in Germany, Australia, and Thailand. Australia, which is becoming a robust market for Renaissance now has five systems and there are a total of 21 Renaissance systems throughout Asia Pacific. The sales of our distribution partner in Thailand which purchased its first system demonstrates our ability to penetrate new markets. The remaining 15 systems in Q3 were ordered by our strategic partner, Medtronic.
This brings me to the next part of our discussion and to the Medtronic agreement that together with the launch of the Mazor X is greatly influencing our growth prospects, an evidence of this is already materializing. The agreement we signed in May with Medtronic is raising our profile among articles, significantly expanding our geographic footprint, and deepening the marketing -- the market access that we can achieve. Our own capital team complemented by Medtronic with its sales force of 100s of trained and experienced reps, create a powerful and distributed sales structure with the potential to reach and serve many patients. With our recent strategic accomplishment, we have succeeded in generating a lot of enthusiasm within the markets.
To leverage this enthusiasm in the marketplace, we have commenced co-promotion and co-marketing efforts. To date, we have trained over 100 Medtronic sales managers on the Mazor X and they are sharing their knowledge with 100s of sales reps Medtronic is dedicating to this effort. These co-promotion activities were designed so that by the time we launch Mazor X in October, the two companies could hit the ground running and translate the interest into a tangible result. 
As I mentioned, we launched Mazor X at the North American Spine Society annual meeting last month, and the amount of interest at our booth was remarkable. Over 250 surgeons visited the booth. Eight hands-on cadaver lab sessions during the three days were almost fully subscribed, sometimes with over 30 surgeons test driving our system in a single hour. Medtronicâs booth which was near Mazorâs booth also displayed the Mazor X and they too had a high volume of traffic. It was really encouraging to see such committed effort on their part, both at the convention center and leading up to the meeting.
During NASS, we announce an order for three Mazor X systems by a first time customer, a major regional institution in the Northeast. This was a lead that our sales team generated and had been pursuing for several months, and the relationship with Medtronic accelerated the buying decision. So as we're getting closer to the end of 2016 and entering 2017, I feel very confident about our growth prospects and our ability to meet our sales objective.
Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the third quarter, I want to review and provide an update on our growth strategies. We ended the third quarter with 16 capital sales reps and completed our planned recruiting, as weâre now with 20 capital sales reps. I believe that the Mazor and Medtronicâs synergistic sales structure and the process that we have established will serve the dual goal for broadening the sales funnel and accelerating the sales cycle.
 Mazor sales reps are focused on closing sales for Mazor X as well as selling the renaissance system. Medtronic sales reps are responsible for generating the awareness and interest for the Mazor X. So I believe that our team of 20 capital sales reps allows us to address both the renaissance and Mazor X opportunities.
Focusing on our clinical representation force, we ended the third quarter with 63 clinical representatives supporting the current installed base of renaissance systems. For the newly launched Mazor X, we made strategic decision to augment clinical representation through a one-to-one ratio of clinical rep to installation, so we will be increasing the number of our clinical reps during the remainder of this year and throughout 2017 to drive successful clinical penetration of the Mazor X system during its early stage of market use.
Thirdly, we remain focused on expanding the use of our technology for patient benefit throughout utilization of the systems. Utilization of the system supports sales effort and drives a significant revenue stream. Moreover, it is the most direct indication of customer defection and the main validation for clinical value proposition. The third quarter utilization in the US remain high despite summer months and our utilization objectives were reached. Fourth, is our priority to deliver product innovation and enhancement at regular intervals to maintain high level of custom satisfaction and to maintain our leadership position. Mazor has an elaborated product development pipeline part of which is being co-developed with our commercialization partner.
Finally, we continue to engage in clinical studies and data collection. I will mention only a couple of the five peer-reviewed studies that were published during the third quarter. In September, the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery published a study titled a prospective randomized controlled trial of robot-assisted versus freehand pedicle screw fixation in spine surgery. The data from this study showed that robotically assisted pedicle screw placement was associated with fewer proximal facet joint violations and better convergence orientations. This level one evidence data reinforce the clinical impact of Mazor Robotics technology on patient outcomes by significantly reducing complications and revision rates as was reported from other studies earlier this year. And second study titled CT radiation reduction in robotic assisted pediatrics spinal surgery provided data which showed the CT protocol optimization can produce acceptable image quality with doses comparable to the use of fluoroscopy will significantly reducing the traditionally high radiation doses produced by CT scanning and substantially decreasing exposure to the highly radio sensitive pediatric population.
We are very encouraged by the clinical-based evidence and considerable patient benefit that these studies show our technology brings to the market. Our performance in the third quarter and throughout 2016 is encouraging and demonstrate the marketâs continuing migration to our technology platform. This coupled with a level of enthusiasm being displaced by our strategic partner and a positive reception of the Mazor X helps us forge ahead as the leader in guidance spice surgery systems.
Now, to review the financial highlights of the third quarter I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you Ori, and hello everyone. I would review our financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.6 million, an increase of 52% compared to $5 million in the third quarter last year. Geographically, revenue in the US was $5.7 million or 75% of total revenue with $1.9 million or 25% of revenue from the international markets. Capital sales revenue was $3.3 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. As Ori mentioned earlier, we received orders for 25 systems but during the third quarter we recognized revenue from ten systems only. Three Renaissance Systems in the US and four internationally alone with Mazor X systems installed in electronic training centers which were sold at a discounted price. One international system and one US recognized this quarter are the result of Q2 orders. The international systems was ordered by our distributive partner in China during Q2 and delivered in Q3. During the last yearâs third quarter we recognized revenue from three sold systems in the US. We ended the third quarter of 2016 with three Renaissance Systems installed in the US and not recognized as revenue due to the exchange option to Mazor X available to the customers.
In addition, we have two Mazor X systems in backlog. Revenue from service and disposal kit sales and other grew to $4.3 million as 30% increase compared to $3.3 million in the last yearâs third quarter, reflecting the increase in utilization primarily in the US market as well as the increase in the size of our installed base. Gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 65.7% compared to 75.9% in the year ago third quarter. The lower gross margin is mainly due to three factors. The sale of three systems for demonstration to our strategic partner at the discounted price, lower pricing of the renaissance system due to the high mix of sales to distributors in the international market and a reduction of the renaissanceâs list price following the introduction of Mazor X system. 
Operating expenses were $10.6 million compared to $8.9 million in the year ago third quarter. The increase in expense is mainly due to our continued investment in sales and marketing as we recruited more sales and clinical reps and investing activity to raise our brand awareness and to broaden our sales footprint. We also continue to invest in R&D to support the Mazor X development and increase our product offering. The research and development expenses are net of $1.3 million in development costs, relating to the Mazor X network capitalized in this intangible asset during the third quarter.
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the third quarter of 2016 was 5.2 million or $0.11 per share compared to $5.2 million or $0.12 per share in the year ago third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was 4.9 million or $0.11 per share compared to 4.2 million or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2015.
During the quarter, cash used in operating activities was 4.6 million compared to 2.6 million in the last yearâs third quarter. As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately 64.3 million, which includes the 20 million from the second tranche equity investment by Medtronic, received during third quarter of 2016 in addition to 12 million received from Medtronic in the first tranche during the second quarter of 2016.
That concludes my remarks. And I will pass the call now back to Ori.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. Our sales momentum is already extending into the fourth quarter as we already received orders for six systems during the first five weeks of the quarter. These orders include the multi system order that we disclosed on October 26 for three Mazor X systems. This was from a new customer in the Northeast region and it highlighted the effectiveness of the co-marketing activities with Medtronic and the extended market reach enabled by the strategic operation.
Beyond these orders, we have received an additional three orders including two Mazor X systems as well as one renaissance system. Itâs fair to say that the team is encouraged and enthusiastic. We are less than halfway through the fourth quarter and I can say without question that 2016 has already been an incredible year for Mazor. Our two key accomplishments, the Medtronic agreement and the launch of the Mazor X will continue to propel us forward as weâre trying to form and redefine the standard of care for spine surgery. 
However, with less than 100 US hospitals using our systems, we have only penetrated less than 5% of the addressable market. The upside from here is incredible. We will end 2017 with two platforms and approaching 21,000 clinical cases, the number that is unmatched. And committed partner who shared our vision for the future of spine surgery. Also, our strengthened balance sheet gives us the resources to add incremental revenue opportunities for many years to come. Thank you again for joining the call. 
Operator, weâre now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Weâll go first to the line of Jeffrey from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning. So Iâm going to ask two questions. So you spoke about the current quarter with the six systems during the first five weeks, can you couple that a little bit with the 16 Medtronic orders, which was announced October 10, and can you give us a little bit of a flavor of what you expect to be delivered and installed and become operational during the fourth quarter versus spilling into 2017?
Ori Hadomi
Weâre doing all that we can, Jeff in order to be able to deliver to the customers that issued orders, this system during the fourth quarter. Weâre definitely gearing our manufacturing and doing all that we can in order to meet the demand. And I expect that all these customersâ purchase system will get the system during the fourth quarter. As to the Medtronic systems, we mentioned five systems to the training facilities being delivered, and we will prioritize the ten according to the demand to the customers, and thatâs in full collaboration and we're very much synchronized with Medtronic about it.
Jeffrey Cohen
And secondly, Sharon, could you elaborate a little bit for us as far as customers out there who may wish to upgrade or change platforms from Renaissance to the X? Can you give us an estimate of how we should think about that into the fourth quarter and 2017 as far as number of customers and what we [indiscernible]?
Sharon Levita
Right now as I mentioned we have three Renaissance systems that we installed, we did not recognize them and therefore they have an option -- the reason we did not recognize is because they have an option to upgrade to Mazor X. And that they have time limits on this option and those are three that would carryover maybe to next year and then we have additional two Mazor X systems ordered from previous quarters that we will aim to deliver. And other than that, we have customers who will interested but we haven't disclosed the numbers. And we havenât received additional orders.
Jeffrey Cohen
And will we begin to discuss Renaissance units which got upgraded to the X which have been placed in new locations going forward?
Sharon Levita
I think it would be part of exchange policy, we will announce that.
Operator
Thank you. We will go next to the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matt Taylor
So I guess I wanted to just talk a little bit about the indicators that you're seeing with Medtronic and the relationship there and help us understand how that's going. If you could talk a little bit about the training that you've been doing at NASS and the bookings of training going forward, leads, things like that, help us understand the marriage and what you're getting from them commercially?
Ori Hadomi
The bottom line is that we are very pleased with the way this agreement is translated to activity and to productivity in the field. We built a lot of different mechanisms between the R&D teams, between the marketing teams including the sales groups that each one of these groups work according to work plan and with a very well defined structure to assure optimized alignment between the team. Our training event that takes place every week, sometimes two days a week and sometimes one day every week are fully booked with leads until the end of the first quarter and actually I believe it's now well already into the second quarter. So, new leads will need to be pushed next to the second and third quarter unless we will add more training days during the time until there.
We have held - we have trained, I think thatâs about 160 Medtronic sales managers, training managers, and regional sales executive and they are the people that champion the Mazor X business for Medtronic in their regions, and they will train - they are training and sharing the knowledge with their teams in the field. I feel as of today, there is very robust, organized, and productive activity between the two organizations, you can see the results. I don't think that in the past we were in a position that at mid of the quarter we could report on purchase orders, you all know it, and I believe that the dynamic in the trends that we all experience these days and many of you could feel it also I believe [indiscernible] are in many ways result of this very fruitful collaboration and very -- the synergy between these two organizations that weâd put in place.
Matt Taylor
Thanks for that. And just I was wondering, there's certainly a lot of buzz around robotics or the big theme at NASS this year and you have some competitors in the US, and coming to the US maybe you can offer some thoughts around how you feel the renaissance and X platforms are really differentiated and stand out versus some of the other robotic solutions that are out there and coming?
Ori Hadomi
Absolutely. As we discussed also in previous calls, we expect that in the coming years, more players will come to the market. All of us could see doing that, both what Globus are developing and what Medtech together with Zimmer brings to the market. We are in the area of spine surgery, robotic spine surgery for the last almost 15 years. We accumulated close to 20,000, around 20,000 cases with the system and we learned what the surgeons really need.
We are coming to the market and we're introducing now to the market a product that explains the role of robotics far beyond just guidance. I believe that the synergy with Medtronic allows us to offer a complete solution with the Mazor X that will facilitate a faster, safer and more predictable spine surgery solution. When you compare it to others, I have all the trust in the world that all the other companies will come at the end of the day with good products. I believe it will take them time. I believe that they will need to accumulate a lot of experience and a lot of work until the product will be ready for commercialization and will meet the expectation of surgeon, but at the end of the day, I believe that other companies will come with good products. And as you can expect from an innovative company like Mazor, we are always working ahead on new innovations and we will keep our leadership as we demonstrated this year.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go next to the line of Craig Bijou with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Craig Bijou
Hi, guys. I want to start with just some of the orders, the Mazor X orders. I believe if you include the three preorders in Q3 and then the five in Q4, you have 8 Mazor X orders outside of Medtronic and I just wanted to, I just, I guess, I wanted to get a sense for how many of those orders were generated by Medtronic leads and as you -- with your expanding capital sales force and as you look forward to 2017, I mean is there any color in terms of what percentage of orders you foresee coming from Medtronic leads versus your own capital sales force?
Ori Hadomi
Yeah. So as to the future, the future will tell. Itâs hard for me to predict. I do expect that the time will -- the more the Medtronic team will be trained and exposed, the more leads will be generated together and the synergy will be demonstrated in the pipeline leads. Thatâs what we see already now. Out of the eight Mazor X orders that you counted, I think itâs four of them have been generated by, the lead has been generated by Medtronic and other four have been generated by Mazor independent activity.
Craig Bijou
Great. Thanks for that. And then if I could just switch to kind of the Japanese approval, I think on the last call, you said you were near the finish line. So just wanted to see if we can get an update there, and then upon approval, whenever that would happen, are there any additional steps necessary for you to start selling in Japan? I mean, do you have a distributor lined up? Do you have the infrastructure to sell immediately upon approval?
Ori Hadomi
First, there is lack of clarity right now. Weâre trying to approach the Japanese regulatory authorities and I must admit we didnât get any answer. So I really donât have any additional information to share and I don't have with me any new information that will tell me how close we are to get a clearance. To the best of our knowledge, all information has been submitted during the third quarter, but if I remember correctly and according to our regulatory team, it takes at least nine months between 9 to 18 months since submission until clearance. But really, honestly, I really don't know and because weâre trying to get, to get answers and we don't have answers.
As to sales infrastructure in Japan, yes, we do have an agreement with distributors in Japan that we believe that can do a good job for us, but everything will begin only upon getting the clearance.
Operator
And weâll go next to the line of Mike Matson with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Mike Matson
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start with a couple questions for Sharon. So what -- can you tell us what the share count is going to be, post the Medtronic investment, the diluted share count on the P&L in the press release reflect all those shares or is there -- are there more coming or I guess more in terms of that being an average, I guess maybe it doesn't reflect the full number?
Sharon Levita
Yeah. Right now, the number that was included in this quarter includes the full number of the shares and right now, I cannot tell you what would be the share count. This will be issued if they will exercise the third tranche, because I'm not sure what will be the price of the shares at that time.
Mike Matson
Yeah. I understand, but so 46.2 million roughly is the correct number as of the end of the third quarter?
Sharon Levita
Yes.
Mike Matson
Okay. All right. And then just, you commented on the doubling of the number of clinical reps. So how can we think about the impact of that on your operating spend, I mean, is that going to almost double your sales and marketing expense or is that not the right way to think about it?
Sharon Levita
It's not going to double, but there would be the sales expense -- the line that you see, sales and marketing expense accumulate altogether, so Iâm going to double that number, but definitely we will continue to see an increase with a higher proportion maybe then which we had this quarter, this year due to the increase in clinical number.
Mike Matson
All right. And then Ori, just on the systems, just curious what you think the capacity is for getting one system, how many procedures per year and I guess one way to maybe think about that is in terms of the hospital that youâve seen come back and by second and third units, how many procedures were they doing on that first system before they had to come back and buy another one?
Ori Hadomi
The only -- if I'm looking for any equivalent I would use to make any assumption or would you have the renaissance, that we have with renaissance. So if you look at our renaissance system, what we serve is that, we sold a second system to three sites and in all of these three sites, we used the system for more than 120 cases a year and there were at least three active surgeons that use the system and this kind of for us, the rule of thumb of an opportunity for more than one. 
So itâs really and Iâm showing this based on our history, but we may see different things with the Mazor X, because I think the Mazor X does offer different qualities and that may trigger them to buy more than one. Right now, our assumptions are based on one system per hospital and but we do see several institutions that are interested from the very beginning to buy more than one system and one deal we already announced, but we believe there will be more in the future.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Weâll go next to the line of Tracy Marshbanks with First Analysis. Please go ahead.
Tracy Marshbanks
Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. Sharon, could you help me just on the cash flows for a renaissance trade-in option and not the revenue recognition, but from a cash perspective, do I look at it as a Renaissance sale and then at some point in the future they have an option to trade it in and there will be an additional cash payment given the price differential, what - when do you collect the money I guess on a deal like that?
Sharon Levita
So, first of all there are different cases, sometimes [indiscernible] the entire cash and sometimes they do have an additional price difference to pay upon the exchange. We are not delivering system without a level of cash with respect to the Renaissance System. So typically they would pay for the Renaissance and we will have incremental price difference to pay when we offer it.
Tracy Marshbanks
And does the time vary, you haven't really disclosed it, but I assume itâs well under a year but more than a quarter as far as the time differential to decide?
Sharon Levita
We typically allow between through the extent of Q1 or Q2 of next year just because to manage inventory levels and the backlog.
Tracy Marshbanks
Ori, I know - I think for you, but I know this going to be a little bit of speculation but I'd be interested because of the procedure dynamic because of potentially the competitive dynamic and because of the some unique capabilities of the Renaissance versus the Mazor X. If you were to look out, do you - would you - do you have any thoughts in the US market what the sales of Renaissanceâs to Xâs systems might look like or the installed base of the two, since if you went out to ASCs that's a big number, but obviously the X has some very unique capabilities for major centers, so any thoughts?
Ori Hadomi
I think you're thinking the right direction. I believe that what you will see in the coming year, what we expect to see by the majority of the big instructions and the community hospitals will probably go with the Mazor X. We believe that given the price adjustment and the repositioning of the Renaissance and targeting our marketing effort on small hospitals and ASC there is a great opportunity also there. in the past, we did sold several systems to ASCs, now when we're doing it together with Medtronic, I hope and believe we will be able in the future to come with some packages that will make the Renaissance even more attractive to these ASCs. Right now, Mazor is independent with its effort with Renaissance on ASCs and I believe there is opportunity there. As to the proportion, I don't want to give you the right now numbers because it's too early. I think it will be fair to say that the vast majority of the system during 2017 is expected to be Mazor X.
Tracy Marshbanks
But if you were to look - this is where we get totally speculative, I went out five years, I was thinking more, what is the sort of installed base opportunity longer term that you may think about for the two systems?
Ori Hadomi
Right. So if you're looking at the US market, we always use two different numbers to estimate the addressable market. So if you're looking at the academic centers and the community hospitals, they are altogether about 5,500 and if we use some criterions to sort these addressable markets to focus on what is the achievable addressable market for the Mazor X, we believe that it something between 1,200 to 1,500 hospitals. However, on top of that there are about 10,000 service centers in the US, it is hard to - we couldn't find exact numbers about in how many of these spine fusions, spine surgery is done. We want to believe and we believe itâs a reasonable number to assume that at least in 10% of these. So if you want to see to look at addressable markets to assume that there is something close to 1,500 an addressable market for the Mazor X into hospitals and additional about 1,000 for ASCs where we would potentially could fill the Renaissance I think these are fair number.
Tracy Marshbanks
I truly helpful and I assume what you're referring to on the ASCs with Medtronic, ASCs are very expensive right for a small companies too, if you will service and stock and the like. And so with Medtronic, Iâll call it logistics and reach. That's the issue that may really open up new offerings for the ASCs?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. Remember in the future, we don't -- the answer is yes, we will definitely plan to gain the benefit also as the Medtronic outreach.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Weâll go next to Robert [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. First, Ori, can you give us an indication as to the new orders, does it include any brain modules?
Ori Hadomi
No, they're not included, brain modules. 
Unidentified Analyst
All right. And you sold one into the Chinese markets, could you give us a little more color on that and how you see that market developing and expanding and the question of IP protection surrounding that?
Ori Hadomi
Yeah. In China, we are working through our distributor, Cicel, and we believe we have -- we've put in place strong and responsible IP protection strategy and we are very satisfied as of today with our activity with Cicel. Thatâs all what I can say.
Operator
At this time, it appears we have no further questions. I'd like to turn back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.
Ori Hadomi
So thank you, everyone for attending this call. Weâre looking forward for a very successful fourth quarter and weâre looking forward to talking with you following the end of this year. Thank you, everyone and good day. Good Election Day.
Operator
Weâd like to thank everybody for their participation on todayâs conference call. Please feel free to disconnect your line at any time.
