Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IMS Health Third Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, October 24, 2014. 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tom Kinsley
Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss IMS Healthâs third quarter 2014 performance. With me today are Ari Bousbib, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Bruehlman, the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today weâll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on the webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on our Events and Presentation section of the Investor Relations website. The IR website is easily found in the top right-hand corner of imshealth.com. 
Before we begin our prepared remarks, Iâd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance, our pending transaction with Cegedim, and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, October 24, 2014. Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are in fact achieved will depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
During this presentation, weâll refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and unlevered free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items, and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. 
Now Iâll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone. Iâd like to thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. Third quarter is essentially a continuation of the solid momentum that weâve had since the beginning of the year. Third quarter revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were strong and entirely consistent with our second quarter performance on a constant currency basis. In fact, if you exclude the significant headwinds we faced from currencies, this was a repeat of the second quarter performance.
At constant currency, revenue growth was again 5.4% in the quarter, and excluding the impact of acquisitions growth was again about 4%. Revenue in our key growth areas â tech services and emerging markets â again grew double digits on a constant currency basis. Tech services continued to gain traction, growing 10.8%, with particular strength in our tech and apps and real-world evidence offerings. Information offerings grew 1.8% again at constant currency. 
Emerging markets revenue increased 10.5% and developed markets grew 4.5% before the impact of FX. Adjusted EBITDA grew 10.5% and EBITDA margins improved about 160 basis points at constant currency as we continued to execute against our cost reduction programs. 
In the quarter, I do want to signal a couple of important technology deals that we won. I want to highlight first a big win which was a multi-year agreement with UCB. UCB will deploy the Nexxus application suite and IMS One Intelligent Cloud, including our applications for marketing, sales planning, incentive compensation, performance management, mobile sales, and master data management. In fact, the only Nexxus application that is not included in this very large deal is our customer relationship management solution, but I am pleased to report that our Nexxus suite will link seamlessly with Cegedimâs mobile intelligence application which is UCBâs current CRM system.
I want to highlight another significant multi-year agreement that we just won both for our Nexxus MDM and CRM applications, and thatâs for another global pharmaceutical company. In this case, the client had recently deployed our Nexxus marketing and Nexxus performance management applications. The efficiency they gained from these interoperable applications made it obvious to them that the natural next step was to add our MDM and CRM solutions so that theyâd complete the full suite of Nexxus applications deployed within the commercial operation of that pharma company. By the way, in this case we will be displacing another third party SAAS-based CRM solution. Of course, the entire suite will be here again powered by the IMS One Intelligent Cloud. These two examples demonstrate that our customers increasingly recognize the compelling value and power of IMS One and of our Nexxus suite of offerings. 
Now before handing off to Ron, let me take a minute to update you on the status of our proposed acquisition of certain information solutions and CRM businesses of Cegedim. Last week we announced the execution of a definitive purchase agreement for this deal. This followed the successful completion of works council information and various consultation requirements as well as the formal approval of the transaction by the Cegedim board of directors. Weâre pleased to achieve this important milestone and continue to be very enthusiastic about the progress of our pre-integration planning as we move towards closing. The deal, of course, continues to be subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We donât have a date certain for these approvals. Our best estimate, given the time it takes to go procedurally through all of these regulatory approvals, our best estimate is that we will close the transaction sometime in the first part of 2015 and most likely early in the second quarter. 
We have reached out to our many customers to explain the acquisition and we have received very positive reactions. They understand the strategic rationale and see the value of bringing together the complementary offerings of IMS and Cegedim, and understand how this will bring more choice to the marketplace. The more we learn about these Cegedim assets, the stronger I feel about what Iâve said before â the fit is great, the price is right, and the upside if we execute is even better.
Now Iâd like to turn it over to Ron Bruehlman, our Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the third quarter financials in more detail.
Ronald Bruehlman
Okay. Thanks Ari, and good morning everyone. Now as Ari mentioned, the third quarter financial performance and the related growth rates were strong and really quite similar to those of the second quarter on a constant currency basis. As you know, weâre a very global business with a little over 60% of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., therefore the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar since the second quarter has impacted our reported results. Iâll have more on currency later, but let me first walk you through the revenue and adjusted EBITDA details.
In the quarter, revenue increased 5.4% on a constant currency basis, or 3.7% on a reported basis. The constant currency revenue growth was again driven by technology services, which increased 10.8% with continued double-digit tech and apps and real-world evidence growth. On a reported basis, technology services revenue grew 9.3%. Information revenue was up 1.8% constant currency, mainly due to growth in emerging markets. Info revenue was flat on a reported basis. Total revenue in emerging markets increased 10.4% constant currency, reflecting mid-teens growth in technology services and high single-digit growth in information. On a reported basis, emerging markets revenue growth was 4.6% with a significant revaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar that we did at June 30 this year responsible for more than half of the unfavorable FX impact. 
Growth in developed markets was 4.3% constant currency, driven by 10% tech services growth and half a point of growth in information offerings. Reported growth for developed markets was 3.5%.
Turning to adjusted EBITDA, for the quarter it was up 10.5% on a constant currency basis or 6.1% reported to $221 million. As Ari highlighted, in the quarter our adjusted EBITDA margin grew by 159 basis points on a constant currency basis as we continue to execute against our cost reduction initiative. On a reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin improved 76 basis points to 33.7%, and the difference was due to the varying profitability of our different currencies, our countries in different currencies. The sizeable FX headwind in the quarter reflected a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most foreign currencies. In addition, youâll recall that at June 30 we revalued the Venezuelan bolivar from 6.3 to 50 to the dollar, and during last quarterâs earnings call we projected this would have a negative impact of about $10 million on revenue and $6 million on adjusted EBITDA in the second half. Consistent with those expectations, we realized about half of that unfavorable impact in the third quarter.
Now letâs go back to the P&L. GAAP net income was $47 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $20 million last year. Adjusted net income in the third quarter was $125 million, down less than a point at constant currency and down 6.3% on a reported basis versus last year, and what we saw was our adjusted EBITDA growth and lower interest expense were more than offset by an unusual $47 million tax refund received in last yearâs third quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.14 in the third quarter compared with a loss per share of $0.07 in the prior year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.37 in the third quarter compared to $0.47 in 2013, reflecting the decline in adjusted net income and a higher average share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding increased from 285 million in last yearâs third quarter to 342 million this year, and the reason of course was the recent IPO. FX had a $0.02 negative impact on adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year. 
Looking at the year-to-date numbers, through September revenue increased 5.8% constant currency and an even 5% reported, and for the nine months at constant currency tech services revenue grew 11.7% and emerging markets increased 11.2%. Adjusted EBITDA year-to-date was up 9.8% constant currency and 7.5% reported. Adjusted net income increased 11.6% constant currency and 7.6% reported, and finally adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.02 through September versus $1.06 in 2013. FX had a $0.03 negative impact versus prior year on a year-to-date basis.
Now letâs go to the balance sheet for a few minutes. As of September 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $355 million, and debt was $3.9 billion, resulting in net debt of $3.6 billion. Our gross leverage ratio improved to 4.5 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, which is about a turn and a half lower than year-end 2013. Cash flow from operations was $191 million in the quarter compared with $212 million last year, but excluding last yearâs federal tax refund, operating cash flow would have increased $26 million year-over-year. 
As you will recall from our last two earnings releases, we track a measure of cash flow we call unlevered free cash flow, which we reconcile and detail in the press release. Unlevered free cash flow was strong during the third quarter, totaling $216 million and 98% of adjusted EBITDA, compared with $222 million in the same quarter of 2013. Excluding last yearâs tax refund, unlevered free cash flow would have increased by $41 million year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures in addition to deferred software were up by a total of $10 million, reflecting increased investment in new product development and also the build-out of certain real estate assets, including our new Bangalore global delivery center.
Letâs turn to the guidance now. Our medium term guidance remains unchanged at mid-single digit revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.5 times the rate of revenue growth. Youâll recall on our last earnings call, we reiterated our full-year 2014 guidance of 5 to 6% revenue growth and 7.5 to 9% adjusted EBITDA growth, which was at that time about 1.5 times revenue growth. This forecast assumed that exchange rates as of June 30 would continue through the balance of the year; however, the dramatic movement that we saw in foreign currency rates and that we have seen in foreign currency rates since June requires us to adjust elements of our guidance on a reported basis. 
Consistent with previous guidance and on a constant currency basis, we now expect full-year revenue growth of 5.5 to 5.7%, and full-year EBITDA growth of 9 to 9.8%, or a little better than 1.5 times revenue growth. To reiterate, these numbers are at constant currency. Taking into account the strengthening of the dollar during the third quarter and assuming exchange rates as of Wednesday remain constant through the end of the year, FX will negatively impact full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth by 1.7 percentage points and 3.2 percentage points respectively. As a result, for the full year our guidance for reported revenue growth is now 3.8 to 4.0%, and for reported adjusted EBITDA growth is now 5.8 to 6.6%. 
Our full-year guidance for adjusted net income growth is now 20 to 21% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, including FX, we are narrowing our guidance for adjusted net income growth to 15 to 16%, and this remains within our previously issued guidance range despite the adverse impact of FX. Again, I want to emphasize that all the revisions to our reported guidance are entirely due to changes in FX rate. We have not changed our constant currency guidance. You will note we have added guidance for full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.42 on a constant currency basis, and $1.34 to $1.36 on a reported basis. 
Youâll recall that during the second quarter call, we noted we would revisit our unlevered free cash flow guidance at the end of the third quarter, and weâre now projecting that unlevered free cash flow, excluding the large and very unusual building purchase in Bangalore, will fall between 70 and 75% of adjusted EBITDA. This is a little bit lower than our historic 80% average, and the reason is higher capital expenditures and product development investments weâre making to grow the business, particularly in the technology services area, and a few other factors unique to this year such as significant prepayments that we have made this year upon signing certain strategic vendor contracts. 
Now recognizing the importance of FX rates to our results, and also recognizing that the only thing certain about rates is that theyâll be different than any assumption we or you could make, a few of you have asked for rules of thumb for estimating the impact of currency changes on our results, so here goes. In the hypothetical scenario where the value of the U.S. dollar changes 1% versus our entire basket of currencies, there would be about a $15 million impact on full-year revenue, upward or downward depending on which way the dollar is going. The euro and Japanese yen would account for slightly over half of this impact, and let me be more specific â a 1% change in the value of the dollar versus the euro would result in about a 6 to $7 million full-year impact to revenue. A 1% change in the value of the dollar versus the yen would result in about a $2.5 million full-year revenue impact, and finally a 1% change in dollar versus all of our other currencies collectively would result in approximately a $6 million revenue impact. If you do the math, these three impacts add to about $15 million.
Of course, keep in mind we do business in over 60 currencies and not all will move in the same direction by the same amount at the same time, so our purpose in providing these rules of thumb is not to predict exactly what will happen as currencies move but simply to help you understand the potential impact of movement. 
In closing, we had another strong quarter with very solid operating results consistent with our performance throughout the year. This included continued double-digit constant currency growth in technology services revenue with notable strength in tech and apps and real-world evidence. We also booked important deals with life sciences customers for IMS One Intelligent Cloud and also our Nexxus suite of commercial applications, which provides further evidence of our success expanding our addressable market. Finally, we moved an important step closer to closing the Cegedim transaction with completion of works council consultation requirements and the approval by Cegedimâs board of directors.
With that, I will ask our operator, Suzy, to open the lines for Q&A.
Question and Answer Session

Operator
[Operator instructions]
Our first question is coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik â Barclays
Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Ari, the first question I had was just on the tech services line. Clearly over the last several quarters, youâve talked about a lot ofâI should say youâve highlighted a lot of new wins, and the ones you highlighted today seemed pretty impressive as well. I was just wondering, in terms of the growth rate, it seems like that number has decelerated a bit. Is that just an issue of comps, or how should we think about what that normalized growth rate going forward is?
Ari Bousbib
Good morning, Manav. Thanks for the question. The pipeline continues to grow on our tech and apps business. Now, remember these are multi-year agreements, so when we sign them that doesnât translate into revenue right away â thatâs the first point I want to make. The second point is the initial stages of those wins when we begin working and engaging with the customers are typically implementation. Thatâs going to last three to six months generally, and that involves more labor â and by the way, thatâs not your question but Iâd tell you that has an impact on our margins obviously, because itâs higher labor content and weâre not yet in the phase where we derive our license revenue from those SAAS applications. So again, weâre very happy to win these deals but they do haveâyou know, they roll in, in terms of the revenue impact, slower, and we remind you the initial revenues are implementation, and number two they also have some tendency to compress our margins on tech services because the initial part is more labor due to the implementation.
Now, bear in mind that what I just said applies to the tech and apps piece of our tech services business. Tech services business is this year well over a billion dollars, and only a fraction, a portion of that is tech and apps. We still have in our business, a business we like but it has a different type of characteristics, which is workflow analytics and the consulting piece of the business, which together comprise somewhere around 45% of our tech services business, and thatâs labor business. 
Now while the tech and apps business, I think this year â Iâm just going to quote from memory here â through the year is upâyou know, the Nexxus applications are up more than 40% year-over-year. I donât know if we discussed this or not, or if we should, but Iâm just telling you itâs doing really well, but itâs still a small part of the tech services in aggregate. Nearly half of the business is still workflow analytics, which is labor-based, and we also have consulting in there, and those two businesses maybe were a bit disappointing in the quarter, that we saw them grow more in the single digits, maybe low to mid-single digits in some areas. Thatâs more, especially on the consulting side, more discretionary, so that mightâthat may have an impact on our overall tech services growth. 
Again, on the tech and apps business, itâs going great. The Nexxus business is growing more than 40% since the beginning of the year consistently, and fluctuations in tech services, up and down one or two points, really willâare mostly driven by the labor-based part of the tech services business, the workflow analytics and the consulting. 
Hope that gives you more color.
Manav Patnaik â Barclays
Yeah, thatâs helpful. If I could just ask one more, just around M&A. The first part, just from a modeling perspective, Ron, if you can remind us when all the current acquisitions, I guess, that you already have done annualize, so you get to more of a constant currency equals organic growth-type number? Then just a general comment, maybe from you, Ari, on the pipeline even with the Cegedim deal in the works.
Ronald Bruehlman
On the first part of your question, Manav, there really is going to be no point at which the organic and the reported growth equalize, because we continue to do acquisitions every quarter. So yeah, weâll pass the anniversary of a given acquisition, but weâll have new acquisitions coming in all the time, so the only thing we can do is try to give you some indication of how acquisitions are contributing on a quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year.
Ari Bousbib
Right. And Manav, if you step back, our guidance (indiscernible) was mid-single digit revenue growth in the medium term, and certainly for this year we were more on the upper end of that guidance in the 5 to 6%, and today weâve narrowed that down further into 5.5 to 5.7% for the balance of theâfor the year. Now, weâve always said that this guidance â mid-single digit revenue growth, which means 4 to 6% - includes approximately one point of acquisitions. It turns out since the beginning of the year, I think itâs moreâitâs been this year more around 1.5 or so points . Weâve done a little bit more than the one point guidance. But again, the actual revenue growth will be more towards the high end of that 4 to 6% guidance, so thatâs the story on acquisitions.
Frankly, I expect that once we do Cegedim, which is significant and large, we will want to understand the impact of that large acquisition on the rest, it being that understood that in and out we will be doing some tuck-in acquisitions. Some years, it might just be half a point of acquisition contribution, some year 1.5, as this year. But again, on average in the medium term, it will be about a point of contribution.
Manav Patnaik â Barclays
Okay. All right, thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Steinerman â JP Morgan
Good morning, Ron. You can imagine, Iâm about to go through some organic constant currency growth questions. So if I look at the 5.4 constant currency growth reported in the quarter and I take out the point and a half that Ari cited for M&A, itâs about 4% organic constant currency in the quarter, same as last quarter. If I remember right, all the acquisitions are in tech services, so info services is organic already. I take out the acquisitions, the organic growth in tech services looks like 8% to me in the quarter. Is that right?
Ronald Bruehlman
Andrew, I think youâre in the ballpark. Weâre not going to give precise breakdowns of organic growth between tech and apps and information, but the acquisitions in the quarter were largely tech servicesâ
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, not 100% but obviously a majorityâthe large majority. I think the numbers you quote, Andrew, are essentially on the mark.
Andrew Steinerman â JP Morgan
Right, and thatâs, by the way, the same as last quarter, so when I look at organic of tech services, it looks like steady, strong growth to me.
Ronald Bruehlman
Yeah, we would agree.
Andrew Steinerman â JP Morgan
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Suzy Stein with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Toni Kaplan â Morgan Stanley
Hi, this is Toni on for Suzy. Thanks for the color on the FX rates. Weâre just wondering, are there any changes that you plan to make on your hedging strategy, or are you really comfortable with the current strategy? Basically trying to get at whether you would consider trying to hedge more so that while revenue might be impacted by currency, you could try to hedge out the FX risk on EBITDA and on earnings. Thanks. 
Ronald Bruehlman
Okay, let me take that. I think on the last call, or might have been on the first call, we talked a little bit about our hedge strategy. Our hedge strategy really consists of two components: one, we have a natural hedge due to our euro-denominated term loan. The euro-based interest offsets a portion, a small portion of our euro-based earnings. We also hedge our royalties, foreign currency royalties in several key currencies such as the euro, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, the yen. But thatâs about the limit of what we can do in terms of hedging under the accounting rules, so to dramatically change our hedging strategy on earnings would not be possible.
Now, there wasnât a big impact, a positive impact from hedging in the quarter â it was about $1 million favorable, and I remind you that all the hedging impact comes below the adjusted EBITDA line in other income and interest expense. The reason for that was the currencies that moved a lot in the quarter were not those that we could hedge â for instance, the Venezuelan bolivar, obviously you canât hedge that, and we also have the situation in the U.K. where the U.K. pound strengthened but we have a lot of general corporate sort of expenses, where we do services in the U.K. for other parts of the world, so the U.K. pound was the one currency that strengthened and we have no ability to hedge that, and it actually ended up hurting us because we run a net loss in the U.S. That also helps explain why we had the big variation between our margin in actual FX and margin in constant FX.
Okay. In another quarter, fourth quarter, weâll probably have more benefit out FX hedging than we do now, but quarter to quarter itâs going to bounce around a lot and thereâs not much we can do about it.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, I just want to also point out, weâve mentioned it a number of times and itâs complicated, but we did take a hit on the bolivar, a one-time hit â in other words, youâre going to hear about it through, I guess, the second quarter of next year when we will definitely be out of it. Venezuela is a tiny country for us, but itâs a significant number when you devaluate the currency ten times, by a ratio of 10 to 1. The important point is that will be behind us, right, and itâs not a headwind weâll have going forward. 
Many, many companies have chosen to leave it as is in the interest of not hurting their quarterly earnings. Weâve decided to put it behind us.
Ronald Bruehlman
Although let me clarify on that. The valuation is behind us. Youâll continue to see FX impacts in the Venezuelan currency in the fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter; and once we hit the anniversary, hopefully we wonât have to talk about Venezuela ever again.
Toni Kaplan â Morgan Stanley
Okay, thanks for the color on that. Just one follow-up â you mentioned a few large specific deals in the comments earlier, and congratulations on closing those. How much did those add to growth this quarter, and how long are the contracts for? And then also when we think about tech services and future growth there, how much should we think about from greenfield opportunities versus displacing other vendors?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, so on the first question, those deals contributed exactly zero in the quarter because we just signed them and we are in the initial stages in terms of revenue, and I take it thatâs what you mean. They are typically multi-year, so itâs a minimum of three years, and they are fairly large. In some cases, these types of deals could be several thousand, million dollars over three years. 
On theâwhat was the other part of your question?
Toni Kaplan â Morgan Stanley
The greenfield versus displacing other vendors.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, not quite sure exactly what you mean, greenfield versus displacing other vendors. In most cases, our clientsâyou know, it depends on what applications, right? So for example on the CRM side, most pharma companies have form of a CRM application, either from a third party vendor or in-house grown. In other areas like marketing, performance management, social media tracking and so on, typically these are not services that our clients have utilized in the past. They have been manual, labor-based, internal workflows, and what our Nexxus applications provide is an ability to automate those processes in order to create efficiencies and reach better quality and deeper insights with our clientsâ customers. So itâs really a mixed bag. Thank you.
Toni Kaplan â Morgan Stanley
Thanks for your time.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Stockton â Wells Fargo
Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe first, Ron, on the FX front, can you give us some color on how it might have impacted (indiscernible), so for example SG&A came in, I would say a fair amount below most peopleâs expectations during the quarter. Was that FX driven, or was there more of a cost containment effort that helped to drive that? And then conversely, your cost of services, I would say were higher. Was there a foreign exchange impact there, or was that, especially in the tech services business, some infrastructure build? I know Ari said earlier that there may have been a mix shift toward more implementation work, but if you could just give us some color on that so we can understand how margins are going to trend incrementally, thatâd be great. 
Ronald Bruehlman
Yes, let me take that. FX had an impact on all of the lines in our P&L. I donât have the precise breakdown in front of me, other than what we gave you on the various components like revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, EPS, so forth. Now on the SG&A side specifically, it was a combination of a little bit of FX but also a lot of reduction in cost, in cost control. In fact, if you look at SG&A as a percentage of revenue, you see it drops fairly significantly, so there is good news there from an operating standpoint.
Now to your question specifically about technology services costs and technology services margins, yes, in fact there was some FX impact mix-related that hurt us there, but weâre also making investments in that business, both in data sources and in labor to support the growth in that business, and that also affected our information margins, some of the strategic investments weâre making for future growth. So the underlying margin trends were still quite positive. Yes, there will be going forward some implementation-related drag, as Ari mentioned; but underlying, weâre very comfortable with the margin profile we have, both in information and tech services.
Jamie Stockton â Wells Fargo
Okay, thatâs great. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger â William Blair
Hi, thanks very much. Ari, I believe you mentioned earlier that RWE also had a pretty good quarter. Could you just elaborate on how thatâs going, and is that growth primarily coming from sales into pharma?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. RWE was actually very strong in the quarter, I think high double digits and certainly from the beginning of the year mid double digits, so itâs been strong and accelerating. And yes, the answer is itâs all to pharma. Iâd say that 95% is pharma, yes.
John Kreger â William Blair
Have you been able to link the script and medical plans across multiple geographies, or primarily just in the U.S. at this point?
Ari Bousbib
You know, itâs actually both Europe and in the U.S. I think itâs about 10 markets. We have this collaboration with AstraZeneca in Europe where weâre doing it across multiple European geographies, and then in the U.S., again weâre doing it with a number of our clients. So I think itâs 10 markets where weâve been doing it, and itâs mostly Europe and the U.S.
John Kreger â William Blair
One last one â have you decided at this point what to do about your couple CRM platforms once the Cegedim deal closes? Are you going to keep them both, or consolidate?
Ari Bousbib
We are not going to do thisâmake that decision now. For now, we are finding that there are benefits to both platforms. Some clients prefer a private environment, a private type of cloud, and thatâs what mobile intelligence offers. Some clients are fine moving to a Salesforce.com-type support platform, and thatâs what we offer. We are going to continue to maintain that choice and flexibility at this point. Weâre finding that from a customer standpoint, itâs got a lot of value.
Now having said that, and we havenât made the decision because we havenât been yet able to close on Cegedim, and we will once we are in, but weâve already started formulating some thoughts in terms of putting together obviously a bunch of the R&D of the development, of the software folks, the infrastructure, the management of the platforms and so on. There are a number ofâthere is some advantage for both, on both platforms that we can try to combine on the back end. But the front end, we would like at this point at least, and thatâs where our thinking is, to maintain the choice for our customers, and they like that. 
In fact, some of our clientsâI mentioned before we spoke to many of our clients, and they like that optionality. Some clients are really very enamored with the mobile intelligence platform of Cegedim, and they were actually concerned that we would switch it, so we were quick to reassure them. At the same time, we continue to push our own public cloud-based CRM application, and as we mentioned before it is meeting with success in the marketplace as well. 
John Kreger â William Blair
Great, thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Sandy Draper with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Sandy Draper â SunTrust
Thanks very much. Maybe just Ari, going back to the deals that you mentioned, and I may have asked a related question a couple quarters ago, when youâre looking at these larger deals, is there any specific tipping point that youâre seeing that causes the customer to make a decision? You know, they start with one product and then they come in and you broadly sell them; they come to you and say, hey, we need an IT overhaul. Iâm just trying to understand, what are the decision points? And then maybe a follow-up on the one where you replaced a SAAS-based CRM product, is that something again that youâre finding a lot of unhappiness with other products in the marketplace? Theyâre coming to you because theyâre using you for other stuff? Iâm just trying to understand why someone switching from a newer platform, assuming itâs SAAS and was a reasonably recent buy, what makes them make that decision to switch. Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Right. So again in terms of the first part of your question, which is what causes someone to decide to buy our products, itâs all of the above â that is, youâve got people who have legacy applications either home-grown or third party, and they see increasingly the benefit of a one-stop shop type, for lack of simpler terminology, of application. This is especially true for medium sized pharma, right? The very large, letâs say the top 15 global pharma companies typically have more entrenched relationships, tend to have bigger internal IT organizations that are married, letâs say, for CRM to CBOE, or for MDM to Oracle or to someone else, or to Accenture for another type of application. So you know, they will tend to be reluctant to make switches across the board.
Medium sized pharma, which is companies â you know, the 5, $10 billion type of revenue, which the two examples I mentioned are in that category, first of all, we like them a lot because they are typically higher growth, but they want to quickly get to the leading edge type of platforms and they are much more receptive to bringing in several applications at once. Now once they do that, once they buy one application, the barriers to entry, if you will, are considerably lower, and as we mentioned many times, the interoperability of our application is a big plus from an IT point of view. It is simply from a technical standpoint a lot more elegant, and it facilitates changes, it makes the operability of the system very easy because itâs a consistent type of platform, itâs one vendor. Obviously you always have theâas a counter to this, youâve got the procurement type of approach, which says we donât want to give everything to the same guy, and we want to sort of split the spend to maintain competition. But you know, in these areas, clients see more and more the benefits of having one partner, if you will, as opposed to just a simple vendor. We donât typically throw these applications over the wall. We continue to work in a very integrated manner with our clients on an ongoing basis.
The second part of your question- what causes? Again, I think itâs simply again the interoperability. Iâm not going to say that there was in this particular case dissatisfaction with the CRM vendor that they had, who happens to be very, very good and very successful in the marketplace. But they saw the benefit of adding that application across the board. 
The first example that I gave, which we disclosed the name of because they authorized us to do so â UCB, they had Cegedimâs mobile intelligence platform and they decided they were happy with it. They donât want to change to our Nexxus CRM platform or to anybody elseâs platform. They wanted to keep for their own reasons mobile intelligence; but again, we seamlessly can link that into our Nexxus suite and host that also on our platform. It was all perfectly fine with UCB.
In the other case, they decided they wanted the whole enchilada after buying just performance management and, I believe, the marketing application. They decided they also wanted master data management and also CRM, again based on the benefits, and as a result we displaced the incumbent SAAS-based CRM provider, who again thereâs nothing wrong with them, they are actually very good.
Sandy Draper â SunTrust
Great, thatâs really helpful color, Ari. Maybe one just quick follow-up, Ron â can you just remind us where we are in terms of the cost saving targets that you guys have laid out, how far along and how much is left? Thanks.
Ronald Bruehlman
Well, the first thing I would say is the cost savings targets are never 100% static. Weâre always looking for new cost savings ideas, and we do this every quarter when we have our operating reviews around the world. But that being said, we did show you some cost saving targets when we were at the IPO time, and I think at the beginning of the year we said we were about two-thirds through those targets. Weâre probably somewhere in the 75% through those targets as we exit the year this year; but again, the cost targets are never static. Weâre always looking for new opportunities, and the Cegedim transaction will bring us a number of those opportunities, just as a for instance.
Sandy Draper â SunTrust
Great, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Hi, good morning. This is actually Elizabeth Blake in for Bob Willoughby today. So I know that Cegedim is set to report on Tuesday, but could you offer any comment on the performance there?
Ari Bousbib
On Cegedim, you mean?
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, I think itâs basically on target, from what I have seen. I canât comment much more than that â you know, Iâm not privy to more than what they published, and their results are either on target or better than target, from what Iâve seen.
Ronald Bruehlman
Yeah, and this is looking back at the published first half results, of course. Weâre not commenting on what they may release coming up, but their first half results were quite good.
Ari Bousbib
Actually a little bit better, right, than what we thought?
Ronald Bruehlman
Yeah.
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Right, okay. As you progress further toward a deal close, any better sense of how quickly you could exit maybe some office or facility leases where there might be overlap to geographically, or any update on the employee retention at Cegedim? Iâm just trying to think about synergies.
Ari Bousbib
On employee retention, you mean?
Ronald Bruehlman
Yeah, thereâs two questions â employee retentionâ
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
As well as any office leases. Do you have a better sense of maybe when you could exit some of those agreements if thereâs overlap?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, again, we will try to go as fast as we can after we close. I think our best guess is sometime in the second quarterly, hopefully. The first initiative, the early part of the second quarter we should close, and then weâll try to have a running a start. Weâve done a lot of work ourselves, but it takes time. Leases are what they are â thereâs a cost to breaking them. We will evaluate one by one. I donât anticipate, frankly, any realization of anything significant in terms of costs and takeouts in the 2015, because itâs just going to be the integration and all of that will start flowing through hopefully beginning in â16. But it takes time to do all of that. Itâs a global company as well, you know?
Ronald Bruehlman
And real estate is just one of the many things weâll be looking at to (indiscernible).
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Okay, thatâs helpful. Thanks. Finally withâam I still on?
Ari Bousbib
Yes, go ahead.
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Okay. Finally, with regulators cracking down on inversions lately, do you have any updated thoughts with regard to M&A among manufacturers? Are you expecting more divestitures and breakupsâ
Ari Bousbib
You mean the pharma mergers?
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
Yeah. I mean, look â that topic comprised the main substance of our previous earnings call, at least two calls ago, and as it turns out it hasnât quite happened the way we wereâthe way the headlines seemed to indicate at the time. So despite the fact that many have insisted that those mergers were not driven by tax benefits, as soon as those tax benefits went away, some of those mergers went away as well. So I donât know. I canât comment much more than that.
The type of impact that we had discussed, some of the mergers had gone, I believe. For example, the Novartis, GSK type of joint ventures â isnât Novartis-GSK, the joint venture, that went through the multi-exchanges of different businesses? But again, I would say the impact so far, what has happened or is likely to happen based on the information we know today is negligible.
Elizabeth Blake â Bank of America
Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Appert â Piper Jaffray
Thanks. So Ari or Ron, can you give us some big picture perspective on what youâre seeing in the pricing environment? Iâm wondering, one, how important pricing is to the organic revenue growth; and then two, if youâre seeing any increased pressure or pushback from clients from a pricing perspective.
Ari Bousbib
Well look, weâve made that comment before â in previous history long ago, in a previous reincarnation, IMS used to raise prices aggressively on its info products regularly, and the reason for doing that was because they could. We have deliberately walked away from this. We are interested in expanding the pie with our clients. Weâve moved away from a data-centric model to a customer-centric model. We are pushing our tech services business because we believe itâs a much bigger, larger addressable market and one that grows at a faster rate, and therefore we will deliberately be very cautious on pricing in the interest of market share gains and penetration on our tech services. So even when we have pricing abilities, we will shy away from that.
Now, we do have some pricing increase thatâs regular, but our pricing matrix has 400 pricing points and depending on the combination of products, on average we do get some benefit from pricing but itâs marginal. Thatâs not whatâs driving organic growth one way or the other. Organic growth, as we said before, if you look at our guidance and my own words before, is going to be within the 4 to 6% or mid-single digit revenue growth that weâve given before, and that I said includes about a point â this year, itâs about a point and a half. I think this year, organic growth in the first quarter was about 5%, second and third quarter was about 4%. For the year, we are a little over 4% year-to-date â thatâs well within our guidance. I looked at some of our peers that have released their numbers, and their organic growth is in the 2 to 3% range when you peel out all the fluff, so Iâm not going to apologize for 4%-plus organic growth, which Iâm very happy with. 
Now having said that, would I like to have higher organic growth rate, and are we striving for a higher organic growth rate? Yes, not on the back of pricing, to your question, but on the back of real volume growth in the marketplace. And why is the growth rate not higher than 4%, even though again Iâm happy with the 4%, butâbear in mind, our business, we do business in 100 countries. Small movements of many, many moveable parts can affect that growth rate dramatically. In a given quarter, one point of revenue for us is about $6 million, and if you look at this past quarter, and Iâve done that in excruciating detail, you look at our emerging markets for example, itâs grown consistent with our 11% or so growth rate that weâve had in the past. But would I have liked to have that growth rate a little higher? Yes. And why hasnât it been higher this quarter than I would have hoped? Well, weâve had China, which as you know has been growing at more than 20% historically, went down to 10%-ish last year in the midst of that crisis with GSK, and it has come back a little but itâs moreâyou know, China has been growing more like 14, 15%, which is shy of the 20% that we were hoping for. Weâve had Venezuela, not the currency situation but the economy deteriorate dramatically, so in Venezuela our business has also gone down a lot. Again, itâs a small country but it adds up, and the reason why in Venezuela the economy has gone down, people donât medicines anymore, therefore our clients donât buy the data.
I mentioned last quarter that the Mexico distribution chain went bankrupt, had liquidity issues, and as a result manufacturers had difficulties pushing product through the channels. I mean, that chain had about 30% market share. The problems there have continued in Mexico, so if you combine Mexico and Venezuela and China and a couple of other places, thatâs easily 2, $3 million that should have materialized in the quarter that didnât materialize.
Then in tech services, I mentioned before our growth rate is good, itâs double digits. Would I have liked it to be somewhat higher organically? Yes. Why is it not higher in the quarter? I mentioned that the workflow analytics, the consulting, a couple of projects slipped, so that could be another couple of million dollars. So pretty soonâand I mentioned the Japan issue as well, where we have price cuts one year in, one year out. This year is the year where the government imposes price reductions. That has an impact on our business.
When you combine it all, itâs easy to see how we lost a point of growth, about 5, $6 million. So again, Iâm very happy with my 4% organic growth rate this quarter. Through the year, three quarters, itâs over 4%, which is, I think, way better than some of our peers. Would I have liked it to inch more towards the 5%? Yes, and I just gave you the reasons for why that wasnât so â a lot of movable parts, and small gyrations one way or the other can make a difference of half a point to a point.
So thatâs, I guess, maybe a longer answer than you wanted, but hopefully it gives you more depth and granularity and understanding of our organic growth rate.
Peter Appert â Piper Jaffray
Yes, thatâs very helpful. Thanks.
Tom Kinsley
Okay, weâve moved past the top of the hour, and I know youâve got a lot of calls, so thanks for taking the time to join us today and weâll look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
