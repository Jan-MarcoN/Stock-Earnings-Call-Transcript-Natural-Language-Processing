Good morning, and welcome to the First Connecticut Bancorp, Inc. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After todayâs presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note that this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jennifer Daukas. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Daukas
Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. My name is Jennifer Daukas and Iâm the Investor Relations Officer for the company.
Before we begin our presentation, I would like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcements. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor afforded by that advisement.
Thank you. And now here is John Patrick, our Chairman, President and CEO.
John Patrick
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call this busy day. I just want to reiterate a few things in our release. Weâre pleased with our results this quarter considering the operating environment that weâre in and this interest rate environment that weâre in.
Our quarter was really driven by strong organic loan growth and deposit growth, and this nice composition of consumer loans both on the C&I side and CRE loans. You may or may not recall that last year at this time we discussed our desire to hold our residential loan portfolio effectively flat, around 850 million, and as you can see weâre achieving the desired effect resulting in balance sheet loan composition of 58% commercial and 42% consumer, which is primarily residential and home equity.
We continue to work diligently on becoming more operationally efficient, I think is evidenced by our non-interest expense being down year-over-year by 2%. And I think thatâs important to put that in perspective during that timeframe. Weâve opened up three new branch offices and continued to maintain diligent â look at our operating expenses and ensuring that we focus on operational efficiencies.
Even though that we continue to have good loan growth and we have a considerable more portion in commercial loans, our asset quality remains very stable. And just to point that out, again, that when you take a look at our non-performing assets, 94% of our non-performing assets are current. So I think that that gives you a good idea relative to performance on where we are from a lending perspective.
Overall, during the quarter, we opened up our Vernon office. We have seen very good results as we have in our other de novo offices there. Weâre off to a great start in achieving really core operating and demand deposit accounts. We are in excess of what we would anticipate our breakeven point to be in that office only four weeks into it, and the office continues to grow daily.
Year-over-year, we continue to build new customer relationships and that's evidenced by growth of over 6,000 net new accounts year-over-year. So we are focusing in on our core business which we've talked about, taking in deposits and in making good loans. Thatâs whatâs driving our earnings. We canât control the outside effects and influences of the interest rate environment but we will certainly be focusing on operational efficiency and making sure the assets that we put on our balance sheet are of the highest quality.
Iâll turn it over to Greg. Thereâs a couple of items on the income statement that merit a discussion; one, relative to the mortgage servicing rates and the allowance.
Gregory White
Thanks, John. A couple of things, Iâll start by commenting on our net interest income on a core basis, which basically adjust for prepayment penalties. That was flat quarter-over-quarter. That can be seen in the non-GAAP table, which is the last page of our press release. There you can also see our core operating margin was down a basis point to 281 in the second quarter from 282 in the first quarter.
As John mentioned a few other kind of non-recurring or at least infrequently recurring items; one being the impairment on our servicing asset. That was $374,000 and that was offset for the most â yes, it was offset by we had a change in accounting estimate which resulted in a $423,000 reduction to our reserve for off-balance sheet commitments, meaning on advance lines of credit, if you will. So those were kind of the two larger non-core items for the quarter.
So the bottom line is our core earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.22 compared to $0.23 for the first quarter, but if you adjust for the difference in the provision expense, kind of the standard provision expense if you will, then with the second quarter being quite a bit higher than the first quarter, then our core EPS in the second quarter was about $0.02 higher than Q1 with the adjusted provision expense. So obviously as John mentioned, a good quarter.
John Patrick
Great. Understanding you all have a very busy day as do we, weâll open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Damon DelMonte from KBW. Go ahead.
Damon DelMonte
Hi. Good morning, guys. Howâs it going?
John Patrick
Good morning, Damon.
Gregory White
Good morning, Damon.
Damon DelMonte
I guess my first question to start off with loan growth. I think you guys were targeting around 115 million of projected loan growth for 2016. I think youâre around 62 million or so halfway through the year. Just wondering if youâre still comfortable with that guidance, if maybe to be a little bit greater than that or what youâre seeing in the pipeline as we go into the back half of the year?
John Patrick
Yes, I think that our pipelines continue to remain strong, Damon. Weâre confident that the 115 million right now is the right number. Obviously, if we see continued opportunity for the right deals in the marketplace; that may change. Our focus is always for this year, has been to make sure that weâre matching the liability side with the asset side on our deposit growth and our deposit growth year-to-date at the end of the quarter was like 82 million, so thatâs happening. And so weâre very pleased where that is. Weâre just seeing some interesting underwriting in the market. And so that was the reason we talked about the pullback last year. But I think our pipelines are healthy both on the residential side and on the commercial side. Weâre still getting a lot of looks at some very good deals in the marketplace. So there continues to be some disruption in the market and our lenders are positioned to take advantage of that.
Damon DelMonte
Okay. And it seems like a lot of growth continues to come in the commercial real estate side. Any concerns from a regulatory basis as far as the guidelines with commercial real estate as a percent of total capital?
John Patrick
So the regulatory guidance thatâs out there, I donât have a concern. Weâve always talked about that we want to be a regulatory best practices company. And I believe weâve set the risk management framework to do that. When we first started growing our commercial real estate portfolio many years ago, as part of our strategy, we put risk management parameters in place to stress test and do a lot of other things that some companies are just starting to do today, because of the emphasis from the regulatory perspective. So weâve been monitoring it and stress testing that portfolio for several years and we have put guidelines in place from a governance perspective with the Board and have had ongoing discussions frequently in our regulatory exams with the regulators. So I believe everybodyâs very comfortable about our approach about our risk management. Mike can give you some numbers on the quality of that commercial portfolio just to give you an idea of kind of where we are, but Iâm not concerned about that piece of it. And the other thing is I think that thereâs a lot of discussion. Everybody focuses on the 300 where a lot banks are askew from where I can see and really bumping the number is on the 100 side on the construction side, and ours is really de minimis when we take a look at that. So, Mike?
Michael Schweighoffer
Hi, Damon; itâs Mike.
Damon DelMonte
Hi, Mike. How are you?
Michael Schweighoffer
Good. How are you?
Damon DelMonte
Good. Thanks.
Michael Schweighoffer
As John mentioned weâve been tracking various metrics for years within our risk management framework. So one of the things we look at on the investment CRE side is weighted average debt service and weighted average LTV are across the board. Weighted average LTV on the CRE side is 57.1 and 1.77 on a weighted average debt service standpoint. We break it out further by what we call major food groups. So retail, office and apartment and weâve got it all broken down that I can share with you the numbers on a separate call if you like, but weâve got it and the asset quality remains quite good and quite stable.
Damon DelMonte
Okay, thatâs helpful. I appreciate that color. Kind of shifting over to the deposit side, it looks like the now account balances declined pretty sizably from first quarter to second quarter. Was there some seasonality in those numbers, maybe was there municipal-related deposits that went out or something?
John Patrick
Yes, there were municipal deposits and quite frankly Iâm not disappointed in that. The mix is really stronger on our deposit side. So thereâs seasonality in there, Damon. So June 30 fiscal year on most municipalities will pay out a lot of different things, so we see those cash balances go down as of June 30 and then they stop to replenish it. Taxes are collected in Connecticut semiannually and so tax payments come in beginning July 1. But really we donât see the bulk of the payments coming in, in the next couple of weeks. And so weâll see those balances replenish. I do want to note it was I believe last call and I believe it was one of your colleagues Travis Lan had asked on the call with the fiscal challenges in the state of Connecticut, do we see any effect of those fiscal challenges? And I said no, not at the time. But what I would say to you today is that as I take a look at municipalities, they have less cash to play with than they had before. They have less funding from the state of Connecticut and therefore they may carry a little bit less cash balances. Again, I think we are tremendously diversified throughout our municipal banking business that we had. This has been a strategic business that we built from the ground up over five years ago. And so weâre not out there bidding on deposits daily. Weâve got some very, very good core accounts. And when you talk about municipalities, itâs fire district, sewer district, boards of education, a variety of things. And so as Mike talked about the diversity within the commercial real estate portfolio, we have huge diversity in that municipal book, banking book too.
Damon DelMonte
Okay, great. Thank you. And then I guess just my last question probably for Greg as it relates to the margin. Can you give us an update on your outlook? I think most people are not expecting any type of rate increase in 2016 and I know from KBWâs perspective weâre not expecting it in 2017 as well. How are you guys looking at I guess future rate hikes and kind of how that impact the margin over the next few quarters?
Gregory White
So I just covered that our core margin went down a basis point first quarter. We donât give too much guidance here, as you know. We can only hope it only goes down a basis point â Iâm sorry, it went down a basis point Q1 to Q2. We would certainly like to see another basis point drop, meaning I think itâs going to be more than that. With that said, our net interest income on a core basis was flat Q1 to Q2. I do think we can continue to grow it as we go forward here. But certainly if rates stay here, margins across the industry are going to grind down.
Damon DelMonte
Okay, but at least with the pace of loan growth, it sounds like the spread income will be flat to maybe trending upward even though the actual margin level goes down.
Gregory White
Correct. Thatâs what we would expect.
Damon DelMonte
Okay, great. Thatâs all for now. Iâll hop out and let somebody else jump in. Thank you.
John Patrick
Thanks, Damon.
Operator
Our next question is from Laurie Hunsicker from Compass Point. Go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
Hi. Good morning.
John Patrick
Good morning, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker
I wondered if we could go back to Vernon. So, John, you mentioned weâre four weeks in and weâre already at breakeven. What is that number?
John Patrick
We have talked about â actually weâre more than breakeven. Our breakeven is between 20 million and 25 million in deposits.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay.
John Patrick
But weâre roughly double that.
Laurie Hunsicker
Youâre already at 50 million, okay, great. And then can you give us an update, the Massachusetts branches that are new in the east line?
John Patrick
Yes, weâre just shy of 100 million there.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay, and thatâs up from 80 million last quarter combined.
John Patrick
Right.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay.
John Patrick
But also considering the mix is changing too. So as we cross-sell into those customers, thereâs a nice mix thatâs changing there also. So there are up and deepening relationships.
Laurie Hunsicker
Sure. And then youâve got one more branch thatâs on the table for later this year, the Manchester?
John Patrick
Thatâs correct.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And thatâs still a third quarter event?
John Patrick
I would anticipate thatâs going to be a fourth quarter or it will be a fourth quarter event.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And are there any other branches that you currently have in the works?
John Patrick
Not right now.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay.
John Patrick
Weâre looking and evaluating and those types of things, but we think that these are â those were the ones that were important right now to grow where weâre growing. So we will be evaluating some others. But also, Laurie, as weâve discussed before, weâll see continued disruption in the marketplace and we want to see how that plays out a little bit.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay, great. And then your REO, I know thatâs normally a negligible number but I didnât see that in the press release. Do you have that number before close?
Gregory White
279,000 I think is in property.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And then also do you have the numbers for what loan service for others is? I think last quarter it was around 470 million.
John Patrick
Yes, 497 million.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay. And then whatâs the MSR associated with that?
Gregory White
Itâs about 85 basis points on that after the impairment.
Laurie Hunsicker
After the impairment. So that was down from 94 basis points last quarter.
Gregory White
Yes, thatâs in the ballpark but I know the current number â thatâs the impairment obviously that we took.
Laurie Hunsicker
Right, okay, great. And then, Mike, Iâll take you up on your commercial real estate breakdown by food group. Obviously, 18 debt service and 59% LTV is phenomenal but if you could just give it to us by group, that would be great and then Iâll leave it there? Thanks.
John Patrick
Let me call that servicing. Thatâs an allowance. So if rates rise, we get that back. Sorry Mike, go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
Right.
Michael Schweighoffer
Hi, Laurie.
Laurie Hunsicker
Hi, Mike.
Michael Schweighoffer
Retail weighted average LTV is 56.2, office 63.2, multifamily 57.2. Those are weighted average LTVs. Weighted average debt service; retail 191, office 155 and multifamily 152. The only thing I would point out there is we base all of those weighted average debt services on the contractual amortization, so itâs not what Iâll call a fictitious assumed amortization at 25 years. And Iâd be happy to share with you offline the average AMS [ph] that were done back there on the shorter side, because what weâre seeing in the marketplace is LTVs are getting pushed up, AMS are getting pushed out and the combination of the two sometimes makes us a little bit, Iâll call it queasy. So the average AMS that we have on the books are on the shorter end and the corresponding weighted average debt services are based off of those shorter AMS.
Laurie Hunsicker
Great.
Michael Schweighoffer
Does that help?
Laurie Hunsicker
Yes, thatâs helpful. Thanks, Mike. Iâll leave it there.
Operator
Our next question is from David Bishop from FIG Partners. Go ahead.
David Bishop
Good morning, gentlemen.
John Patrick
Good morning.
David Bishop
Iâm just curious, I know we had you on the road, we talked â there was a lot of focus on the commercial swap book and the appetite for future accommodation from the commercial side. Maybe just talk about or just discuss if your stance there or appetite for putting on additional swaps is pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter?
John Patrick
Yes, I think itâs consistent. It goes from deal to deal. So weâre out with a potential customer the other day and the nice thing is, itâs a strong borrower or someone thatâs been known to us for a long period of time. And we can give them a menu. And the menu is basically they could swap it if they feel like to do that, but also weâre in an interest rate position where we can give them a longer term fixed interest rate internally. That may make sense. It might give us a little bit more yield. And so two things, because of that interest rate position that weâre in and a really, really good credit, thatâs going to have significant deposits and a variety of other things. That gives us a little bit of a competitive advantage. So weâll work with the borrower to see what they want. Thereâs other â weâve seen in other competitive situations where certain companies pushing people towards swaps or not towards swaps. We try to look at it from a customer cash flow basis.
David Bishop
Got it. And then any update in terms of maybe the pricing within those swaps?
John Patrick
Yes, the margins â our credit spreads are running anywhere from 165 or pristine deals to 250, Iâll call it run of the mill deals. So on the spread side, itâs been pretty consistent.
David Bishop
Got it. And then I apologize, I jumped on late. Maybe and if this is repetition, I apologize, color in regards to the, I know the narrative referred had some reference. In regards to the change, the provision for all balance sheet commitments as a result of accounting estimates, walk through that real quick?
John Patrick
Cathy Burns will review that, our Chief Risk Officer.
Catherine M. Burns
This is Cathy Burns. Our external accountants ask us to enhance our audit documentation around a lot of processes. So we did that and the off-balance sheet reserve, as you know, relates to our un-advanced lines of credit. So we simply align our calculation there with our on-balance sheet reserve model and came up with that estimate change.
David Bishop
Got it, and I assume thatâs sort of a one-time catch-up change that wonât flow through continuously, correct?
Catherine M. Burns
Yes, we donât expect material changes in that line item going forward.
David Bishop
Got it. And then just holistically, I think you referred to it some of the disruption within the market there. Is that â had an impact I guess either in terms of inbound call volume either from affected commercial customers or residential customers or even conversely from personnel from some of these franchises to the market that was sort of the subject of pending acquisition or most recent acquisitions?
John Patrick
Yes, so I think itâs least amount of impact from a residential perspective, more impact from a commercial and consumer perspective. So when companies, and thereâs been a couple of them, I mean soon as yesterday I think in their press release today they announced kind of a restructuring around cost saves. They had a pretty significant layoff of some of their middle market lending personnel in Connecticut, central Connecticut thatâs going to have impact. And so obviously weâre going to be able to try to take advantage of that. Other companies have laid off customer-facing people in their branch networks. That has an impact on things. And so weâve been able to see some advantages of those changes. So primarily we see that on the commercial side and deposit side. I think weâre seeing a little bit more on the retail deposit side than we have historically too where people are looking for an alternative.
David Bishop
Got it. Thank you for the color.
John Patrick
Yes.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Matthew Breese from Piper Jaffray. Go ahead.
Matthew Breese
Good morning, everybody.
John Patrick
Hi, Matt.
Matthew Breese
I just wanted to stay on the new loan yield just for a second. To be clear on the credit spreads on the swaps CRE, 165 basis points, 250, thatâs on top of three-month LIBOR, correct?
Gregory White
Yes [ph].
Matthew Breese
Right. So is it fair to say that those are still meaningfully dilutive to overall loan yields?
Gregory White
Yes, they are for most part.
Matthew Breese
And is the majority what youâre putting on the swap CRE?
John Patrick
Not in the second quarter. I think what we did in the second quarter â I forget what we did in second quarter but the majority was not swap. In fact, C&I was much more variable and fixed term than anything but it was less in the second quarter.
Matthew Breese
Okay. And is that a function of your balance sheet positioning and being able to be a little bit more nimble on the margin, control the margin a bit more?
John Patrick
I would say yes. Mike and Greg communicate all the time relative to some of the more sizable deals in the marketplace that we see and positioning it from a pricing perspective in understanding what the full relationship will be. But itâs a lot of this inflexibility there. Obviously, we understand that longer for lower is there but also when we see the opportunity to bring on a larger relationship that has a lot of different mechanisms to it relative to cash management, future term financing and lending as well as being able to deepen the relationships with the employees of the organization, weâre going to pursue that.
Michael Schweighoffer
This is Mike. Good morning. Some more sophisticated, especially commercial real estate borrowers are seeking the swap pricing because of the pricing advantage that they will fetch in the marketplace. So itâs really customer acquisition, sometimes customer retention. But we offer a menu of items through them from a rate perspective because weâre in a â I donât know if itâs a unique position but a very good position from an interest rate risk standpoint so we can offer the menu. The swaps do compress margins somewhat but itâs a balancing act.
Matthew Breese
Right. What about the fixed rate commercial real estate? Yield curve did flatten over the quarter, it was a bit volatile. How did spreads hold up? And your Class A commercial real estate deal five years or seven years, what are the new loan yields on those?
John Patrick
The credit spreads, as I mentioned before, have remained consistent with the spot ones, so weâre really pricing off of the credit spread. If you look at the FHLB, which we pegged, they have come down. So as youâre looking at all-in yields anywhere from, Iâll call it â depending on where you are on the yield curve and the menu, high 3s to mid 4s. Right now itâs just a [indiscernible].
Matthew Breese
Okay. And then switching to the other side of the balance sheet, deposits came down this quarter. Some of that was seasonal it sounds like, but the loan to deposit ratio is still well above 100%. Can you talk a little bit about that and efforts to get that lower? And where would you like that ratio to be over the next 12 months?
John Patrick
Yes, weâve talked about this before and my message is really going to be consistent. I donât lose an ounce of sleep at night over our loan to deposit ratio. We have put â it is similar to CRE. We have put processes in place to monitor it. We have ongoing discussions with the regulators. We talk about the fact that we want to have that decline and I think itâs going to be up even in spite of the fact that we will grow our retail deposits faster than we will grow any of our lending this year from a balance perspective. Weâre focused on that. That will come down. That was pure seasonality. Quite frankly, I love the mix of where we are and I love the fact when I look at a brand new market that weâre in and not including any type of promotional accounts or anything like that. But when we opened 230 checking accounts in four weeks, pure checking accounts that quite frankly havenât really funded yet, thatâs really going to be the core of our business as we go forward and those are the things that weâre seeing in the other markets that weâre in. And weâre seeing nice growth in our existing markets. As I said, absent the municipal business, weâre up $82 million so far this year in deposits which exceeds the loan growth.
Matthew Breese
Right, okay. And then lastly just capital levels down to near 9% as measured by tangible common equity. How much more room can you â do you have to level the balance sheet? Where do you want to see that ratio go?
Gregory White
If you take a look now, I think over the last year on capital levels â the last quarter, it dipped a little bit but theyâve been relatively flat. So certainly the quality of our balance sheet could argue to drive it closer to 8 over time and I would think that would hold up with the regulators, but weâll be meeting with them actually next week to discuss capital levels as well. And thatâs our initiative having the regulators and itâs certainly a voluntary issue. So let me just â letâs see, so capital â Iâm looking at June 15, Tier 1 capital was 957, today itâs 955. So it did dip in between but obviously as we slow the balance sheet growth down, weâre certainly not overly concerned about the trends of capital right now. Earnings obviously has picked up as well. But given the quality of our balance sheet I believe we could certainly make an argument â our constraining ratio is still going to be our total risk-based capital, which is 1,263, so that could go down another 150 basis points we think the quality of our balance sheet.
John Patrick
Yes, and as Greg alluded to our discussions with regulators and so I donât want anyone to take away when we talk regulatory best practice in this company that where you ignore CRE concentrations or loans of value or things like that. But we have and weâre not meaning to be arrogant about it, but we like to say that we talked to analysts all the time, we talk to shareholders all the time, we talk to the community in general all the time and so one of my ideas was to proactively have a regulator day. And so we contact the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and the State Department of Banking and they have senior people and will come in and spend a couple of hours with them in our bank kind of talking about where we are, walking them through our base risk management platform and strategy and kind of taking them through how we see things. We give them an update on our strategic plan and our deposit growth and our loan growth, talk about compliance, information security and internal audit, all those juicy needy things that all you guys like. But we think that thatâs a good way to work with your regulators rather than having them come in and be surprised or not understanding where youâre going from a strategic direction. Our strategy and our strategic direction to Wall Street to investors has always pretty been very consistent based on what we said as our strategic plan. And so it just made sense to me to share that with regulators off the regulatory cycle. So thatâs kind of some of the reasons for my comments always around regulatory best practices and where we are on certain concentrations, whether it be CRE or loans and deposits. Again, itâs nice to be â we know more than anybody else. And we had the regulators in, itâs not a matter of mother may I, itâs about this is what weâre doing, this is what we see as best practices. We try to have the regulators help us provide any type of value add if thatâs necessary to run our company in a sound, safe manner as they see it but also to understand that we think that the less â weâre in the risk business, so if weâre taking prudent risk thatâs going to help our relative return for shareholders. Thatâs going to be able to help us build tangible book value over time and thatâs what weâve always been focused on.
Matthew Breese
Right, thatâs great. I appreciate the color. Thanks.
John Patrick
Yes.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. John Patrick for any closing remarks.
John Patrick
Great. Thank you again and we appreciate everybodyâs time and questions. And for investors and shareholders that are on the call, we appreciate your investment in our company. We do understand that we need to â and do manage our investment very, very prudently. And again, I think thatâs evidenced by our year-over-year growth in tangible book value of $0.94. So we appreciate your support and we look forward to seeing you in the future. Thank you for your interest.
