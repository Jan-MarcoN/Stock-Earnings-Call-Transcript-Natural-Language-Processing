Sanjay Jha
Thanks, Dean. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Motorola reported sales in the second quarter of $5.4 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $0.09 per share compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of last year. 
Each of our businesses delivered improved operating results year-over-year and sequentially. We generated $242 million of operating cash flow, completed $500 million debt tender offer and ended the quarter with total cash of $8.3 billion. 
In Mobile Devices, Smartphone unit shipments increased sequentially to 2.7 million units and a non-GAAP operating loss decline. DROID X, launched with Verizon in mid-July, is off to a great start and is exceeding our expectations.
In Home, sales were up sequentially and operating margin was higher. In EMS, sales grew 10% year-over-year driven by continued recovery in the Enterprise market and operating margin was higher. In Networks, second quarter sales and margins were up sequentially. We also announced that Nokia Siemens Networks plans to acquire the majority of the assets of our Networks business. Greg will comment further on the Networks transaction later in this call. 
Regarding separation, we continue to make significant progress in our plan to create two independent publicly traded companies. This month, we filed our initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. The filing contains information relating to the separation and the business strategies of Motorola Mobility, which will be comprised of Mobile Devices and Home. Upon separation, Enterprise Mobility Solutions and the iDEN Infrastructure business will comprise the company to be led by Greg Brown and will be called Motorola Solutions. Our target for the separation remains the first quarter of 2011. 
I'll turn the call over now to Ed to provide additional details on Motorola's overall financial results for the quarter. I'll than come back to review Motorola Mobility, and then Greg will cover Motorola Solutions. Ed?
Edward Fitzpatrick
Thanks, Sanjay. Motorola sales were $5.4 billion in the second quarter, On a GAAP basis, second quarter earnings were $0.07 per share compared to $0.01 per share a year ago. As Sanjay stated, non-GAAP earnings, which exclude highlighted items, stock compensation and intangible amortization, were $0.09 per share. This compares to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2009. Highlighted items totaled net income of $0.02 per share. This includes income related to a legal settlement, tax recovery and the sale of certain businesses and investments, partially offset by expenses associated with separation and reorganization costs.
Stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses were $0.04 per share, consistent with prior quarters. Further details on non-GAAP earnings are included as part of today's press release. All remaining financial references will exclude highlighted items, stock compensation and intangible amortization. 
Gross margins in the quarter increased to 37.3% from 31.1% in the second quarter of 2009. The increase was due to the improvements in all of the businesses with the most significant improvement coming in Mobile Devices. Operating expenses in the quarter were up 4% year-over-year. The increase primarily relates to investments in sales and marketing as well as advertising and promotional expenses in support of key products across all of our businesses. With the updated geographical mix of income that we anticipate for this year, we now expect a full year tax rate of 36% to 37%, up from our previous estimate of 34% to 35%. As a result, the ongoing tax rate in the quarter was 40%. While our income statement tax rate will be higher than previously anticipated, we do not expect any meaningful change in cash taxes paid this year.
Moving now to the balance sheet. In the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $242 million. This includes a legal settlement in relation to a patent infringement litigation which resulted in a one-time cash inflow of $175 million. Inventory increased by $48 million sequentially. However, inventory turns improved to 11 compared to 10 turns in the first quarter and nine turns in the second quarter of last year. Accounts receivable also increased in the quarter, reflecting the sequential sales growth, less favorable linearity and a lower level of cash inflow from sales of receivables. As a result, days sales outstanding were 61 days, up from 57 days in the first quarter. We do expect to drive the DSOs below the current level during the second half. 
During the quarter, we completed a $500 million debt tender offer in closing the sale of our Israel-based Wireless Network Operator business. Total cash at the end of the quarter was $8.3 billion compared to $8.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the first quarter and $2.5 billion in the second quarter of 2009.
Turning now to our outlook. We expect third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. This guidance includes the Networks business and excludes $0.04 per share related to stock compensation and intangible amortization expenses as well as items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases. 
With that, I'll pass the call to Sanjay to discuss Motorola Mobility.
Sanjay Jha
Thanks, Ed. Mobile Devices second quarter sales were over $1.7 billion on total shipment of 8.3 million units, including 2.7 million Smartphones. Overall, ASP increased to approximately $207 from $192 in the first quarter due to a more favorable product mix.
We now have over 300 Smartphone launches with carriers, distributors and retailers in 85 countries. While we continue to build momentum in U.S., our sales outside North America accounted for 34% of our total sales. The operating loss in the quarter declined to $109 million compared to a loss of $148 million in the first quarter on a sequential basis. The loss declined due to a higher Smartphone unit volume and improved overall gross margin percentage, offset partially by slightly higher operating expenses. 
During the quarter, we made four additions to our Smartphone portfolio: The i1, the world's first push-to-talk Android-powered Smartphone, began shipping to Sprint in May. The DROID X, with its rich mobile Internet experience and enhanced Enterprise capabilities is getting a great reception from consumers.
Two devices with the most social stay-connected focus included the FLIPOUT, which features a compact pivoting design and enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, will ship to Latin America, Europe and U.S. this quarter. And CHARM, also with enhanced MOTOBLUR functionality, will ship to T-Mobile. With our enhancements to MOTOBLUR, consumers will have increased control over their mobile experience. Enhancements include customizable content filters, the ability to move and re-size widgets and new ways to manage and improve battery life and data usage. MOTOBLUR is a clear satisfier for consumers and we expect it to create consumer stickiness and improve long-term repurchase intent for our devices.
In China, our second largest Smartphone market, sales grew nearly 9% sequentially. With seven Smartphones now in the market, sales were solid for all three major carriers with our top seller being the XT800 for China Telecom. As we expand our portfolio further in the second half, we will continue to focus on differentiating ourselves in a number of ways. These include a broad-based portfolio of Smartphones with tightly integrated consumer experiences, focused R&D investment, continued supply chain and manufacturing execution, uncompromising quality in hardware and RF design and a strong brand. 
From a brand perspective, the strength of our Smartphone portfolio is improving brand awareness, purchase intent and relevancy in key markets. With an expanding portfolio of leadership products, we can leverage a strengthening brand to grow in North America, China and Latin America. Our focus will expand to include more emphasis on Europe and other strategic markets next year.
With regards to the portfolio, we now expect to launch more than 20 Smartphones this year. Regarding our Smartphone shipment guidance, I remain confident in the range of 12 million to 14 million units shipped this year. In mid- to high-tier feature phones, as we anticipated, volume declined in the second quarter. Through the second half, we expect feature phone unit volume to remain relatively stable. In voice-centric devices, we expect to build brand awareness, meet retail channel requirements and yield modest financial returns. 
Looking ahead, on a sequential basis, we expect third quarter Smartphone unit volume, overall unit volume and total sales to be higher. And for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2006, Mobile Devices will grow its top line on a year-over-year basis. With a sequentially higher unit volume and improved mix, we expect a further reduction in the operating loss. And in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect to be profitable, driven by further increases in Smartphone volumes.
Turning now to the results for Home in second quarter. Home sales were $886 million, up 6% sequentially. Sales of customer premise equipment were up slightly and reflected a higher demand for HD set-tops compared to the first quarter. Competitiveness amongst our customer base, growing HD content and channel offering and on-demand services are all contributing to network expansion. As a result, sales of video and access infrastructure were up sequentially, up double digits year-over-year and accounted for over 25% of total Home sales. Sales outside North America were up slightly year-over-year and sequentially and accounted for approximately 30% of total sales. Operating margin increased to 6.4% from 4.8% in the second quarter of last year. The improvement was driven by favorable product mix and lower operating costs.
In Home, we focused on extending our video leadership position capabilities and portfolio of solutions to support our customers' needs to deliver content and advanced services in a more personalized fashion for consumers. This includes whole-home network solutions, 3D TV, interactive services and conversion experiences, such as uniform delivery of content to a multi-screen environment. In the quarter, we introduced an advanced HD IPTV set-top box with KDDI in Japan, which addresses the trend towards fixed-mobile convergence. It supports ultra high-speed broadband connections and personalized media experiences, including set-top-to-mobile device content transfer.
We announced software enhancements for our DCX line of set-tops, which provide consumers with a simplified 3D viewing experience in the home. For operators, it provides a solution to deploy 3D content using existing video delivery infrastructure. We expanded our portfolio with an all-digital set-top that can serve as a multimedia IP hub for whole-home networks, giving consumers more control and access to content anywhere in the home.
Finally, we announced Medios, a suite of software solutions that evolves with current network element to allow operators to receive, store and distribute content across a multiple-screen environment. It also provides merchandising tool and security that enable advanced, on-demand services and commerce.
Turning now to outlook. In Home, we now expect sales for the full year to decline by approximately 7%, which is at the top end of the range we've previously provided. Operating margin is expected to increase, driven by a favorable product mix and improvement in the cost structure. For the third quarter, we expect Home sales to be comparable with higher operating margin as compared to the second quarter. 
In closing, the filing of our initial Registration Statement with the SEC earlier this month was a milestone event, as we continue on a path to create a new, independent public company. 
The convergence of Wireless, Media and Internet and Computing is creating a digital lifestyle for consumers globally. Consumers increasingly want to communicate, manage content and experience entertainment and the Internet in a way that's more personal, intuitive and contextual. And they want to do so from any location and on any screen. Motorola Mobility's core strength in synergies and technology, design and customer relationships, together with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio and a re-energized brand, puts us in a unique position to address this growing marketplace. 
With that, I'll pass the call over to Greg to discuss Motorola Solutions. Greg?
Gregory Brown
Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning. Last week, we announced an agreement with Nokia Siemens Networks to purchase the majority of our Wireless Network assets, including CDMA, GSM, WiMAX and LTE. NSN is the right partner for our Network's customers and our employees, given their position in the industry and their commitment to long-term growth.
We will receive $1.35 billion in value from the transaction, which includes $1.2 billion from NSN and $150 million for retained accounts receivable. We also retain our profitable iDEN business, substantially all of the Wireless Network's patents and also a portfolio of long-term receivables. We're proud of the track record and accomplishments delivered by the business and its employees. This is particularly true over the last few years amidst a very challenging competitive and economic environment. With the transition to Nokia Siemens Networks, our employees will be able to continue to deliver innovative solutions and serve our customers around the world. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year. Over the next several months, we'll work with NSN on a smooth transition and continue to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
Turning now to results for the quarter. Both Enterprise Mobility Solutions and Networks delivered a very strong financial and operational performance. In EMS, second quarter sales were $1.9 billion, up 10% compared to the year-ago quarter. In our Enterprise market, recovery continues, evidenced by double-digit sales growth in all four geographic regions. Government sales were also up over last year with growth largely coming from the Americas.
Operating margin increased to 15.8% from 13.4% in the second quarter of last year. The increase was due primarily to higher sales and a more favorable product mix. Second quarter sales in North America grew 14% year-over-year. Growth was driven by both Public Safety and Enterprise markets. Notable new subscriber wins included awards in California, New York and Canada. Major P25 system wins included counties in New York, Washington, Maryland and Georgia, two of which displaced incumbent suppliers. 
In Enterprise, sales were strong in all product categories. In RFID Solutions, we're beginning to see stronger interest levels driven by inventory control benefits and the opportunity for retailers to increase sales per customer. In this regard, our mobile RFID platform was recently deployed by Wal-Mart U.S. to support their apparel tracking program. Over time, we expect Wal-Mart U.S. and other retailers to expand their use of RFID Solutions across a wide variety of product categories.
In EMEA, total sales were up 1% in the quarter amid continuing economic and fiscal challenges. Particularly in Europe, we continue to see good customer engagement but lower top line growth compared to other regions. The growth that we are experiencing is being driven by Enterprise markets growing at double digit rates. Part of this growth is being driven by a very successful reception to our personal shopping systems, which improve the convenience of in-store shopping experience. With demonstrated benefits such as improved service levels and enhanced customer loyalty, demand by retailers has been strong, including recent sales to Carrefour, ECA and TESSCO. 
In Asia, sales in the quarter were up 2% compared to a year ago, normalizing for a major system implementation in Malaysia last year. Asia sales were up 18% over last year. Enterprise markets continue to perform very well, and major new orders included Public Safety and transportation wins in China and in India.
From an R&D perspective, we continue to invest in this business during the tough economic climate of 2008 and 2009. As a result, we are well positioned for emerging growth opportunities in both Enterprise and Public Safety markets. This past quarter in the Enterprise market, we announced the smallest and lightest Enterprise Digital Assistant in our Mobile Computing platform. The ES400 features a customizable user interface, integrated voice and data capabilities, as well as mobile computing and scanning functionality. This device is targeted at improving the productivity and efficiency of mobile workforces and offers Enterprise-class security for business-critical applications and information. We also introduced the industry's first TETRA wideband data-capable mobile radio and the world's smallest single-unit data-capable base station, offering a cost-effective solution for expanding coverage.
Finally, we recently outlined our strategy for delivering next-generation, advanced communication solutions for Public Safety. Our solutions address the growing need to supplement voice with rich data, imaging and video communications enabled by broadband networks. By connecting multiple agencies and jurisdictions with mission-critical voice and LTE networks, we can enhance situational awareness, improve productivity and heighten preparedness for emergency situations. 
Today, we are announcing that we were awarded the first phase of a 700-megahertz LTE network for Public Safety across multiple counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. This agreement represents a first step in deploying a unified state-of-the-art, private, mission-critical broadband multimedia network. By combining a Public Safety-hardened LTE network with the existing voice and data networks, the San Francisco Bay Area has the opportunity to equip their first responders with the advanced communications tools that they need to better protect themselves and their communities. This system is the first of its kind and further demonstrates Motorola's leadership and commitment to delivering innovative, next-generation Public Safety solutions.
Looking ahead for the third quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with higher operating margin. We still continue to expect full year sales growth in the mid-single digits, with slightly improved operating margin for the full year compared to 2009.
Turning now to Networks. Sales were $967 million, down slightly from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter, driven by strong CDMA sales in North America. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 14.9% in the year-ago quarter. As was the case in the first quarter, the margin level was driven primarily by a favorable mix. 
In LTE, we continue to make progress in our KDDI implementation. In China, we successfully completed Phase I field trials of our TD-LTE solution. We are now moving forward with Phase II of that trial. We also continue to showcase our LTE capabilities in partnership with China Mobile at the Shanghai World Expo. 
Regarding out outlook following a very strong first half in CDMA, we do expect to gradually return to a more normalized sales mix and operating margin level by the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, on a sequential basis, we expect sales to be comparable with lower operating margin. For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 10% compared to 2009 with operating margin now expected to be in the range for the full year of 13% to 14%.
In closing, all of Motorola's businesses performed well in the quarter, delivering improved financial results year-over-year. In the first half, we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share compared to breakeven on a per-share basis in the first half of last year. And net cash is up $2.4 billion from the second quarter of 2009. As we head into the third quarter, we expect to deliver higher earnings, generate positive operating cash flow and, for the first time in 3Â½ years, we expect Motorola's quarterly sales to grow year-over-year. 
In the coming months, we will also continue to make progress on separation and creating two companies poised for long-term success. Sanjay talked about Motorola Mobility being uniquely positioned for converging consumer demands. For Motorola Solutions, with a sharpened strategic focus, we are solidly positioned for profitable growth. We plan to leverage our market leadership in Public Safety, Mobile Computing, Data Capture and Wireless LAN to provide next-generation solutions for our Government, Public Safety and Enterprise customers around the world. 
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dean to start the Q&A.
Dean Lindroth
Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, we'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, you can now provide our callers with instructions on how to ask a question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.
Sanjay, with regards to your guidance, I must say I'm somewhat disappointed on your Smartphone guidance. It's two quarters in a row now where you, "come ahead of your expectations," yet you don't seem to feel enough confidence to raise the high end of your guidance on Smartphones. So maybe you can kind of walk us through the puts and takes and what are you seeing in the business that makes you still remain very conservative on that front. And second, with regards to the operating margin improvement, what needs to happen -- is profitability in the third quarter even a possibility? Or you think it's a remote possibility?
Sanjay Jha
I guess to the substance of the question, I certainly have greater confidence now in the range. I would say, absent supply-chain constraints, I would see a modest increase in shipments beyond what I've guided. But as you know, there are some constraints in the industry today. I would also say that I believe that we have momentum going into the third and fourth quarter, and we have greater visibility of our customer demand and market acceptance of our products. Nonetheless, we feel that the range is an appropriate range for the moment. In terms of operating margin, we have guided you to a profitability in fourth quarter. And we remain confident that we will be able to achieve that. In the third quarter, we have guided you to sequential improvement in operating profit. And we, again, remain confident in that range, Ittai.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets Corporation
Sanjay, tactically, are there more proactive things you can do to drive consumer preference towards Motorola versus the 30 other Android devices out there without increasing your OpEx? How can you ensure that Motorola is and will remain Verizon's first choice, for example? Can you replicate this model with another carrier? And also do you feel Android and DROID X, in particular, is more than enough for Verizon to no longer consider an iPhone for their network?
Sanjay Jha
Well, tactically, if I look at what is driving our success in the marketplace, I think it's definitely the quality of our design and the quality of our execution in the Android space. Remember that DROID X is not a Google-experienced device, it's a Motorola-experienced device, and we have spent a lot of time integrating a lot of experiences, which are unique to Motorola. MOTOBLUR is one. Certainly, the user interface is meaningfully improved also from what we delivered in our first MOTOBLUR experience. So I think that the first part of it is of our own execution of our product. We believe that we have delivered a very good quality product. And the short period that, that product has been in the market, we've seen very good quality and the return rate is very good also. I think we need to get associates in each of the retail channels to view Motorola DROID as a safe device that they can recommend to their customers. We achieved that with DROID, and we believe we are well on the way of achieving that with the DROID X. I would say that improvement in our brand name and brand positioning is very important to us. Our relationship with our carriers is very important to us. And I really think the expansion of our footprint outside of United States and with other carriers is also going to be important to us. In terms of iPhone, I really don't know the dynamics around that discussion with various different carriers in the United States. I can tell you that I think DROID is a meaningful economic proposition for Verizon. My perspective is that as long as we continue to execute the way we're doing it, Verizon will continue to invest in both us as well as DROID as a brand name.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG
Sanjay, you talked briefly about China. Can you kind of give us a little more granularity in what you expect out of that market sequentially? What number of brands? Or number of different phones you expect to have in that market for this year? What do you think it'll be as a percent of your revenue for the year? And then on MOTOBLUR, it's obviously very important to you. But it's still not a category that we see a lot of advertising on or see a lot of promotion of. What are your plans for MOTOBLUR through the end of the year?
Sanjay Jha
Brian, outside of U.S., about 35% of all of our revenue is outside of U.S., and China accounts for -- China and Latin America are the two largest contributors to that 35% of our total revenue. As I said earlier, we have seven products in the market and we'll continue to roll out new products in China and other regions. In China, our portfolio divides into two categories: Specific devices just for China, for instance, our XT800 is a dual-standby device dedicated to China Telecom; and the other devices are devices like BACKFLIP, DEXT and Milestone, which we have rolled out across all international regions. So you will see us deliver TD-SCDMA dedicated devices to China Mobile, some dedicated devices to China Telecom. And for China Unicom, we tend to use devices which are more international. As I look forward to China, both this year and going forward, I guess, in next year, we continue to see expansion in our revenue and gross margin from China. It's a place where we will invest more in building our brand. And we see great opportunity in China, Brian.
Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG
And MOTOBLUR?
Sanjay Jha
With MOTOBLUR, we have found that being able to convey the value proposition around MOTOBLUR is not an easy thing to do in a 30-second ad spot. We have decided that we will focus on the value proposition of products and not MOTOBLUR as a brand name in its own right. And MOTOBLUR continues to be important, and I think you will see increased functionality in MOTOBLUR. This notion of push Internet is going to be very important to us. But as a brand name which we make matter in front of consumers, as a brand name, I don't think that's going to be our focus going forward. But we see the experiences that we deliver as being relevant in differentiating us.
Operator
And our next question comes from Mark McKechnie with Gleacher & Co.
Mark McKechnie - Gleacher & Company, Inc.
Sanjay, I wanted to ask about, you mentioned some supply constraints that's limiting the upside above the 14 million level. Can you talk a little bit about the supply-demand dynamics of that DROID X launch? And how Verizon is seeing the overall launch?
Sanjay Jha
Mark, certainly DROID X has exceeded our expectations. At appropriate time, Verizon will comment on their sales numbers. But we believe that we will catch up with demand some time through the course of this quarter. We find multiple components in the industry being constrained. I think the investment largely in semiconductor space of various different kinds over the last 2Â½ years has been below par. And I believe that the industry now is trying to compensate for that, and there is some greater investment in the semiconductor space. But at the moment, I would say that, that is probably our largest constraint. We are working very closely with our partners. As some of you know, I was in that space and I have a very good relationship in that space. And I expect that we will overcome some of those issues as we progress through the year. In terms of Verizon's attitude towards DROID X, our shipments are still relatively healthy. And it's just that demand is outstripping those supplies. So Verizon's been very understanding of our position.
Operator
Your next question comes from Phil Cusick with Macquarie.
Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research
Greg, can you talk about -- it seems like the constant conversation is what's the visibility on Government and their continued ability to spend as municipalities come under pressure. And it just seems like you're not seeing any issues. Can you talk about that a little bit? And then what's the conversation like with Enterprise these days? Are they really looking to ramp up spending? It sounds like things are going real well. But is there sort of overall spending coming up? Or is just a shift in their spend toward you?
Gregory Brown
So I think that the 10% revenue growth for EMS in Q2 was really, really strong. And just to clarify, on the full year, we left guidance for the full year still at mid-single digits. I do want to point out that at the end of May, we sold MIRS, which was the Israeli-based iDEN wireless operator network. So when you normalize for MIRS coming out for the seven months left in 2010, the growth rate for EMS on a normalized basis is solidly in the 5% to 8% sales growth range with operating margin for the full year approximately in the 16% to 17% range. That said, Phil, you're right, Government, the Public Safety has been pretty resilient. It was generally flattish in Europe and Asia, up in the Americas. And I think it's a reflection of, despite the stress and duress of state budgets, the prioritization and the importance of mission-critical infrastructure and upgrading that technology to improve interoperability. We always watch it every quarter. And so far, it has performed quite well for the first half of 2010. In terms of the conversation with Enterprise, it's excellent. The engagements are up, the funnel is up. We've grown in double digits on the Enterprise side in Q2. And I think it's a reflection of overall spending coming up and a prioritization and kind of a pickup, if you will, Phil, of investment that was suspended for the previous three, four, five quarters given the economic downturn. And with a positive ROI and fairly rapid payback around inventory management, in-store shopping and so on, it's picking up nicely.
Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research
Can you talk a little more about this Public Safety network in California? And especially as you sell the Networks business, how did your ability to bid on those going forward change?
Gregory Brown
I think selling the Networks business doesn't affect our Public Safety LTE position at all. Remember, the network that we are announcing today with San Francisco is a private Public Safety network. So it's private broadband LTE in the 700-megahertz band that we're building out for Phase I. It will cover multiple counties and 10 sites initially. Over time, you will see these hardened LTE Public Safety systems be private and public. Our view is, and we're investing now and have been last year as well, we are delivering a private broadband LTE experience that will have roaming capabilities in rural areas and interoperability with the wireless operator in those respective regions. But in terms of LTE expertise and the investment in R&D we're making in LTE in the private broadband side, selling Networks to Nokia Siemens does not affect that. We're still full steam ahead.
Operator
The next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
A question for Ed to start with. Can you update us on your cash flow guidance for the full year? I think you had said previously it was going to be flat on a gross level and now you're giving us, helpfully, net cash flow figures. But can you balance for us the upcoming debt repayment you have in November? The working capital reduction, reduction in receivables that you mentioned? And also ongoing cash flow from operations? And also just to follow on with Greg, can you outline a little bit the two to three opportunities you're going to see for EMS post-separation, given that you already have a number one share globally in Public Safety? And it's clear we're in an Enterprise-spending cycle right now, but maybe that would be somewhat of a risky assumption to assume it continues all for 2011 and 2012. So where would Enterprise Mobility become a growth business in 2011 and beyond?
Edward Fitzpatrick
Okay, I'll start on the cash- and balance-sheet-related items. So the cash balance today is $8.3 billion. As you know, we have an approximately $500 million debt payment due in the fourth quarter. Our goal will be to offset as much as we can that debt payment. I would suspect our cash balance to be down slightly because of the $500 million payment. But we'll do our best to offset that. The only way we get there is by continuing to improve the working capital metrics. We've done a decent job. We slipped a little bit this quarter with receivables, as I mentioned. But we do expect to improve on that. But the working capital balances will grow, as I've mentioned on previous calls. It's just we've got to continue to improve the metrics. As sales grow throughout the third and fourth quarter, working capital will grow, but we'll try to offset that as best we can. So I hope that gives you a bit of color on where we expect to end the year. Right now, I would outlook slightly down because of the debt payment. But we'll try to offset that as much as we possibly can. On the cash from ops, I think it flows. I think you can back into it. We talked about CapEx being in the 1%, 1Â½% to as high as 2% range, so you could kind of back into the operating cash flow for the rest of the year.
Gregory Brown
Richard, in terms of some of the drivers post-separation for Enterprise Mobility, I guess, first and foremost, is we expect to see continued solid growth in the core for Public Safety as there's more than enough room to grow vis-Ã -vis technology refresh, emphasis on statewide systems here in the states, border control, anti-terrorism efforts and then internationally with the emphasis on countrywide systems. So I think the core continues to grow, and we'll continue to invest in the upgrade and technology refresh cycle. The second is 60% of the businesses is in North America, 40% is in international. I think international represents a significant growth opportunity as a category where we can get increased penetration and, over time, grow that composition from an international expansion perspective. Third would be Enterprise. And you're right, it's a bit cyclical. But we are coming out of a trough cycle and with investment and enhancement in Wireless LAN, but specifically Wireless LAN security in our Symbol 802.11 technologies; in RFID, I think which was overhyped three or four years ago and is now beginning to be more front and center. Reference Wal-Mart U.S. and the RFID apparel tracking system, which, at the moment, is only encompassing jeans, and we'll look for multiple products, multiple retailers. And the third opportunity for growth is vertical expansion. We're particularly strong, obviously, in Government and Public Safety, in transportation, in logistics and retail. But there's a whole adjacency around manufacturing, education, healthcare and other verticals where we can repurpose product and strike partnerships for vertical expansion with existing product. And then lastly, the San Francisco example this morning, I think next-generation Public Safety opportunities, this is seismic. This is a fundamental, structural change to this business that will move us from narrowband push-to-talk voice and enable us to be a full suite provider of narrowband and broadband with Motorola's worldwide-recognized brand in Public Safety. So the whole notion of building out a next-generation broadband LTE network for Public Safety is pretty substantial and will take several years. And lastly, just one more, I do think there's an opportunity on the services side and for us to evaluate services that are in markets that are logical for us to extend to, whether it be Hosted Applications, Public Safety, National Security, Enterprise, Hosted Services, that's another category that I think could be meaningful for us to grow.
Richard Kramer - Arete Research
And given all that, do you think this is, when you look out 2011 and beyond, could this be a double-digit growth business because in the last few years, it's obviously struggled both with Enterprise and Government spending?
Gregory Brown
Well, I think, historically, Richard, the business has always been solid and in the 5% to 8% revenue growth. The exception, of course, was last year when the macroeconomics turned downward. I'll refrain from 2011 guidance. But I think the point I'm trying to make is I think we're extremely well positioned as a market leader. But the markets are sizable enough, from an addressability standpoint, to give us ample opportunity to grow for a long period of time. And we'll update you as we get closer to separation on what 2011 looks like.

Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley
Sanjay, on the unit shipments that you did this quarter on Smartphones, did you notice any benefit from the lack of supply that HTC or just probably direct competitor at Verizon had during the quarter? And when you shipped 2.6 million units, you had guided up last quarter. Is that sort of where you had in mind, the 2.6 million? Or did you have a lower number in mind and you actually saw some benefit from HTC to get you there? What I'm trying to understand is how much maybe you got from that break by being the only supplier at Verizon versus you had mentioned some supply constraints, and whether that kind of cut off what you had been anticipating. And then in your guidance, if you look at the same thing going forward, you're now guiding up. You'd guided up last quarter. The last couple quarters, we ended up with plus-300,000 in Q1, plus-400,000 this quarter. When you guide up, how should we look at guiding up? You're clearly in a lot more geographies now, a lot more SKU numbers out there right now. But I would have imagined that you may have been able to sell more given the circumstances last quarter. So just trying to understand, when you say up this quarter, are we looking at up a million? Or are we looking at half a million? How we should look at that opportunity? Greg, you talked a little bit about FID, but it seems that it's -- like you said something that may be kind of coming into its own now after being a little bit overhyped several years ago. Do you see that as being one of your large growth drivers going forward? And in terms of margins, and you look at your different businesses that you're in, and specifically, I'm looking away from Public Safety; more on the Wireless Enterprise side. How do your margins change as RFID gets larger? And can you give us a sense as to where you think RFID is in its life cycle right now?
Sanjay Jha
This is a Sanjay. Just to clarify one thing, I think you said that our shipment this quarter was 2.6 million. So I just wanted to be clear, it was 2.7 million. And our previous quarter was 2.3 million. So the increase, as you said, was 400,000 units this year. Going forward, I anticipate the increase to be greater than that amount. So to go back to your first question of did we see in the second quarter our shipment go up because there was shortage of Incredible or HTC components of phones at Verizon, I don't know with precision the answer to that. I don't think it had as large an impact as some may believe. I don't think it had as large an impact as you may think. I think going forward, we, again, just to go back to the guidance, we feel very confident in the 12 million to 14 million range and very confident about profitability in fourth quarter. Visibility is definitely better. There are some supply issues and there's some concern around what happens to the economy in fourth quarter and those issues certainly make us careful about our guidance.
Gregory Brown
Ehud, in terms of RFID, it's not going to be material in 2010. I think in terms of where we're at in the game, I think we're in the first or second inning in terms of RFID deployment in Enterprise systems. So it's very early. The thing also to remember is that RFID, as we sell it, will be bundled. So it's going to be bundled into Mobile Computing capabilities. It's going to be bundled into fixed readers within a store. So I wouldn't necessarily be able to extract or call out the technology in and of itself. Do I think it's a primary area for growth over the next several years? I do. It's too early to describe the addressable market and how meaningful. But without a doubt, like Wal-Mart U.S. and other retailers, we have engagements and we're selling opportunities that were nowhere on the radar screen 18 months ago. I think it's going to be significantly important, and we'll quantify it as time moves on over the next several quarters.
Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Sanjay, can you just clarify on the feature phones? Are we at breakeven yet?
Sanjay Jha
Yes, we are. Remember that we have -- in that category, we include both iDEN and some ruggedized devices that we deliver in that category. Ehud, if you remember, I've broken my shipments into three categories: Smartphones, feature phones and voice-centric phones. And on feature phones, we're definitely profitable.

The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc
A quick clarification: Sanjay, you'd mentioned that you expect to launch more than 20 Smartphones this year. Looking back, at least in January, I noticed you said that you plan to launch at least 20 Smartphone devices. I'm just wondering, your voice seems to imply that now you're expecting bigger than plan. But looking at the transcripts and stuff, I'm just wondering if it's a play on words or really is something going better than expected than say six months ago on your number of launches? And then more importantly, strategically, when you look at the Android market, Sanjay, and you see companies such as HTC and some of the others with operating profits between 10% and 15%, do you think that's where the market and Motorola will be able to go to? Or as you progress with time in the competitiveness of the market, does it get lower? I'm just trying to view strategically where you're kind of aiming for, for the profitability and you see the Android and your efforts going?
Sanjay Jha
So Jim, it wasn't a word on play. That was a slightly different guidance than the guidance that I had provided. I had said at least 20. And today I said more than 20. I think at the start of the year, I was a little more conservative about our execution risks and a few other things that we have to take into account. I'm more certain about our execution and I do believe that we will deliver actually meaningfully more than 20 products. That's why I wanted to update the guidance to you. The second part of the question around -- there are two parts to the answer. One is what will be the industry-wide operating margin for a very competitive Smartphone marketplace, one. And secondly, will we converge towards that operating profit or not? My expectation is that the operating profit in the business will be in the industry-wide, it will be high single digit to low double digits. And I anticipate, over a period of time, there's no reason why our profitability will not reflect industry-wide profitability, Jim. I think that for us, it's an issue of scale and making sure that we get leverage from our operating expenses. And I think over a period of time, I anticipate we will get there.

Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Just a quick follow-up for both Sanjay and Greg. Sanjay, can you just comment on how much visibility you have at this point into the carrier promotions into the holidays? And in particular, do you feel like you'd be getting similar positioning in terms of some of the HERO campaigns at Verizon as what you've been enjoying, considering some of the potentially new entrants there in the Android side with LG or Samsung and also potentially the iPhone? And then for Greg, you mentioned the seismic opportunities with next-generation Public Safety as it moves to LTE. How do you think that move to LTE is going to affect the market structure in terms of competition and margins, in particular, given it's an open standard? In other words, do you think that will invite some new competitors there that you didn't have before?
Sanjay Jha
Simona, I'll get started with the first part of your question. I think the fourth quarter this year, clearly, in Smartphone, will be very, very competitive. You've already seen RIM announce that they will have OS 6 devices in the marketplace. I anticipate that there's some good probability of Windows Phone 7 Devices to be in the marketplace. And of course, the Android marketplace itself is highly competitive. But my visibility for fourth quarter is beginning to be better. I think that we will have meaningful products in the marketplace. And as I say, if you look at the number of launches we've already had, we have a pretty large number of launches in the second half of this year. In terms of carrier promotion, I think we're well-placed. I can't say with certainty exactly how many dollars. But I think we're well placed with multiple carriers to drive sales in fourth quarter, Simona.
Gregory Brown
Simona, in terms of Public Safety, I think the opportunity will be several years to play out. I think we're very well positioned. The standard for narrowband is P25. And LTE, per your point, is an open standard as well defining data broadband. So I think we're very well-positioned. It absolutely will be competitive. The narrowband market on P25 is competitive today. Of course, TETRA is as well. So LTE will be competitive in Public Safety. But with our brand, our installed base, the domain expertise, the customization and our R&D investment, which remains consistent and quite solid, I think we're as well positioned or better positioned than anybody to pursue that.

Our next question comes from Travis McCourt with Morgan Keegan.
Tavis McCourt - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.
Sanjay, did any DROID X initial shipments made it into Q2? Or is the DROID X completely a Q3 event? And also, your international shipments, I think, for Q1 were also about 35% of sales. I realize you're trying to run to catch up with Verizon here. But at what point do you think we should expect international mix to get a little bigger? Would that be a prospect in the back half of this year or more of a 2011 event? And then Greg, if you can give us an update on the backlog in the Government business. I remember last year there was one quarter you said the backlog had been down. Has that stabilized and started to grow again yet? Or is that still somewhat challenged?
Sanjay Jha
So, Travis, to your first question, was there any DROID X shipment in this quarter, yes, there was, a pretty modest amount. The vast majority of shipment will obviously happen in third quarter with the launch being on July 15. There was a very modest amount of shipment which started in the month of June. And we did recognize some of that revenue and gross margin in this quarter. The second part of your question was are we looking to expand percentage of our revenue coming from outside; outside of U.S. that is. As I mentioned, about 35% of our revenue is from outside of U.S. And as I look to the second half of this year, I think that, that ratio would probably hold. And in 2011, I actually think that there'll be a meaningful change. But in 2010, I expect that, that ratio would be in the ballpark of where we are today.
Gregory Brown
And, Travis, in terms of backlog, it varies by geography. But overall, I would say it's relatively stable.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Hoffman with Cowen.
Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC
First, what IP around LTE did EMS maintain or will it maintain post the divestiture of the Networks business? And second, you kind of addressed this, but should we think of LTE as really the foundation of EMS private networks moving forward? Or will it just be more of a side product line?
Gregory Brown
So Sanjay and I have worked very closely over the last several quarters to ensure that we are well positioned. Both businesses are very well positioned from an intellectual property standpoint. And I emphasize that significantly; we've stayed very linked at the hip in that regard. And as you saw, when we sold the Networks business to Nokia Siemens, we, Motorola, retained substantially all of the Wireless Networking patents. I do think EMS is well positioned from an LTE intellectual property standpoint. Of course, Sanjay's business will be as well, post-separation. In terms of private broadband LTE, I don't want to get out in front of my headlights, but it is a very big opportunity. It's also an opportunity, though, that's going to take a long time and several years to build out. Recognize that today, the LTE standard is for broadband data. It does not have voice in the standard. All of our mission-critical data systems, P25, are voice-oriented with narrowband data. So I would expect the existing systems and architecture infrastructure to be predominant for the next few years. Over time, private broadband LTE gets more significant. But I view them as coexisting and I view a public-private interoperable set of networks several years down the road.
Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC
Great. And would you say that there's a major difference, a minor difference or none at all between a hardened network IP for LTE and a traditional public LTE network?
Gregory Brown
I think the major difference, and this is being talked about now, is how you design the network for capacity and throughput. So in a Public Safety network, it has to be instant on, always on and available, regardless of any instance and regardless of location. As people talk about utilizing carrier networks, they're not designed like that. They're not hardened like that. They're designed for consumer cellular usage. So as the Public Safety officials design these networks going forward, they will design them with a hardened, mission-critical priority in preemption, which is appropriate, for narrowband voice and priority access and preemption, I should say, for data as well. But they're different networks and they're designed differently. And there is no substitute for a hardened Public Safety private network that has spectrum that is dedicated for those events and not designed to manage congestion or peak load. It has to be always available, always on. That's the primary difference.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch
First, Greg, if you don't mind to update us on -- just give us a little bit more color on the expense cuts in Networks post-disposal. You said that you're going to transfer 7,500 employees. Maybe you can say out of how many or give us details on the expense cuts themselves. And then on the handset side, you said in the past that Android should be achieving or getting to mid-30s kind of gross margin. Now that you went with the first DROID, you went through almost a whole cycle. Can you look back and say you touched these levels? And then also if you can project going forward, is mid-30s still a good proxy for margins? The last thing is just to update Android in Europe. I haven't heard on this call any discussions of that region.
Gregory Brown
In terms of Networks, we highlighted the 7,500 people because that represents the employee base that is expected to transfer to Nokia Siemens at year end when the transaction's complete. As you can see with our Q2 results and a 19.8% operating margin, by far, best-in-class compared to any other infrastructure provider. And even with Q3, with comparable revenue, with operating margin down, we still expect very strong financial contribution of Networks, and we don't anticipate at this point any significant expense restructuring on the Networks side between now and the end of the year.
Sanjay Jha
Tal, in terms of gross margin for Smartphones, if you look, our gross margins quarter-over-quarter have gone up from last quarter to this quarter, largely driven by the Smartphone mix. In terms of just Smartphone gross margin, we're not quite in the 30s. I think the market today is low- to mid-30s, leaving aside some outliers. I anticipate that we have an opportunity in the high end to get to that. But remember that we have a much broader portfolio. Particularly in second half this year, we will launch what I'd classify as lower-end Smartphones. That clearly grows our volume base. But that product mix will determine the overall Smartphone volume. I anticipate, if you take the mix into account, that we are not going to be meaningfully away from where the industry is converging to. So I feel pretty good about the Smartphone gross margin trajectory we have here. And your second question was Europe. Actually, we have a pretty good position in Europe for second half. I don't think that you will see a dramatic investment from us in Europe. And in Europe, probably, our brand name is most challenged, and it requires the largest amount of investment. You will see us be present in meaningful ways, but we will not -- we will do that with particular carriers in particular regions. You won't see us go to Europe with a large campaign in 2010.

Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind talking a little about your OpEx plans in the Phones division. I see that it's up a little bit. And this particular quarter, I'm wondering if we should think of that at the beginning as the same trends and any thoughts that you can give us about what type of revenue level you'd like to be at for scale in that business to get to the mid-single digits target would be helpful.
Sanjay Jha
Jeff, I think any increase in our OpEx will be success-based. It will be -- if we are confident that we could see that a modest amount of investment could drive revenue and bottom line operating earning for us, I think we will make those investments. Particularly, I'd think, in the second half, my concern is that there will be very large spending on marketing from multiple different places and that we would have to spend some dollars to make sure that our brand relevancy is communicated to the consumers. I think that's probably one place that I see, if we can justify that on the quarterly shipment or in a very short period of time, I think that I could see myself making a decision where we go and make some investments. In terms of operating expense, I feel that I guided you that year-on-year, my operating expenses will be roughly flat. And I think that continues to be my intent, though, if we begin to see opportunities which, with modest investment, we can address, I will consider that. The investment this quarter, I would not necessarily take as a trend.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital
Okay. Any thoughts on where you would like to be over time on the operating margin side?
Sanjay Jha
I commented a little earlier on that. I've always said high single digit, low double digit is where I think it's rational to anticipate. But I obviously think that it'll take us a little while to get there. The biggest issue there for us is driving scale in our Smartphone business. You would see that as we go forward towards second half this year, we begin to get profitable. I think to get to those operating profit numbers, we need to build our scale a little further. And I anticipate that we will get to those numbers at some point.
Jeffrey Kvaal - Barclays Capital
Okay. A little further or quite a bit further, I guess.
Sanjay Jha
Somewhere in between those two.

Our last question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG
Question for Sanjay: Going back to some of the comments you made about carrier promotions, I would've thought that by now you would've had basically those locked down on most of your Smartphone launches for the whole of the back half. Is that not the case? And then kind of what's linked to that really, is that let's suppose you do 3Â½ million Smartphones in Q3. You'd have to do 5 million to 6 million, I guess, to hit the high end of your range. And that ramp in Q4, what is giving that confidence if the carrier promotions aren't locked down right now? Is it geographic expansion? Is it just product skews? Or just how should we think about that?
Sanjay Jha
Kulbinder, I have a pretty good visibility. I don't have very good visibility. Let me just go back to the guidance for one second. I feel I've come back to this subject for the third time. I just want to be clear. There's supply constraint, there's some uncertainty in macroeconomic and there is, in my mind, at least, there is tremendous amount of uncertainty about the competitive landscape and how much money each of the OEMs or OS providers will spend in the marketplace in fourth quarter. I think that there is some uncertainty. All those three things are making me somewhat more careful in my guidance. So I want you to understand the guidance part. To the question about what the carriers will do, yes, I have pretty good visibility. But I don't think that we are yet clear as to how the dynamic between RIM OS, iPhone, Windows Mobile and Android will play out in fourth quarter to each OS providers will put behind that. I think that that's creating some uncertainty. It will be a very competitive marketplace. In terms of your numbers, I feel, again, very confident about the range. And I think that I have enough visibility to say that, that range is a good range to communicate to you right now.
Kulbinder Garcha - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG
Okay. This is for both Greg and Sanjay, I guess, and Ed. At what point can Motorola -- will you communicate how the balance sheet of the two businesses will look? Is that something we have to wait right until before the separation to compare it, you think? Or can we find out sooner?
Edward Fitzpatrick
We're still going through that. As you know, we're going to be filing amendments to the initial Form 10 that was filed. We're working through that. And in the next filing, our next filing or two amendments that we make, we will be providing more color on the details in the balance sheet, and such items won't get finalized until we do the actual separation. But we will provide more color once we sort through that over the next quarter or so.
