Good morning. My name is Gennetta and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, Iâd like to welcome everyone to the Transcend Services second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) Mr. Gerdes, you may begin your conference.
Larry Gerdes
Thank you, Gennetta. Good morning. I am Larry Gerdes, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Transcend Services Inc. Joining me today for this conference call are Lance Cornell, Transcend's Chief Financial Officer; and Susan McGrogan, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This call is regarding Transcend's operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. After we discuss our financial and operational results, we will conduct a question-and-answer period.
Now, I will ask Lance to state our disclaimer.
Lance Cornell
Thanks, good morning. We would like to ensure that everyone understands that our commentary and responses during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements dealing with topics such as our business strategy, our anticipated future results, our service offerings, our relationships with other companies or customers and our ultimate role in the market. There is the risk that these forward-looking statements or predictions may differ materially from results because of factors such as company decisions, market conditions, business relationships and/or performance of various third parties associated with Transcend including but not limited to their access to capital and their financial condition.
Please realize that we will not necessarily provide updates to any such statements other than as required by law. Finally, more information about potential risk factors is included in the second quarter press release and the periodic reports that the company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Larry Gerdes
Thanks, Lance. Before I start my comments, I would like to congratulate Lance on receiving an honor recently as CFO of the Year for the State of Georgia by the Atlanta Business Chronicle. Weâre very proud of what Lance has done here the last 5.5 years at Transcend and it was recognition well deserved.
We are very pleased with our results for the second quarter and the progress we've made on a number of our initiatives, particularly our gross profit margin improvement initiatives. We will speak to these in more detail in a few minutes.
Now, Iâd like to turn the call over to Lance to discuss our financial results.
Lance Cornell
Thank you. Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 increased 31% to $22,209,000 compared to $16,966,000 for the second quarter of 2009. Excluding revenue contributed by our two most recent acquisitions, revenue increased 12% which is in line with our goal of 10% to 15% organic growth.
Gross profit increased 31% to $8,031,000 for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $6,115,000 for the second quarter of 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 36% for both periods. But more importantly, we increased our gross profit margin by two full percentage points compared to the first quarter of this year from 34% to 36% and we will cover the reasons for the increase in a moment when we discuss operations.
Operating income was $2,692,000 for the second quarter of 2010 which included $601,000 related to the bid to acquire Spheris and a $445,000 pre-tax non-cash cumulative stock compensation expense adjustment for the period January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2010. Excluding these costs, non-GAAP operating income increased 31% to $3,738,000 or 17% of revenue compared to $2,822,000 or 17% of revenue for the second quarter of 2009. Like the gross profit margin, this also represents a two percentage point increase compared to the first quarter of this year on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was approximately 41% compared to 37% in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in the effective rate is due primarily to permanent book tax differences related to the cumulative stock compensation adjustment. And this is a discrete item for the second quarter and we expect the rate to return to the 38% to 39% range for the balance of the year, barring any unusual tax situations.
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $1,568,000 or $0.15 per diluted share including the $1,046,000 of costs that I just mentioned. Excluding these costs, non-GAAP net income increased 29% to $2,273,000 or $0.21 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $1,756,000 or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009. Just as a reminder, the impact of our December 2009 issuance of 1,725,000 shares of common stock in a public offering is approximately negative $0.03 per diluted share each quarter.
Our balance sheet continues to be healthy. We had $27,735,000 of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of June 30. This is down by a little over $1 million from March 31 due primarily to Spheris acquisition related expenses, settlement of outstanding lease obligations and higher than normal capital expenditures.
Our capital expenditures were $1,373,000 for the second quarter, bringing the total for the year to $2,747,000. And the year-to-date total includes $1,635,000 of capitalized software development costs primarily related to our next generation transcription platform and approximately $600,000 related to storage and voice capture capacity expansions at our data centers.
We expect capitalized software development costs to remain above typical historical rates for the remainder of the year. Two other balance sheet highlights are the fact that we have only 39 days of revenue in accounts receivable and that we have only $2,067,000 of debt outstanding as of June 30.
Let me expand for a minute on our stock compensation adjustment. We implemented a new equity award tracking system in the second quarter and during the implementation, we determined that our previous compensation expense calculation for awards granted since January 1, 2006 had used forfeiture rates, and our estimates proved to be too high as a result of higher employee retention, more equity awards for vesting and we realized we had to make an adjustment to ensure that the cumulative expense masked the value of the awards that had actually vested.
And this was partially offset by a discovery that our volatility factors were too high resulting in excessive compensation over that same period of time. So we concluded that we needed to record additional pre-tax non-cash stock compensation expense of the $445,000 in the second quarter. We will also a record an additional $231,000 pre-tax stock compensation adjustment effective in the first quarter of 2010 bringing the pre-tax total to $676,000 year to date.
We determined that these adjustments weren't material to any prior period and therefore did not require restatement of any previous filings. Again, these are non-cash adjustments and we do expect the impact of future stock compensation expense to be immaterial.
Let me wrap up by commenting briefly on acquisitions. We continue to work an active acquisition pipeline and we are anxious to put the money we raised in December to good use. But we will remain disciplined in our valuation approach as well as our assessment of the cultural and technological fit of the potential acquired companies and we hope to complete one or more acquisitions before year end.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Susan for a discussion of our operations.
Susan McGrogan
Thanks, Lance. I'm pleased to report that our customer retention rates remained strong at approximately 99% based on annualized revenue. We estimate that sales closed during the second quarter will generate between $1.6 million and $2 million of annual revenue per year once fully implemented.
In addition, we also signed two important agreements with significant future revenue potential. The first is in agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group which enables us to market under the HPG umbrella to roughly 1100 member hospitals including over 160 Hospital Corporation of America, HCA, hospitals.
Second, we recently signed an agreement with Child Healthcare Corporation of America, CHCA, a system with over 20,000 physicians and 43 member hospitals as one of two preferred vendors of transcription services. Our sales over the last year have been satisfactory but we know we can do better. I'm encouraged by the recent momentum we are seeing under our preferred vendor agreements.
The most gratifying highlight of the second quarter for me was our two percentage point improvement in our gross profit margin over the first quarter of this year. Numerous people in our organization deserve credit for the roles they played in this improvement.
Our implementation team and field ops team increased our BeyondTXT speech recognition usage to 72% of our BeyondTXT volume, up from 67% in the first quarter of this year. They also continued to migrate customers to our BeyondTXT platform even though our progress in migrating former MDSI customers to BeyondTXT continue to be slower than we would like.
We are moving ahead and have visibilities to converting at least 40% of the MDI business by year end but customer retention is our first priority and we will move at our customers' pace. Our operation managers worked to increase our offshore volume to approximately 17% of our total volume in the second quarter, up from 16% in the first.
We brought out some equipment leases to reduce expenses. Our human resources team worked closely with our operations managers to reduce operating costs and improve the productivity of our medical language specialists. All of these initiatives came together to contribute to the overall improvement in gross margins and I'm very proud of the team for this accomplishment. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Larry.
Larry Gerdes
Thanks, Susan. I'd like to give you our perspective on the industry and the status of our technology initiatives. The transcription industry is evolving rapidly in response to our customers. Technology is increasingly becoming a barrier to growth for smaller transcription companies.
Competition continues to be strong and several of our competitors are pricing very aggressively. Transcend has never chased extremely low-margin business and we know that our level of service is a differentiator.
Overall pricing in the industry is certainly down compared to where it was five years ago, yet we have been able to improve gross margins during this timeframe. Our strategy will be to continue to offer the best service at a reasonable price. We believe this is the best approach for long-term success.
Under the banner of healthcare reform, hospitals are analyzing how the newly released definition of meaningful use of electronic health records applies to them. We continue to believe that robust narrative content should and will continue to be an important component of medical records and that dictation volume should actually increase as more types of work are dictated.
This increased volume may be offset to some degree by having physicians input certain types of data into template-based electronic medical record systems. The net result will be more complex records that are hybrids of discrete data entry and narrative content. We maintain that verifying and editing narrative content is a task performed most efficiently by our medical language specialists. But we will also provide solutions to hospitals that prefer to mandate that their physicians do their own editing.
In response to the needs of our market, we are undertaking two smaller and one very large technology initiative. The first of our two smaller initiatives take advantage of the XML tag structured data formats of our reports to provide data to our hospitals that can't be retrieved from simple text-based reports.
Our first application in this area is called BeyondAlerts. It is basically an alerting system to help hospital personnel track core measures by mining transcribed data for certain word patterns and conditions that may indicate a patient needs to be tracked more closely. We are still in the pilot phase and we don't expect this offering to produce significant revenue until at least 2012. But these types of offerings increase the value of our core transcription service and could prove transformative in the long run.
Our second initiative is BeyondSpeech, our physicianâs self-edit solution. With BeyondSpeech, physicians dictate, receive a draft immediately and edit that draft themselves or send it back to us if they are too busy. Our initial implementations will be in radiology.
We are close to going live at our first two hospitals and have several more lined up behind those. We are excited about expanding BeyondSpeech to areas outside of radiology in the future.
By far, our largest initiative is the development of our next-generation transcription platform. This platform will be offered under a software as a service or SaaS model, and is being designed for hospitals that have their own in-house transcription department and want to increase efficiency by moving to a speech recognition enabled platform.
The new platform will continue to integrate speech recognition capabilities from our speech partner, Multimodal Technologies. This offering will allow us to compete in the in-house market which was previously closed to Transcend.
Combined with BeyondSpeech, it allows us to offer larger systems, a broad set of solutions to meet a variety of clinical documentation models from in-house transcription to physician self edit to full outsourcing, we are still on track for general availability at the beginning of 2011. We are very excited about Transcend's role in the industry as the need for healthcare documentation evolves and the adoption of meaningful use of electronic medical records increases.
I want to thank our customers for placing their trust in Transcend and our employees for providing excellent service to and innovative solutions for our customers. At this point, we would like to open up the lines for your questions. Gennetta?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator instructions) Your first audio question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the color.
Larry Gerdes
Good morning, Tom.
Susan McGrogan
Good morning.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
A couple of questions, if I could. I guess just first, sort of a macro question, seems like hospital utilization has been weak. Wondering how you're sort of factoring that into your expectations or budgets and if it sort of changed at all year to date and if you're seeing any particular geographies that maybe are worse or better than others?
Lance Cornell
Now, weâve read the reports that hospital utilization is down and you know, we have a normal ebb and flow within our hospitals. It is possible that that did have some impact on us in the second quarter but it's difficult for us to quantify. And it's not large enough to have a real meaningful impact for us at this time.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Okay. On the acquisition side, you gave a little bit of color in terms of thoughts about an active pipeline, I guess and hoping to get a deal done or more by the end of the year. Maybe can you just provide some more perspective on that topic? Have you actually passed on opportunities due to pricing or other issues? And maybe sort of what are the pricing dynamics that you are seeing out there and when you say there's an active pipeline, is there any way to give us a little bit better frame of reference?
Larry Gerdes
Sure. We have had several opportunities this year that we haven't been able to get together on valuation. And it's always our strategy to remain disciplined about valuation and sometimes it's just not the right time. So, some of those have gone away or at least are back in the wings for at least the current timeframe. Weâve also â we've had a number of smaller opportunities that frankly we sort of put in a second tier in terms of our pipeline as we focused on some of the larger ones and by larger, I typically differentiate them between under $10 million and over $10 million transcription companies.
And so our primary focus is on the ones that are over $10 million although we certainly aren't opposed to looking at some in the $5 million to $10 million range as well. So that's where we are right now. Of course, it's â we can't say a whole lot more than that in terms of likelihood of timing of any particular transactions.
Lance Cornell
One thing, Tom, that I would add. You had a question about valuations. I think it's as much a factor of the ownership structure of the company and the needs of the company as it is valuation. So like we said in our comments, where a company needs to access our technology or needs access to some other capacity that Transcend provides, I think that will impact the valuation. If the company is larger and more independent with its technology and with its future strategy, that might be a place where valuation will be higher than we can support.
And it's not lost on any of us here that we really wanted to try to get an acquisition done by the end of the second quarter because we want to make use of the funds we raised in the offering, but we also want to do it the right way. So it's just taking us a little longer than we thought.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Right. Right. The ones that you said you maybe couldn't agree on valuation, were they ultimately acquired or have they sort of found no buyers at this point?
Larry Gerdes
They have not been acquired. It doesn't mean they won't continue to try, but they have not.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Okay. Thatâs interesting.
Susan McGrogan
This is Sue. I would also like to say, we placed a high value on cultural fit and the integration and what platforms they're on. We really look at that very closely.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Sure.
Susan McGrogan
That's important.
Lance Cornell
Yes, some of the valuation issues have been because the sellers see significant upside potential in their pipelines and things like that in the future and the issue is just to what degree do you pay for that future now. And some of them would prefer to run the company for a little bit and execute and if they are successful in generating those kinds of results, then their valuations will go up.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Right, right. My last question here just for now. I noticed on the announcement on the Child Health Corporation of America that you sort of said they had 20,000 physicians in addition to the 43 hospitals. I think in the past, you've sort of talked about the physician market not necessarily being that attractive. Is there some signal that you might go after some of those physicians for a transcription or was that just to frame the entity?
Susan McGrogan
I think it was both, frame the entity and we're also seeing a trend that physicians, the end user, we're seeing more and more of the physicians especially as we get into front-end speech, dealing with physicians directly and as hospitals are buying clinics, we're seeing a lot more clinic dictation and dealing with physicians directly.
Larry Gerdes
But that's associated with hospitals.
Susan McGrogan
Exactly, associated with hospitals. So we're not going after the physician market but it's just a natural progression as our hospitals buy clinics and things.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Got it. Thank you.
Susan McGrogan
But we were excited about the 43 hospitals for sure.
Tom Gallucci â Lazard Capital Markets
Sure. Sure. All right. Thank you.
Larry Gerdes
Next one.
Operator
Your next audio question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Hey, good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up with a quick question on some of the migration of MDSI clients onto the BeyondTXT platform. It sounds like you had a little more success this quarter and I think, Sue, you mentioned that can get up to 40% by year end. So one, could you maybe discuss where you are today so we get a feel for how much improvement is left?
And then the number two, kind of what is driving the better outlook? Are you incenting them to switch differently or just is it a level of comfort they're getting with you as you are there to push that switch forward?
Susan McGrogan
Thanks. In Q2, we had one large hospital switch and then 20 small private physician groups. So I don't think it was very significant in Q2.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Okay.
Susan McGrogan
We definitely have a lot more traction going to the end of the year. Towards the end of the year, we estimate about 40% but I mean the caveat is that we don't want to risk. It's really at the customer pace. The customers have to feel comfortable with us and that we can provide just as good a service on our platform as on the existing platform and we have a very good customer relationship with all of our customers. And we don't want to kind of force them and put them on a schedule that may be too aggressive for them.
Lance Cornell
A good analogy might be MDI number one.
Susan McGrogan
Right.
Lance Cornell
Sue's company that we acquired back in the beginning of 2005, it was about three years, wouldn't you say?
Susan McGrogan
Yes.
Lance Cornell
Before we migrated the bulk of those customers over to our BeyondTXT platform. We think we can do it more quickly than that. We took a pretty slow approach on that one.
Susan McGrogan
We do but I think we can improve â we improved the margins without them and my feeling is there's nothing worse than a lost customer. The margin on zero revenue is zero.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Sure. And that makes sense. And then I guess, Lance, a little bit of a follow-up to that. As we think of the gross margin profile, obviously a fantastic job this quarter. It seems like most of that should be reasonably sustainable if we think of the lease buyouts and taking the core business up to a higher speech rack and moving off â do you view that as a sustainable gross margin looking forward if you don't do a deal or kind of how might we see that fluctuate into Q3 and Q4?
Lance Cornell
Yeah. As we look forward, there are definitely some factors, some positive and negative factors but the bulk of them are positive. Certainly, the things we did in Q2 were not one-time things. They were sustainable. And going forward there, we have a number of initiatives and MDSI is only one of those. We have others as well, including offshore for example. We hired a veteran operations manager in the industry to focus on our offshore relationships and she's got a lot of experience in India. So we will continue to drive those numbers up.
So we've got a lot of initiatives underway that would â that in our mind would lend ourselves toward the possibility of higher gross margins in the future and the offsetting factor would be the fact â and we've discussed this before, you know, to the extent that we are selling large system deals or just in general, the new pricing on new sales is typically lower than pricing on historical sales. So that would tend to bring margins down a little bit. Net-net of those two is that we are pretty confident we still have some room for improvement.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Okay. And that kind of leads to my next question. Obviously, some good success partnering up as a preferred vendor or with the HealthTrust and the GPO and I'm curious with those type of relationships what the margin looks like. I assume to get in the GPO. There is a little bit of price concessions there. Is that a fair assumption?
Larry Gerdes
Yeah. The GPO pricing is typically pretty low and that is one of the reasons that it took us a while to get on the HPG contract as we worked through those negotiations. But it's within â obviously, we felt that it was acceptable and we could make money doing it.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Two more quick ones and then I'll hop off, first, just on the FAS 141R charges in the first two quarters. Do you see that spilling into Q3? I assume unless there is a deal done, those should kind of dissipate and we won't see any?
Lance Cornell
No. The only â there's not too much of an impact. We are constantly changing all the estimates that go into the various awardsâ¦.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Fair enough.
Lance Cornell
â¦ and as does every company, but we don't really see any material impact going forward.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Okay. And then last question maybe for Larry, just your thoughts on the sales infrastructure today and maybe what you're looking at investing in there. I know you have talked a lot about attacking some of the bigger health systems and having some staff there to assist with that, but just any color on what that looks like going forward would be great. Thanks.
Larry Gerdes
I'll let Sue add because she has been driving sales pretty hard. But one thing I would say that I'm particularly excited about. As we get further along with our three initiatives I mentioned earlier, I think the clinical data world is going to add a new dimension to Transcend and I'm already seeing. We've got sales folks in for training today and tomorrow and just starting to talk about clinical data and how it drives a hospital's decisions is to me very fulfilling.
The other thing I would suggest is that I'm very excited about what the platform solution can provide to the market because now we can go after that large market that remains that's an old technology but still has an in-house staff. So I think that those two things together play a meaningful role in where Transcend is positioned in the future.
More to the point of your question, I want Sue to respond to because she's been working very hard in the sales world and we have seen results already in the last two months.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Okay. Great.
Susan McGrogan
You know, as we said, I mean we're not satisfied with where our sales have been, we want to improve. And I believe that this business is all about relationships. Really, we want to leverage our existing relationships which we can do with HPG because we do have a lot of relationships within HCA even though we have not tapped because we weren't on the list.
I just feel â the sales teams in today and tomorrow and we really have a lot of momentum and I feel really good about where we are going.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Maybe one â one quick follow-up just, Larry, on something you said. If we think about the platform technology and that being on track to launch at the start of 2011, when would you actually start selling that product or going out to customers? I mean, should we think of that as something that might be able to start generating revenue in the first half of 2011 or will you start selling it in the first half of 2011 and maybe back half and into 2012 is where we'll see some of the uplift?
Susan McGrogan
We are actually, Ryan, we're actually doing it now. Just before this call, I was just on a call with a customer that wants a platform. So I mean we are launching the platform. We're talking about it now to not only customers, but MTSOs and we're already seeing a high demand for it.
Lance Cornell
Yeah. We're at sort of that awkward point where we're roughly five months out from general availability. So we're certainly talking about it. You can get it into the pipeline certainly by the time you get to Q4. There's no problem selling it.
Larry Gerdes
And we would actually three pilots this fall.
Lance Cornell
Yeah.
Larry Gerdes
One, we want a transcription company and weâve got the verbal decision from a $5 million transcription company to come on. So we can make sure that the platform meets their needs.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Right.
Larry Gerdes
Two, we will take one of our existing customers and move them seamlessly onto it to test it and then three like Sue and Lance both said, we are already talking to people who want platform solutions. So we would like to have one of those by October and November to be a beta. So, I think you will see contributions by the second quarter.
Ryan Daniels â William Blair
Okay. Perfect. Thanks for all the color and nice quarter, guys.
Lance Cornell
Thanks.

Your next audio question comes from the line of Brad Hoover with Sidoti & Company.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Hi. Good morning.
Larry Gerdes
Good morning.
Susan McGrogan
Good morning
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Just to go back to the gross margin, Sue, if you could just maybe elaborate on some of the types of things that HR did in conjunction with operational management managers to reduce cost and kind of how they helped increase transcription productivity?
Susan McGrogan
Well, we've constantly looked at transcription productivity because we want our transcriptionists to be proficient on editing, that the happier they'll be. So weâve looked at the regional ops with HR and we looked at people that were not eligible for benefits and probably haven't been for a while and we took them off. We gave them some time to raise their productivity and if they didn't, we took them off benefits and what we found is that it was just general housekeeping with regard to combination between the HR staff and our regional operation managers. So, we have a very strong new VP of HR and she's made a lot of changes you know with her doing a lot of things for MLS retention, but there's some people that we are draining in terms of our benefits.
Lance Cornell
In this industry, you are constantly managing a lot of full-time, part-time and people shifting back and forth from period to period. And I think we've just done a better job of focusing on that and making sure that we are managing low producers and moving them up appropriately whenever they can.
Susan McGrogan
One of the things that I'm most excited about is our volumes of the editor. I mean, really â it was a relatively easy change in working with our partners, MultiModal and also with our customers to standardize, standardizing a few things and it just jumped and we'll continue to see an improvement on the volumes in the editing. It went from 67 to 72 and I really think we're going to see a significant increase as we go forward.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Okay. Thanks for the color. So that's 60 years, so 72 from 67, that'sâ¦
Susan McGrogan
67% volume to 72%.
Lance Cornell
Of the BeyondTXT volume.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Exactly. And that's more broad based, not just a couple large clients, is that accurate?
Susan McGrogan
Correct.
Larry Gerdes
That's right.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
And just turning to the new business sold in the quarter, was that below kind of your expectations and if so, kind of why â maybe why did we see the lower number in the quarter?
Susan McGrogan
Yes. It definitely was below expectations. I mean, we just have to do better. And I think there were some deals that dropped right out for the quarter and there was â we were just disappointed.
Larry Gerdes
Again, we had a strong Q1.
Susan McGrogan
We had a strong Q1, exactly.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Okay.
Susan McGrogan
But, yes, in a perfect world, I mean, Iâm disappointed and thatâs for sure.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Okay. And then just on the G&A, the $2.7 million, was there any cost in there from BeyondAlerts pilots or anything with that development in there at all?
Lance Cornell
There is some cost that's getting capitalized related to the actual product itself and not too much cost in the SG&A section for â other than that. I take that back. There's probably about $50,000 or so of non-capitalized cost that's incremental.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Okay. So just minimal, okay. And then just lastly, I know you've been doing some rebranding on the marketing front and perhaps being a little more aggressive this year with marketing. I think you also had hired a new marketing manager. Is that why we saw sales and marketing expense up in the quarter or kind of what specifically drove that up a little bit?
Susan McGrogan
Yeah. We are doing some marketing and we've got some ships [ph], we sponsored some things that we haven't in the past. We were at HSMA in Las Vegas and we actually sponsored the welcome dinner which we haven't done. We don't normally do things like that but we are doing a lot of branding and marketing to get our name out there.
Larry Gerdes
Yeah. We had a website overhaul and collaterals overhaul, things like that.
Brad Hoover â Sidoti & Company
Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Larry Gerdes
Thank you.
Lance Cornell
Thanks Brad.

Our next audio question comes from the line of Lenny Dunn with Freedom Investors.
Lenny Dunn â Freedom Investors
Good morning and good quarter, a little confusing because of various charges but had a chance to read it thoroughly. I think it was a very good quarter. It would appear to me that beyond the obvious potential revenue stream from these new initiatives, you also are going to be locking in clients because you're offering a full service period, not just transcription.
And if people buy more than one product from you, they are more likely to be permanent clients. So, I believe that that is something to look forward to. But going forward as you said to the previous caller, there is going to be no extraordinary. So we'll be seeing clean things to look at, that would be accurate?
Larry Gerdes
Yeah. Lenny, let me just give you my color on it. I was extremely happy with two things for the quarter. One was this tremendous effort that Sue and Lance and our various teams did on the margin improvement. I think that was a great job. And then two, that carried on down the P&L.
So from an internal standpoint when we look at our plans and when we look where we wanted to be, for us to hit $0.21 outside of extraordinary items was tremendous especially having picked up that dilution of the increased number of shares. So I am like you. I kind of look at run rates and where the structure of the company is and we were just tickled pink with where our margins at our $0.21 ended up. So I think it portends great for our future and I think your comments about being a more fully serviced company, and competing on more fronts and deepening that relationship is significant.
Susan McGrogan
Anything we can do to increase our customer stickiness is a good thing.
Lenny Dunn â Freedom Investors
No question about that. It wouldn't be a leap of faith to assume we're going to see a much better third quarter because of the higher gross margins and no extraordinary expenses and more implementation of contracts that are already sold?
Larry Gerdes
Yes.
Susan McGrogan
Yes.
Lenny Dunn â Freedom Investors
Okay. Well thank you again and again, good quarter and really, Sue, just amazing work with getting that SG&A under control there. So thank you.
Susan McGrogan
Thanks Lenny.

Your next audio question comes from the line of Sasha Kostadinov with Shaker Investments.
Sasha Kostadinov â Shaker Investments
Yeah. Hi, I echo the congratulations but I apologize if you already answered this question. What accounted for the significant quarter-over-quarter change in your gross profit margin?
Larry Gerdes
It was a series â it wasn't any one thing. It was a series of numerous initiatives from increasing the percentage of our volume that was going through speech recognition, increasing offshore volumes, working on productivity and cost issues within our operations infrastructure and a little bit of progress on the MDSI conversion front. Just â it was no single thing. It was a half a dozen different initiatives that all worked together to drive the results.
Susan McGrogan
It's just the blocking and tackling of transcription really. I mean it's not â there wasn't anything, it's just blocking and tackling.
Sasha Kostadinov â Shaker Investments
Okay. So as a run rate, is this 36% level a fair level for me to expect going forward?
Larry Gerdes
Yeah. We still have some room for improvement from some of the same initiatives that drove the improvement in Q2. And as we told everybody, pricing is definitely competitive in the industry and new sales could be at lower prices especially for large systems sales and that sort of thing which could address the margins the other way and our anticipation is that the net result of those two can still be positive.
Sasha Kostadinov â Shaker Investments
Okay. Thank you very much.
Larry Gerdes
Thank you.

Stephanie Haggerty â Register Financial
Good morning guys.
Larry Gerdes
Good morning, Stephanie.
Susan McGrogan
Good morning, Stephanie.
Stephanie Haggerty â Register Financial
I see youâve been hard at work. I just wanted to ask if there has been any big changes in the marketplace since the MedQuist-Spheris combination and by asking that, I mean are there sales folks available? Are there accounts available who are â just can't figure out what this new animal is and have you picked up any salespeople? How many do you have right now?
Larry Gerdes
Sue, do you want to answer that?
Susan McGrogan
Sure, in terms of the â what the market is looking like, I think everyone is just relatively status quo. In terms of MedQuist, I think has done a very good job of staying close to those Spheris customers and keeping great people on board. We met a lot of them through the due diligence and â but we are seeing some people. I mean, we've had some folks contact us, sales and otherwise and we are seeing some RFPs, but no real â nothing that would be usual or out of the ordinary. In terms of sales, we have five sales team members and we are looking for â to replace Leo's position which we have not done yet.
Stephanie Haggerty â Register Financial
Okay. Keep it up, guys.
Larry Gerdes
Thank you.

Your next audio question comes from the line of Craig Hoagland with Anderson, Hoagland and Associates.
Craig Hoagland â Anderson Hoagland and Associates
You mentioned one of the factors in the uptick in the gross margin sequentially was buying equipment that had previously been leased. I was just wondering how much of the 200 basis point improvement would be ascribed to that?
Lance Cornell
It was in the neighborhood of $40,000 a month. And it was bought out probably â we probably saw two months of that impact. I'm trying to remember the exact date. It wasn't the full impact to the quarter but it was most of it.
Craig Hoagland â Anderson Hoagland and Associates
About 80,000.
Lance Cornell
Yes. That sounds about right.
Craig Hoagland â Anderson Hoagland and Associates
Okay. And I guess the other â I just really have a comment which is I'm really pleased to hear how careful you are being with your acquisition review. The company seems to â there's some risk on the balance sheet in that you've raised so much cash and how that cash is put to work and the returns on that investment are â to a large extent going to determine the path of the stock going forward. And I just really would encourage you to take your time and be careful and don't let the pressure of that cash lead to doing any deals.
Larry Gerdes
We agree with you. Thank you.
Craig Hoagland â Anderson Hoagland and Associates
Okay. Thanks.
Susan McGrogan
Thank you.

(Operator instructions) At this time, you have no further audio questions.
Larry Gerdes
Okay. Thank you, Gennetta. Just in closing, again I would like to recognize what our team did with this margin effort this last quarter. I think it's a tremendous indication of rising to the occasion and we're more excited than we have ever been about that area of our P&L and like was just commented, we are going to remain very cautious but active in the acquisition world.
And we're going to focus very hard on taking advantage of these two new national contracts, weâve got as Sue continues to build the sales team. We are still focused on maintaining organic growth rates of 10% to 15%. We would love to supplement that with well-chosen acquisitions.
But I am particularly excited about the fact that we continue to progress on our initiatives to position Transcend in the clinical data world in a way that will play a big role in a very fast changing marketplace. So we appreciate all of your support. We look forward to the next quarter and the rest of the year with the momentum we are seeing in the company. Thank you and look forward to our next call.
