Please standby. Good day. And welcome to the Fairchild Third Quarter Earnings -- 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Just a reminder that today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Janson. Please go ahead.
Dan Janson
Good morning. And thank you for dialing into Fairchild Semiconductor's third quarter 2014 financial results conference call. With me today is Mark Thompson, Fairchild's Chairman and CEO; and Mark Frey, Executive Vice President and CFO.
Let me begin by mentioning that we'll be attending the Morgan Stanley Corporate Access Day in Boston on November 4th, the Credit Suisse Tech Conference in Scottsdale on December 3rd and the Raymond James Systems, Semiconductors, Software & Supply Chain Conference in New York on December 9th.
We'll start today's call with Mark Frey, who will review our third quarter financial results and discuss the current status of fourth quarter business. Mark Thompson will then discuss our product line results, end markets and operational performance in more detail. Finally, we'll reserve time for questions-and-answers.
This call is scheduled to last approximately 60 minutes and is being simultaneously webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website at fairchildsemi.com. A replay for this call will be publicly available for approximately 30 days.
Fairchild management will be making forward-looking statements in this conference call. These statements, including all statements about future results and performance, are made based on assumptions and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties.
Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. A discussion of these risk factors is provided in quarterly and annual reports we file with the SEC.
In addition, during this call, we may refer to adjusted or other financial measures that are not prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles. We use non-GAAP measures, because they -- we believe they provide useful information about operating performance of our businesses that should be considered by investors in conjunction with GAAP measures that we also provide.
You could find a reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures at the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fairchildsemi.com. The website also contains a variety of useful information for investors, including an extensive financial section to facilitate your investment analysis.
Now, I'll turn the discussion over to Mark Frey.
Mark Frey
Thanks, Dan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm sure most of you had a chance to review our earnings press release, so I'll focus on just the key points in my comments.
For the third quarter of 2014, Fairchild reported sales of $381 million, up 3% sequentially, and 5% higher than the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted gross margin was up 2 points to 35.3%. This was above the high-end of our guidance, due primarily to better product mix and higher factory loadings in the prior quarter.
R&D and SG&A expenses were $95 million which was better than expected. Spending was down 3% from the prior quarter, due primarily to seasonally higher vacation which are paid from an accrual, lower travel expenses and ongoing cost controls.
Third quarter adjusted net income was $34 million and adjusted EPS was $0.28. The adjusted tax rate was 9%, due to the distribution of profits in lower tax regions.
Note that in our earnings release, we guided our adjusted tax rate in Q4 to be 12% plus or minus 3%. Although, every quarter is likely to have special tax items in it, we generally expect our average adjusted tax rate to remain around 12% for the foreseeable future. This reduction from the prior guidance reflects the favorable impact of expected earnings in low tax jurisdictions, as well as a Korean tax holiday related to our new eight-inch line in Bucheon.
Now Iâd like to review our third quarter sales and gross margin performance for our two major products lines. Sales were up 3% from the prior quarter for our MC Cubed business driven by higher demand from the consumer and computing end markets. MC Cubed adjusted gross margin was down slightly from the prior quarter to 41%, due primarily to lower pricing.
In our PCIA business, sales were up 2% sequentially due to significantly higher power conversation sales, primarily for mobile travel adapter application and continued growth in our product serving the automotive sector, partially offset by seasonally weaker demand in the appliance market. Adjusted gross margin was up sequentially to 33%, due primarily to higher factory loadings in the prior quarter and improved product mix.
Turning to our balance sheet, we increased internal inventory by approximately $19 million or 8% sequentially in the third quarter. This increased days of inventory to 94-days. More than $5 million of this was from raw materials that will be worked down in future quarters.
Roughly $3 million of the increase is due to building some bridge inventory to support our manufacturing footprint consolidation. We expect to add around another $10 million of inventory to support this project in the fourth quarter.
Days of sales outstanding or DSOs decreased to 34 days and payables to 41 days. Free cash flow was $42 million for the third quarter. We ended the third quarter with total cash and securities exceeding our debt by $137 million, which was up $17 million from the prior quarter despite repurchasing $25 million in stock.
Weâve completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in September. Fairchildâs solid balance sheet and compelling business strategy resulted in a very positive response to the financing with the deal two times over subscribed.
The new facility which matures in 2019 enables us to borrow at lower interest rate at current debt and EBITDA levels, and should reduce interest expenses by more than $1 million annually. We believe maintaining the modest level of low cost debt is an important element of our overall capital structure.
Now turning to forward guidance, we expect sales to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million for the forth quarter. We expect that adjusted gross margin to be 33% to 34%, due primarily to lower sales and the impact of reduced factory loadings in the current quarter.
We anticipate R&D and SG&A spending to be $95 million to $97 million. The adjusted tax rate is forecast at 12% plus or minus 3 percentage points for the quarter. Consistent with our usual practices, we are not assuming any obligation to update this information, although, we may choose to do so before we announce fourth quarter results.
Now Iâll turn the call over to Mark Thompson.
Mark Thompson
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter to deliver solid earnings growth and strong cash flow. In my prepared remarks, I will review some of the details behind our third quarter performance. I will also discuss the current demand picture and the basis for our forth quarter guidance. We completed a well-attended investor event last quarter and I want to wrap up with the brief recap of the three key strategic takeaways.
Letâs begin with the brief review of third quarter results. We recorded solid third quarter sales growth due primarily to seasonal strength to computing in consumer markets toppled with continued growth for our power solutions for the automotive sector.
We posted record sales into the automotive market which were up 16% from the year ago quarter. We anticipated higher sales into mobile end markets for weakness at one large customer more than offset all growth at other key accounts.
Distribution sell through was roughly flat sequentially and 9% higher than a year ago quarter. This increase in sell through in 2014 is due to better supply chain management to improve product availability and keep lead time short. In addition, we have strengthened our relationship with the distributors through increase supply chain transparency, better support of samples and improved product quality.
Inventory dollars in the channel were up slightly from the prior quarter in dollars and down slightly in days to less than 10 weeks of supply. Sales into the OEM and EMS channels were down about 4% due primarily to lower demands from one large mobile customer.
Our efforts to increase sales to small and medium size customers through our distribution partners paid off and we increased total company revenue despite weakness in the direct business. Factory utilization decreased in the third quarter as we responded to lower demand and adjusted output to slightly manage channel inventory.
Now I want to share a bit more context for our portfolio guidance. Order rates for most of our end markets were lower driven through the quarter. We also saw weaker demand from two customers that is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. One large mobile and consumer-products customer is reducing demand again to exit the year with lower inventory.
This was typical for this customer in Q4 but the magnitude of the decrease across this year has been very significant as they adjust for lower demand for the products. Another large consumer product customer is significantly decreasing demand for game platform now that they have the components they need for the holiday builds. The impact of these two customers accounts for roughly half of the sequential sales decline we are guiding.
Also our distribution point of sale in Q4 is trending down approximately 3% sequentially which is seasonal. We executed well in the third quarter to maintain lean distribution channel inventory. Our guidance for the fourth quarter include from latitude to adjust shipments to keep distribution channel inventory to sequentially flat in dollars exiting this year.
The lower end of our Q4 range expresses our commitment to keep channel dollars sequentially flat or down exiting the year even the events of demand weakening further. This will position us well for the first quarter and beyond.
Turning now to our most strategic view of Fairchild. At our recent Investor Day, we presented a comprehensive view of our strategy and objectives with a focus on the next 18 months to 24 months. I want to recap three key takeaways from this event.
First, Fairchild has made significant changes to our leadership throughout the organization. We have brought in top talent from leading companies to improve areas we feel are lagging our expectations or where we could opportunistically improve our performance. We also have promoted from within in areas that are performing well.
Fairchild has been successful at attracting the top talent in the industry because weâre building a culture of success to engage employees and strong focus on delighting our customers. Second, most of the financial improvement we are targeting in the next 18 to 24 months is from an internal cost improvement from a manufacturing footprint consolidation and increased use of external capacity.
While these products -- projects are never easy, we feel the execution risk is relatively low and largely within our control due to excellent execution so far. We remain on track to significantly streamline our manufacturing operations in 2015.
Finally, while Fairchild is building a great team and improving cost and flexibility to better support our customers, we have also significantly increased our return of cash to shareholders. We expect to repurchase more than 8% of our outstanding shares in 2014 and to continue returning 100% of our excess through cash flow in 2015.
In closing, Fairchild reported solid financial results and strong cash flow for the third quarter. Inventory and distribution channel is lean at less than 10 weeks and lead times remain short allowing us to quickly respond to demand opportunities. We entered the fourth quarter with a lower backlog than a quarter ago due primarily to weaker demand from few significant customers while distribution sell through remains seasonal.
Our guidance reflects this impact plus some latitude to slightly manage distribution inventory. Finally, Iâm pleased with our share buyback progress and excited that weâre on track to significantly reduce our share count exiting 2014.
Thank you. And Iâll turn the call back to Dan.
Dan Janson
Thanks Mark. We will now open the call to questions. I would ask that in order to allow more of you to ask questions, we limit each person to one question and one follow-up. Thanks, and let's take the first question, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And weâll take the first question from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congrats on the solid execution. I guess the first question I have is a bigger picture one for Mark Thompson. A couple different companies have called this a cyclical downturn or seasonal adjustments in a wide range between of those two judgments on what we are seeing in the industry right now. Can you just talk a little bit about how you are seeing demand patterns, supply patterns and generally compare it maybe to last year or fourth quarters over the last couple of years, whatâs better or worse?
Mark Thompson
Yeah. So, Ross, there is a couple of moving parts to that. So, one of the things that obviously we always do when we put these together is look back at the past. One of the interesting things weâve seen now and this will be the fourth in a row is Q4 being a bigger step down than maybe a traditional seasonal view would have had and then a step up in Q1. And so far what we are seeing is consistent with that pattern. So, I think that there is a couple of different moving parts to that. One is that I think people are in general as are we are trying to contain events of any given fiscal year within the fiscal year. So, we see stronger bias to make sure that inventories are lean and such, as they exit the fourth quarter into the new quarter.
As I said if you look at the broad market, which is represented by our point of sale which has some large customers in it but mostly itâs small to medium size customers. Actually that is seasonal for the fourth quarter, so down 3%. And then we see in one case, so the handset customer that has been struggling a bit is a big chunk of what we are seeing. So, I guess Iâm reluctant as one company to call the broad market. In general, I think what we are seeing is consistent with a normal year-end inventory cycle with one or two special stories added on top of it.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Thatâs helpful. I guess as my one follow-up question for Mark Frey is on the gross margin line. How should we think about the impact of the buffer inventory and roughly $19 million or $20 million of inventory build in the third quarter impacting the fourth quarter gross margin and maybe more precisely? What would the gross margin be if you didnât have go through the buffer build to the extent thatâs an impact?
Mark Frey
Well, there was no impact in the third quarter. So we all have different models of sell through and of course it depends on whether we are building ahead from an external source from a subcon or foundry. Obviously the income statement impact to that is negligible of what we are building it internally. Of the $3 million we build, I would guess you could expect that about on average, 35% of that would generate, go down to the income statement.
However, we also look at what we build and if we think we have to build something to be cautious about future demand but that had risk to it, we set up a special reserve and we actually did set up a few other $1,000 of special reserves in the quarter. So long, the answer to that story probably on the order of about $1 million of income to Q3 and maybe 25% to 30% impact of what we indicated for Q4.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thank you.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we will take our next question from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.
Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The weakness around your large smartphone customers has been pretty well documented but on the gaming platform customer that you refer to, my assumption was that Q4 is always seasonally lower and you refer to this in your commentary. But Iâm just wondering is the magnitude of the decline more than what you were anticipating here in the fourth quarter?
Mark Thompson
Yes. So, I think your assumption is correct. I think it is the typical thing to do some Q3 stockpiling of components and then tail off in the fourth quarter. And I think so that pattern is the same. Itâs just the magnitude of -- thatâs just larger than average.
Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Thank you for that. And then in mobile, obviously setting aside your one big customer there, the team has obviously had some very good traction with the China domestic handset suppliers. I am wondering if you could just comment on how you see the shipment turns into these customers in the fourth quarter.
Mark Thompson
So weâve done very well at the leading handful of OEMs in China. And they are continuing to aggressively pursue demand. So we havenât seen a big pullback. There has been obviously some speculation about the dual consequence of the potential over-inventorying from some of those, but we havenât seen that impact yet.
Harlan Sur - J.P. Morgan
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Next we will hear from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group
Thank you. I would like to just dig into the industrial and automotive a little bit more based on your commentary. And it does seem that those segments were ahead of your expectations in the third quarter. If you can go into that a little more deeply because obviously that at least for some of your peers that seems to be a big different, and where the visibility is there, any expense that sell through against whatâs going on in distribution channel. And I guess from that, your level of confidence in the commentary about this being seasonal as you go into the fourth quarter.
Mark Thompson
Sure. So first on the industrial and automotive question. So automotive has been very, very steady growth picture for us. And I think that there has been couple of key things that I think have played out favorably and continue to play out favorably. So we had a primary focus on helping the OEMs meet their fuel economy/CO2 emissions requirements. The same problem, just expressed differently between the U.S. and Europe.
And we do that with really three categories of products. One is, is direct injection, which has been an IGBT per. The other is the ignition, so single coil per cylinder, and in fact integrated ignition control modules with an IGBT. And there, we are going from just an IGBT in the kind of $0.30 range to a module, which is more for the $1 per cylinder in addition to penetration rate. And then the third is the removal of mechanical prosthetics and replacing those with electric motors that we do to control module for.
The big thing, the big moving part of the Fair are power steering, electric water pumps next. And we are aligned with the Tiers 1 that are aligned with the OEMs that are really taking share. So, itâs a backup of share gain, ASP gain, and aligned with the right Tier 1 and the right OEMs. And so we feel very confident about the robustness of that continuing into the planning horizon.
Now industrial has been a bit less robust than automotive for sure. I mean, so if you look at some of the biggest parts of that have been affected by Europe economy somewhat and the way we count power supply, some of the appliance stuff lines up there as well. We see some caution China. So I certainly wouldnât call out industrial with the same kind of strength that automotive has called out, but itâs been I would say okay.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group
But just following up on that though, but both of those segments were better than you expected in the third quarter, generally thatâs not because of design wins, thatâs generally a function of less demand, doesnât it?
Mark Thompson
Well, itâs both, but automotive was stronger, appliance was not.
Mark Frey
Yes. Appliance is usually pretty weak in the third quarter, right because there are lot of air conditioning builds that start in the summer months, like people use the minimum buy, minimum builds onto that. So we expect it to be down in the third quarter. Automotive has probably been the area of continued strength. And weâre up 16% year-over-year. Thatâs a pretty solid growth.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group
Okay. Understood. And just a next question and with regard to gross margin and you explained Q4. Could you talk about what happens as we go in the Q1, Q2 of next year? And just so weâre not -- there is no surprises with respect to the effect of getting out of some of the fabs that are slated for closure in the second half of the year. And what impact production changes you may be doing in the fourth quarter would also have on first quarter gross margin?
Mark Thompson
Sure. Chris, obviously, we donât guide two quarters in advance. We do let you know what the momentum has been in the loading of our factory because the income statement in fact of factory loadings is generally one quarter wide. And so we have our build plans down consistently with our sales guidance for Q4. And that will have an impact -- negative impact on Q1.
The rest really remains to be seen about what their Q1 revenue profile is and obviously, we just donât know that yet. We do not think it is as pronounced as weâve seen in the last couple of years. So Iâm seeing maybe in the 100 basis point range, additional risk there but weâll have to see how the Q4 source out and then how Q1 sets up.
Chris Caso - Susquehanna Financial Group
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Next weâll hear from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley
Yes. Thanks. Mark, I want to get your view just on going back to the overall environment what seems here and for Fairchild specifically, as recently two years ago, your lead times are 12 weeks. They are now six week. So historically you used to get tripped up at times when youâve seen the shift in demand or slow down. So do you think you have kind of a cleaner read on whatâs going on? And can you give us some context in terms of what youâre seeing in customer behavior pattern, kind of September into October here?
Mark Thompson
Yeah. Sure. So I do think that we have the best read on the real environment that weâve ever had as a result of our short lead times. So what I would say describes the majority of the market is that we stand here today is a bit of caution. And whether that is a bit of caution thatâs due to broader macro economic stuff or as I commented earlier that people, they want to clean up inventory, theyâre going to do it in the fourth quarter and then see where they are as they start the year. And so thatâs the best characterization I can give.
Now, weâre early in the quarter. And so right now what weâre trending toward -- if you look at the demand pattern, weâre trending toward the top half of our estimate range. And if things we can and as we go then that will lead us more toward the bottom half. So that will help you quantify a bit as to what the run rate is so far.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley
Very helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, there has been some concerns about China. There should probably if you guys see more into the appliance business and I know Dan said seasonally this week. But what do you see from kind of an end demand picture in China broadly and then maybe specific to appliances ex-seasonality?
Mark Thompson
So what I called a bit of caution, so not a dramatic pullback but a certain caution about placing orders, the timing for placing orders. And so again because itâs a seasonally week time, itâs a little hard to read into that. But in general terms, we see probably relative to typical behavior in China a certain amount of caution.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley
Got it. If I can seek just one last one in there. If I look at the buyback in cash returns, which has been pretty strong that the first $100 million you had front end loaded that weâre very aggressive. But weâre kind of stock wise back to where you are. So how are you thinking about just kind of buybacks in the current environment?
Mark Thompson
Well, so we certainly have a sliding scale. So lower the stock price the more weâll tend to buyback. Based on our view of the prospects for Fairchild over the next three to five quarter is the current stock price is they are cheap. And we expect to buy more than a proportional amount at the current price.
Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley

Got it. Thank you.
Operator

And next weâll hear from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets

Hey guys. Thanks for the question. So for the fourth quarter, what are you guys really seeing the most weakness here? I think that sounds like MCQ knew that two customers that youâve already talked about. But perhaps, you can talk a little bit more about which end markets have the most end points and what we can expect there?
Mark Thompson

And so if I were to peel off, I guess what I described is the exception. So as you mentioned, weâve seen that there is two customer specific cases that are doing some inventory adjustments. Automotive is at the opposite end of this spectrum. Itâs very strong demand. I would say everything else is in a normal zone, if I were to look at it that way. As I said, sort of a new seasonality emerging where people do some inventory clean up in the fourth quarter which suppresses demand a little bit. But there isnât anything, any particular market that stands out from the middle of the distribution besides the one positive and the two negative exceptions.
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Okay. And then also you guys said that your lower fourth quarter guidance was a result of lower factory loadings in 3Q. But your revenues were in line for 3Q and then you guys build a healthy amount of inventory. So, I guess how does this shake out to lower than expected loadings?
Mark Thompson

Well, we actually build more in Q2 than we built in Q3. And what we build in Q2 was more of our internal parts than external, so we moved. As we begin to do the footprint consolidation, weâre moving to more external partners to manufacture. So then -- so our inventory growth has less of an impact on your income statement. So, yeah, in Q2, a lot of internal builds that helped Q3 margin. Q3, we did lower our build plan but we still build inventory. But as we said, a lot of that inventory build did not go through the income statement, it seems like raw materials. But nevertheless, that will have the negative impact on Q4. And then, I think for another question I roll forward, how that could impact Q1 and then we would begin the cycle back up again. Does that help?
Christopher Rolland - FBR Capital Markets
Yeah. Thanks guys. 
Operator

Next, weâll hear from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird

Hi. Good morning. As a follow-up to a couple of prior questions, if I remove the $3 million build from your Q3 inventory, you still have about 91 days. And the last time your inventories were about 90 days. Your gross margin went below 30% a quarter or two later. So what gives you the confidence that gross margin is not going to return to those levels in the first half of next year? And what inventory days target do you have internally post manufacturing consolidation? Thank you. 
Mark Thompson

First of all, I calculate 94 days. And I donât see our margins going below 30%. And the reason is, as we said in our Investor Day, internally, we target about, in the high 80s for normal environment in terms of our supply chain response. And as you know thatâs probably at the lower end of our peer growth. To that, weâve articulated that we will add the build ahead related to the footprint consolidation. And weâve really just begun on that build ahead. We only did about $3 million in Q3. We expect that to be about 10 in Q4. So what you are not going to see is any whipsaw impact of that inventory. That inventory has been put in place to last over several quarters and a good bit of that inventory is actually not internally produced.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird

Your view of selling versus the sell through in Q4?
Mark Thompson

So what weâve stated in our guidance is that we intend to keep the channel constant or reduced in dollars. So thatâs reflected in our guidance, so we obviously have some trends and models for point-of-sale and so we are making sell or we are stipulating that sell and we will be no greater than point-of-sale and put some buyers toward production.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we will hear next from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned a bit of caution as you look at Q4? So if you were to eliminate the impact of profit specific, the model and the customers? Is your guidance seasonal or below seasonal and if it is seasonal then how are you reflecting that cautiousness in your outlook?
Mark Thompson
So, the -- yeah, seasonal has a certain range associated with it. And so itâs -- we arenât seeing, what I describe is, caution is something that seasonal or maybe slightly more pronounced than seasonal. But no kind of standout things like you normally see. So I will give you a couple of interesting counterpoints.
So, we actually saw our direct customers pulling inventory more aggressively from like our cost that we maintain at the end of the third quarter. That is not a typical behavior associated with the broad base pullback.
So, I think, people are maintaining fairly low inventory. They maybe cleaning them up a bit. But we donât see anything that resembles a broad based correction or something like that. So, I think the contacts and the range of the caution, we would put at this juncture in the normal category for our fourth quarter.
Mark Frey
Yeah. Vivek, the other thing I would add is that, you noticed we opened the range up for the sales guidance as well. So we -- our lowest -- our lower levels or lower end point is a bit wider than we would normally do and that gives us that extra latitude to as Mark said to make sure that we can adjust shipments, so that our channel inventory and dollars is flat to down exiting the year.
We exit the year flat to down. We just donât bring any inventory overhangs into the New Year and that always works best for us. It is -- I am sure you know by looking our history, we typically have sales growth in the first quarter. So, what we are really trying to accomplish here is, whatever this correction is, try to contain it into the fourth quarter.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Got it. Got it. Itâs caution, itâs not the gloom and doom that microchip was suggesting. The second question I have is on the China customers in the mobile side? I think, you mentioned that, you havenât seen any specific impact? If you could give us some more color on whatâs happening in LTE, smartphone demand there? There was expectation that there would be somewhat of a pause in Q3 has the business resumed in Q4 and have you seen any big deviations on, what the best could be relative to say a quarter or two ago?
Mark Thompson
Yeah. So couple of things. We donât have that much exposure to the -- in dollar terms to the 4G build out of the infrastructure. So we are not terribly sensitive to that. On the handset side, so far we havenât seen something that would resemble an inventory correction. And so that would imply that there is probably reasonably equilibrium between what people are building and what the consumer is buying.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Got it. And then last one if I could sneak it in. Autos has very strong growth driver for you for many quarters, when do you think that cycle gets back to more normalized level, because when we, I understand that its more about unit content growth than unit growth? But what it is the right sort of normalized growth level we should think about for Fairchild in the automotive market? Thank you.
Mark Thompson
So, Mark, just commented earlier, what I regard as a planning horizon and for automotive a planning horizon is a couple of years. We see continued growth at the present rate and we are actually see the opportunity for even more growth than that. If you look at the basic trends of electrification of cars and I donât mean electric vehicle, I mean, electrifying parasitics, eliminating the idle circuit that you know have the stop-start function, mild hybrid, all those things are moving from unusual specialized things to mainstream. And they have not the square millimeters that powers all. And youâre talking square inches of -- sorry, I mixed my units of measures -- of silicon in these. So the content opportunities for automobiles for us in our strategy has really tremendous legs.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America
Thank you, Mark. Very helpful.
Operator
Next weâll hear from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse
Yeah. Good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Question for Mark Thompson. Mark, I wonder if you can just help me better understand the handset relative exposure, the large guy in Korea. Where are they sitting today? How much of that do you think is structural given your diversification elsewhere? And Iâd also be curious given that there is some speculation that that large customer might go from what has been a many SKU strategy down to a smaller set of SKUs. How do I think about your opportunity if that were to happen?
Mark Thompson
I mean, there is no question that they are in the middle of reexamining what their strategy is. And I think that certainly, if they were to shift, they will shift in a fewer SKUs and not more SKUs. I donât think there is either an opportunity or a challenge for us in that. I think the content will be roughly constant.
I also donât expect that they are going to experience things like we saw in the case of Nokia for example where they ruled from dominance to something close to irrelevance. I think what they are doing is seeing that competition in one of their big growth market is pretty tough. And they arenât going to realize the share that theyâve had in the past. That said, the products are very compelling.
I think their products will continue to be compelling. And I think they will remain a large shareholder. So I think from our point of view, I think this space is going to stabilize and inflect positively somewhere in the first half of next year. If you look at, where I think the share will stabilize, if I look at the platforms that are coming out. And so I think that will become where is itâs been a net challenge for us in 2013 and â14. I think in aggregate, it will become net positive for us in 2015.

Appreciate it, Mark. And then clearly, there is a lot of company specific drivers here, some on the plus side in autos, some this quarter on the negative side, handsets and gaming. But your 40 plus percent of the business is still industrial and appliance. And I guess, just given what weâre seeing in those end markets and especially some of the industrial companies that have reported here quarter today. Iâm a little bit surprise that you guys are viewing that market as just seasonal going into the December quarter. I guess, given the macro backdrop why not just a more conservative view on management business here and then wait for what is typically a seasonally stronger quarter than the March quarter?
Mark Thompson
I guess, yeah that you almost get into the philosophy of guidance on this stuff. So weâve never either added or subtracted what I regard as arbitrary amounts from the way we do our estimates. We look at some typical models including pullbacks right and severity of pullbacks and how orders might proceed across the quarter in Q4. Typically orders will weaken as we get to the end of the year, lot of vacation time is taken and so forth. So weâve modeled all of that. Weâve tried to model all of that into the reflection of our guidance.
Now, I canât -- maybe if I were a different semiconductor company, I could call the global economy based upon my incoming order rate. But weâre not that company. And so all we could do is call it the way we see it and put the data into our models and then manage the company. And thatâs really what weâre trying to do with the estimates that we put out. We truly believe that we will be within the range of the numbers that weâve guided.

Okay. Now, we are going to hear from Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Great. Thanks a lot guys. Mark, I just wanted to follow-up here on China specifically little bit. Obviously, we have Chinaâs golden week, the first week of the October month and we have that every year obviously but China is becoming more significant market. So just curios if that plays any role in some of the China caution you are expressing here and maybe itâs just going to halt during that week. Is that a factor here or is it just every year, so it doesnât really matter at this point?
Mark Thompson
Our observation of the golden event is, they shift demand around, they donât change demand and especially if one is early in the quarter and any negative affect from time off will be caught back up. I mean, the Chinese know as much as any culture. If there is demand out there, they will get it. And so they arenât going to take vacation and then miss an opportunity in the market. So, I think itâs factored into the extent that we can but I donât believe itâs impactful to the overall numbers.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Okay. If you think about appliances going into Q1 or just industrial overall, any reason why we wouldnât expect to see that typical pickup, has there been any Chinese subsidies that could be rolling off like weâve seen in the past or anything like that or if you right now anyway would have like you could have it closer to exit?
Mark Thompson
The subsidy environment in China is fairly neutral right now basically. So it doesnât -- itâs not changing but we can observe either, what people buy nor when they buy it. So weâve always seen strength in that phase in Q1 and certainly so far as we look at the order trends, we expect that to be a normal trend for us in 2015.
Mark Frey
I will just add. The appliance business is linked to the property business in China and thatâs one of the more areas of question marks in economy. So we havenât seen any really explosive signals there. Our senses are heightened to look for it.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Okay. Thatâs helpful.
Mark Frey
But seasonal, if few quarterâs a bit weak seasonal, would have Q1 to be stronger than Q4, not necessarily relative to previous Q1 of that. The trend of expecting industrial will be seasonally up in the first quarter is certainly our expectation.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
And if you could comment a little bit in terms of how your performance would be relative to overall unit sales? So for example, the SAR, globally itâs something like 80 million units and going a few percent a year. Is that dropped to 0% from 3%? We had a couple of points to come off peopleâs estimates on the overall SAR. How does that impact your growth? My sense is your growth is more dollar content if you are going to grow 12%. It all falls to 10% growth at some point?
Mark Frey
Yeah. I would say total unit growth is the minor component of the growth that we are going or pursuing. Itâs overwhelmingly content growth.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Okay. Great. And just last question, Mark, you and Mark Frey and Dan and rest of your have entered through a lot of cycles and economic changes. If you see something like major economy like Germany taking down their GDP growth forecast, how have youâve seen that play out sort of two quarters down the road? Clearly, you are getting orders you are today but less to see itâs something like that for an important economy. Is that closely typically a couple of quarters later for you or is it just real case-by-case?
Mark Thompson
I would say itâs really a case-by-case thing. If you look at -- if you use the examples that you gave of Germany, far and way our biggest business in Germany is the automotive Tier 1 and automotive Tier 1 are very global businesses. They sell into the U.S. market. They sell into the China market.
They even a little bit sell into the Japanese market. So, I think the challenge everybody has in all of these things is the economies are so interlinked that itâs really difficult to stay if a certain thing happens in one economy at some place, how does it ripple through?
And so I would say certainly at the risk of stating the obvious is in a micro lower growth economy that presents more challenges to the topline progress than growth in it. But itâs actually one of the reasons why, if you recall Steve, when we framed our strategy for improving the financial performance of the company, we said we didnât want to depend on growth. There is a reason for that, which is we my personally I happen to think that the global economy is a shaky challenging place and to have a strategy that depends on growth, unit growth is problematic. And so I think it really for us all of our strategies are about content growth and playing more important role to our key OEM customers.
And so again the comment as to a 1% or more of auto unit growth is perturbation to us, a 1% or more on global GDP should also be a perturbation to us. Obviously if a 2009ish event comes along, there is a -- that trumps all strategies basically for a period of time. But certainly as we stand here today I wouldnât predict that and I donât know anybody hat is.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Great. Thank you.
Mark Frey
The other thing I would say is that as you go through these periods of uncertainties, the most important thing you can do is to have short lead times and low inventory levels, right and be very responsive. So we are doing a better job this year than any year in our history. Our lead times never got that extended to this last year and that helped us to maintain a much clearer view of what the true demand was and not to be overstock in the channel.
So we are aiming at keeping inventories at a very mean level from already a quite mean level. There a very mean level going out of this year and giving ourselves latitude that even if things were to deteriorate, we still have the room within our guidance to not drag this thing into next year. And I think thatâs what you have to do to manage through these cycles.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James
Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

Kevin Cassidy with Stifel has our next question.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Thanks for taking my question. Along those lines, what is your backlog coverage right now compared to your guidance?
Mark Frey
Typical.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Okay. So the shorter lead times didnât change that.
Mark Frey
We have been short lead times now for four quarters. This is our fourth quarter of kind of 6-ish. So itâs within the model of what we would expect.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Okay. And just any other trends in the industry or any price pressures or is it just typical on that also?
Mark Frey
Pricing environment is normal I would say.
Mark Thompson
So within normal range of down 1% to 2%.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Okay. And maybe just one other on the automotive, do you work through a hub with the automotive companies or is there -- do they see the same lead times or is there an inventory build that they draw from?
Mark Thompson
Itâs a different model for each. In general, itâs a direct business. The car companies supply chains are good and quite stable. Once they set out to kit a car, we have a good visibility and the visibility is I guess far better than is required for our current lead times.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Okay, great. And do you think thatâs a cause of maybe things have been going along so well with short lead times that the biggest markets are more mature and are better supply chain than say when tablets were the high growth product?
Mark Thompson
Yeah. I mean, certainly there is -- to your point, there is fewer to prioritize who is the most volatile. I mean, there was a period of time in mobile, mobile and tablets at a high SKU accounts that were very, very difficult to keep up with. Probably the other end of the spectrum is automotive and industrial where typically the total production cycles times are long.
Our total dollar amounts are small relative to the total volume say of a car. And so I think we are able to get even good visibility in those settings. But thatâs more, the smaller customers which we have actually put a lot of time and energy into are somewhere in the middle, right. I mean a lot of these are companies with specialty products.
They might be doing unique power supply or something like that. Thatâs actually been a big focus area and short lead times for them are really fantastic, because a lot of them are -- they donât do -- have big volumes, they are not that plush, but they also canât drive top pricing either. So itâs a really nice space.
We have been growing it quite nicely with some of our sampling programs and so forth. And I think for them to have short lead times is a real positive. And so, I think weâve gotten more than our fair share of that space growth over the last year. And I think we will continue to do that. So I think itâs actually that medium to small customer in the middle range paying really good prices that almost the real sweet spot for our supply chain strategy.
Kevin Cassidy - Stifel
Okay.Great. Thank you.

We have one question left in the queue. We will hear from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research.

Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research
Hi. Good morning, everyone. A few clarifications. MCCC, will revenues be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter?
Mark Frey
It will be close.
Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research
Okay.
Mark Frey
I would say they would be down a little bit.
Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research
Okay. Very helpful. Second, with the buyback, could you just remind me few things? I think at the Analyst Day, you said a target of about a 118 million shares to exit the year. Is that still the target? And then second, just how much is left on the current authorization as well?
Mark Frey

You know between 118 and 120. We were 121.8 on the diluted calculation for Q3. That includes a timeline lag. So you automatically step down a bit in Q4, plus whatever we purchase in Q4. And as just Mark intimated, we probability will go above the average of the remaining run rate if the stock remains in the current range. We have$75 million thatâs left on the authorization.
Mark Thompson

We will be back in the market when the window opens. With that, I think tomorrow.
Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research
That is a follow-up. And then finally, just to make sure my math is clear, about $50 million from the two customers using MCCC, is that the right number to use?
Mark Thompson
Good estimate.
Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research
Okay, thanks so much. And congrats on the execution.
Mark Thompson
Thank you 
Dan Janson

Thanks, Shawn. Okay. With that, we will conclude the call today. Thank you for your interest in Dan Janson.
