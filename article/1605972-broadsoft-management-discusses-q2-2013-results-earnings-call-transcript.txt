Michael Tessler
Thanks, John. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the time to discuss our second quarter 2013 results.
I'm pleased to report we had a strong quarter, with good sales momentum worldwide, led by significant growth of both our hosted unified communications and SIP trunking products. We believe our performance is being driven by the growth and the adoption of unified communications as a result of an increasingly mobile workforce. Employees want the flexibility to determine when, where and how they work. Many studies show this freedom increases both creativity and productivity, and employees are leveraging multiple communication services and devices to stay connected when not in the office.
Forrester's 2013 Mobile Workforce Adoption Trends classified 29% of the global workforce as any time, anywhere information workers, up from 23% in 2011. These workers use 3 or more devices to stay connected and use multiple communications applications. The growth in mobile and dispersed workforces is driving enterprises to seek critical business tools, such as unified communications, that allow remote teams to easily collaborate and speed decision-making. Many in the industry believe that hosted unified communications is targeted to small and midsized business segment. However, we're seeing some of the most demanding and innovative large enterprises around the world looking to move their unified communications capabilities to the cloud, and these enterprises are looking to our service provider partners to deliver these solutions.
Let me share a couple of examples of how the breadth of our UC-One platform meets the need for mobile unified communications for larger enterprises and their employees. The first example is Telstra's recently announced Australian Department of Defense contract. Telstra will leverage our UC-One platform to deliver a comprehensive, unified communications solution to the Department of Defense that includes voice and video calling and conferencing, instant messaging and presence, web collaboration, fixed and mobile device support, as well as call center capabilities. The Australian Department of Defense required this complete unified communications solution to ensure its over 100,000 employees will be able to easily collaborate. We are seeing a lot of interest in comprehensive unified communications services by the public sector. We believe this market segment will be a good growth opportunity for us.
We are seeing strong demand for unified communication solutions across a broad range of private sector enterprises as well. However, most business lines today still terminate to a PBX. Our customers are leveraging our technology environment to develop and offer innovative, unified communications solutions for enterprises still using a PBX. These offers include enhanced SIP trunking capabilities, which connect an enterprise premise-based PBX to a broadband network to include video, web conferencing, instant messaging and presence, and mobility. These hybrid solutions integrate hosted seats and SIP trunking in order to allow enterprises to migrate to a fully-hosted unified communications solution over time. An example of this type of solution is a recently completed deployment of a hybrid hosted seat and SIP trunking solution for a large multinational enterprise by one of our Tier -- international Tier 1 customers. We first talked about this contract win in the second quarter of 2012. This enterprise has 60,000 employees in over 120 countries. Their requirements include lowering their communications cost by increasing on-net calling, mobile integration, as well as providing these capabilities to the employees who will initially remain on their existing PBXs. This innovative BroadSoft-powered solution was selected because of its scalability and flexibility in supporting their required combination of hosted and PBX seats, as well as our seamless mobile device integration.
Because of the significant benefits enterprises are experiencing internally, with their unified communications solutions, they are now looking to find ways to use unified communications to improve their communications with their customers, suppliers and business partners. We believe that recent industry standards work around WebRTC to significantly change the way companies communicate externally. In the second quarter, we introduced a WebRTC demonstration for our UC-One platform. WebRTC or Web Realtime Communications transforms Web browsers into an endpoint, extending voice and video communications beyond the confines of the enterprise to any customer, partner or supplier with access to a WebRTC-enabled browser. By integrating WebRTC into our UC-One platform, we will enable our service provider customers to offer enterprises, new customer service productivity and cost saving benefits.
An example of these benefits is when an enterprise adds WebRTC capabilities to its website. When a prospect is browsing a website and has a question, that visitor can simply click a link and communicate through their web browser, by voice or video, with a company representative, which will help eliminate friction in the buying decision process. With the addition of WebRTC, UC-One will further break down silos that have been erected around voice, video and collaboration that inhibit employee productivity by extending UC benefits to an enterprise's entire ecosystem.
So, to summarize, we had a very good quarter driven by strong revenue results from our global customer base for our hosted unified communications and SIP trunking services, and we continue to make strategic R&D investments in our UC-One platform to ensure the growth of unified communications services by our global service provider customers.
A little later, I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have, but now I'll turn the call over to Jim, who will go over the financial results and our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Jim?
James A. Tholen
Thanks, Mike. I'd like to start by providing some of the key financial highlights for the second quarter.
Total revenue was $44 million, up 9% from a year ago. Software license revenue was $24.7 million, up 10% year-over-year. Subscription and maintenance support revenue was $16.3 million, up 18% year-over-year. Professional services and other revenue was $3 million, down 29% year-over-year. Billings, which we define as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, was $45.4 million, up 20% year-over-year. Software license billing growth was 25% year-over-year.
On a geographic basis, we saw strong software license billing growth in all major geographies. Orders from existing customers contributed 96% of total software billings. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.32. Cash flow from operations was $3.5 million. From a software perspective, we had a very strong enterprise billings quarter, fueled by both our Hosted Unified Communications and our SIP trunking businesses. On Hosted, the demand was broad-based.
We saw strength in traditional hosted voice and are also seeing more and more demand for our broader unified communications applications. We are seeing increased demand for our mobile oriented solutions, especially in Europe. These are both mobile-centric as well as fixed mobile convergent applications. We also benefited from end user demand across the size of enterprise spectrum, from the small end of SMB up to some of the very largest enterprise opportunities, as Mike discussed.
On a geographic basis, the Hosted UC growth this quarter was led by Europe and Asia.
Regarding our SIP trunking business, as we'd noted last quarter, we believe our service provider customers continue to see strong end-user SIP trunking demand, and the Q2 billings results reflected that, with particular strength in North America and Europe. So, a little early to call the Q2 uptick a trend, but we're certainly encouraged by the results. Our Q2 customer billings results remain consistent with our expectation that business will represent about 10% of full year 2013 results.
Results for our maintenance and subscription support business were in line with our expectation. Cloud revenue was approximately 5% to 6% of total revenue for Q2.
In our professional services business, revenue was relatively in line as well. PS billings were greater than revenue for the quarter and for the first 6 months, and we expect that trend to hold for the full year results as we continue to execute on several longer-term projects that we expect will be recognized as revenue in 2014.
Now I'd like to provide a little more detail on the cost side. Our gross margin was 82% with software license gross margin at 94%, subscription and maintenance support gross margin at 78%, and professional services and other gross margin at 14%. For us, license gross margin is scale-related, so growth and license revenue helps drive margin expansion. For subscription and maintenance support, we continue to balance support margin growth with BroadCloud investment. Finally, our professional services and other margins were impacted by increased headcount associated with specific customer engagements for which we have not yet recognized revenue.
We achieved operating income of $9.7 million in Q2, resulting in an operating margin of 22%. Operating expense was $26.6 million, up 14% year-over-year. This level of operating expense was a little lower than we had forecasted but we expect to remain aggressive in our investments to drive future growth. As we talked about last quarter, we are increasingly seeing opportunities to accelerate our investment in our cloud solutions, and believe that doing so will be NPV positive for us. Specifically, we're looking to add headcount to accelerate our prosecution of our BroadCloud PBX pipeline.
On the balance sheet, net cash, cash equivalents and investment were $206.7 million at quarter end. We had strong billings in the quarter and had several large deals close near the end of the quarter, which caused accounts receivable to grow to $49.3 million, up $7.2 million sequentially. Total deferred revenue was $61 million, up $1.4 million sequentially.
I now want to provide an update on the large contract win that we talked about on previous earnings conference calls. In Q3 of 2012, we noted a win with an existing customer for a new large project that contributed the significant majority of a $10-million increase to our long-term deferred revenue balance. There have been positive additions to that deal we wanted to highlight. Most importantly, our customer ordered BroadCloud UC capabilities, specifically instant messaging presence, web collaboration, video conferencing and mobility. This has helped increase the size of the project and we now expect it to generate over $15 million in 2014, about $10 million of which we expect in the first half of 2014 and the remainder, ratably, over the rest of that year. We also believe we have a great opportunity for additional significant revenue post 2014. I think it is at least reasonably probable we will see $3 million to $4 million or more per year for several years, and perhaps most strategically, the fact that our UC functionality is a key part of this major win is great validation of our product and technology direction.
Now I would like to provide guidance for the third quarter and full year 2013. For Q3 2013, we expect to deliver revenue in the $42 million to $46 million range. We also expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.23 to $0.33 per share. For the full year 2013, we expect revenue in the $181 million to $186 million range. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.40 per share.
While we did bring down the top end of our 2013 revenue guidance, we remain very bullish on the underlying growth opportunities for us, and we reiterate our view that our underlying market has long-term growth rates in excess of 20%, and that we expect to maintain or expand our market share. We think we go into 2014 with strong underlying growth in our core software business, especially with regard to Hosted Unified Communications and accelerating growth of our BroadCloud PBX business.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, can you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Notter of Jefferies.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask about, I think you mentioned it earlier, bringing the high end of the guidance down a bit. Is there something to that, relative to what you were expecting previously? Is it the consumer business? Is it lumpiness in professional services? Is it something about the Hosted or SIP trunking business? Any insights there would be helpful.
Michael Tessler
No, George. I mean, I think it's just we're getting closer to year end, so visibility increases and we were able to narrow the range a little bit. I think we feel really good about the business. Certainly, the Hosted business, SIP trunking has renewed momentum. I think we continue to work off the consumer downturn and the PS downturn. So I think it's just a little bit of added precision as we get through the year.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got it, okay. I guess, as I think about that, I mean, the precision is negative relative to what you were expecting, and I understand that you have more visibility and we're drifting in towards year end. But I guess my question presumes that, at some point, you were expecting maybe some additional business, additional contracts. I guess I'm just trying to push back a little bit on why you're taking the guidance down a touch from where it was previously.
Michael Tessler
Yes. I mean, no, not really. I mean, again, the low-end stays the same, Q2 came in a bit nicely. Clearly, we're forecasting Q3 a little bit below where The Street had us. But, I mean, I think the bottom's up. The tone of the business, the strength of the business remains strong. I don't think there was anything particularly negative about the business that had us bring it down.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got it, okay. And then I wanted to ask -- also, you guys talked about this, I think, more in the last few months. But you had a number of FMC types of projects going on in Europe. It sounds like those are getting more traction. Can you talk about those and can you give us a sense for how big those are as a percentage of the overall revenue stream now?
James A. Tholen
Sure, George. What we're seeing is a trend I talked about on a previous call, around really bringing together the concept of a single subscription for both fixed and mobile. So, as a business owner, I really need to really buy a single subscription for every employee instead of buying a mobile on a PBX extension or work-at-home number, et cetera, and really bringing them all together into a single subscription. Not only providing voice but also, now, providing a full UC stack, and instant messaging and presence, and sharing, and collaboration, and audio conferencing and videoconferencing. And so that's really the essence of what these offers that we're seeing in Europe roll out. The ones that we have rolled out in 2013 have done extremely well from kind of a launch to the marketplace. We have lots of experience, obviously, with lots of service providers on how fast that occurs. And I think what we're seeing, with those launches that have a very high mobile concentration or mobile content, that they're moving extremely quickly in the market, that their offers are being well understood. There's lots of value to those offers because there's a combination of both cost savings and additional feature functionality. They're well-understood by the business buyer. So we're seeing some really good opportunity around that. We think we'll see more of that as more and more service providers kind of copy that formula that we've seen in a number of market launches in 2013. I think -- Jim, I don't know, on a percentage of revenue, it'd be kind of -- probably have to have a certain amount of -- it'd be kind of hard...
Michael Tessler
Yes, a little bit hard, only because so many of our projects have some degree of mobility in them now, I mean, I think it's just an important part of where the business has evolved.
I think that proportion's higher in Europe and we're seeing really strong Hosted growth in Europe. But I think it's hard to nail a percentage.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Got it, great. And then the upward revision in earnings for the full year, I was just trying to understand what's kind of behind that. Is that a function of not being able to spend on some of these new opportunities, like BroadCloud or hosted PBX, as quickly as you wanted to or is there something else at play I'm missing?
Michael Tessler
Yes, well, part of it is just the Q2 beat, and we didn't take the full beat into the annual increase. We kind of want to give ourselves some operating leverage to continue to invest. But it was really just rolling through some of the Q2 beat.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I think your EMEA revenue was down year-on-year, and I think you partly cited some deals that had to be deferred, that didn't meet all of the recognition criteria in the quarter. Is that what drove the increase in the long-term deferred?
Michael Tessler
So, I guess, the quick question is -- no, the European move into deferred was in current. The long-term was really that large project that I talked about. When we added the unified communications capabilities and significantly increased the size of that contract, the revenue recognition changed from kind of traditional software rev rec on the software piece to more ratable, and so it just had the impact of moving a couple of million dollars, that had been in current, back into long.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. Did that impact this year's guidance at all?
James A. Tholen
No. No, because we had always expected that to be revenue in 2014, and we continue to expect that to be 2014 revenue.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Sure, okay. And then it seemed that, in the U.S., more of the growth was driven by SIP trunking this quarter as opposed to Hosted. Did Hosted actually grow in the U.S.? And, from a BroadSoft perspective, it seems that the economics to you guys are actually more attractive on a per seed basis, in Hosted as opposed to SIP trunking. So how do you view this trend? Is that something that you should be concerned about, longer-term, from a mix perspective?
Michael Tessler
Sure, yes. So, yes, it grew. It just didn't grow as much. And I think, Simona, that North America had a very, very significant Hosted Q1. It was a little more heavily weighted SIP trunking in Q2, but so I think strong. And, no, I don't think there's any negative trend, in terms of North American Hosted, at all. But you're absolutely correct, on a per line basis, Hosted is definitely more remunerative for us.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And then just a couple of quick ones. BroadCloud, are you still on track to exit the year about 9% of revenue?
Michael Tessler
Yes, so it's kind of interesting. Yes, we said 8% to 9%, and especially given where we think Q4 is going to come in, we're just seeing, overall, pretty significant growth. We may not quite get there on an exit basis, certainly, for the quarter. I certainly expect us to be in that range in Q1 of 2014. So it's a little bit of the SaaS revenue takes a bit of time to build up. We're looking at a big Q4 right now, just generally. So we have, in some sense, a denominator problem. But I think somewhere between Q4 and Q1 we'll absolutely be in that 9% range.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Okay. And so then, perhaps, that 1 percentage point is what explains the slight downtick in the top line of the revenue guidance. Would that be a fair way to look at it?
Michael Tessler
No, I just -- yes, maybe a little bit. Yes. I mean, the cloud, it continues to grow for us. But, as we've gotten closer in, we've taken it down just a little bit. I think that's fair.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Co.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Just wanted to follow-up on comments from last quarter, when you talked about potentially making a decision to invest more heavily in your go-to-market, which seems like it had been quite successful up to this point. Where do you stand on that? And it sounds like your investment, going forward, is investment in BroadCloud. And I'm not sure if that's go-to-market investment in BroadCloud or what exactly that is. So if could you just clarify sort of where we stand with respect to this plan.
Michael Tessler
Sure. Yes, let me...
James A. Tholen
Yes, I'll talk about the kind of financials part of that and then have Mike give you a broader view of some of the initiatives underway on go-to-market. Yes, so last quarter we talked about investments in go-to-market and in cloud. And just for clarity, go-to-market is a broader investment by us in helping our service provider customers drive their hosted growth, whether it's software or a cloud. And then, on cloud, it's really driving the implementation of the pipeline in several of these carriers that we're in process with. And one of the key things is we said, we're going to do both levels of investment within our guidance range. So it's not investment outside of guidance range. And both continue. We emphasized cloud this quarter and that is a key focus. But we're putting more resources into go-to-market with our service providers, because it has been helpful and we can see that in the growth of the Hosted business. I don't know, Mike, if you wanted to add to that.
Michael Tessler
Yes, just a little bit of color on the content of what we call go-to-market. I often think about it in kind of 3 chunks. The first one is the kind of consultancy work we do with our service provider customers around helping them launch the product, package it, pricing. Anything to do with kind of coming in and really helping them figure out how to build channels, how to go to market, how to bring the service-through-the-channel to market. So there's quite a bit of activity around that. And that's, as Jim mentioned, both for BroadCloud customers or traditional BroadWorks customers. The second chunk, we have a number of programs we're working with those customers on, in terms of lead generation and sales incentives, those kinds of things. And then the third is, for specific customers, we have kind of added additional sales support, sales engineering support, being able to respond to RFPs. So all things that -- really working with them in the channel for the kind of deals that I described on the call, that are quite complex, that require BroadSoft expertise to be in there, really helping those service providers kind of win those deals, being able to kind of tune the offers to be very kind of effective. Both from a feature functionality standpoint but also from an overall TCO so we can win against the competition. So those are the 3 chunks that we're investing in. We can invest this year, we'll continue to grow that investment into next year.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division
Great, that's helpful color. And then just if I could follow-up on the Voice over LTE, you didn't mention it in your prepared remarks today. I think you've been describing that as a 2014 opportunity. Can you give us any updates on that? And in particular, kind of the consumer side of it, where there's some stuff that has happened and you guys haven't been part of it. Do you still see that as an opportunity as we head into '14?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I think the perspective around Voice over LTE continues to be the same. We're seeing that as being a '14 opportunity. Frankly, on the consumer side, we're seeing lots of rollouts, perhaps even slip out of '14 into '15 as, generally, both the technology and the kind of the rollout of those capabilities are taking longer than expected. And we've been pretty cautious about trying to build a consumer Voice over LTE into the program. Because one of the other things is around consumer loyalty is that this is really kind of an optimization gain for the service providers. Very few are in a rush to make that happen and they really want to get it right. So because it's more of a cost optimization, not a new revenue opportunity, they're being fairly cautious and we might see those rollouts continue. We've committed to feel pretty good about opportunities in '14. And, really, one of the areas we've talked about and we have really good conversations with our carriers is around the enterprise side of Voice over LTE, as the discussions we're having with a lot of operators is how they could potentially use their significant rollouts of LTE to launch kind of new range of unified communications services, and that's clearly a place that we have a very, very significant competitive advantage. We're really the only incredible TAS vendor, application server vendor for enterprises, and really could be a really interesting entry point for us for a number of Voice over LTE build-outs around the world. So I think, to sum up, we're really seeing the picture similar as I described in the last call, that's why we didn't really highlight it, our conversations, our work in terms of working through a number of lab situations and RFPs continue, and we feel pretty comfortable with our position there.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
A little bit on the large contract that got upsized next year. Certainly, sounds like UC is working there, a $10 million deal upsized to $15 million. My question is, you announced and landed that contract, I think, in Q3 of 2012, are there other large opportunities out there of that magnitude or would you characterize that as kind of more of an anomaly? Just trying to frame -- you've been working on this large deal for a while, it's now being upsized. Are there other big opportunities out there? And, if so, are those near-term, longer-term opportunities? How should we think about the pipeline of large deals out there for BroadSoft?
Michael Tessler
Yes. I mean, I think, first of all, the answer is yes. We are working a number of deals, kind of the largest -- large could be anything, a few thousand seats and above, to very large, hundreds of thousands. I think what we're seeing is those deals, generally, just like anything of that magnitude, are fairly lengthy sales processes. They have RFPs, they go through quite a bit of up sales activity. And so we actually have pretty good visibility, we've seen quite a few of those deals in the hopper. I think the proposition that we're going to market with, very mobile-centric, not only works for the very small enterprises, but really, is quite interesting when you really kind of scale up and think about the fact that enterprises today, and many enterprises, are buying thousands and thousands of mobile subscriptions, and thousands and thousands of PBX extensions, and paying for lots and lots of people to be able to have a phone at home or some other location. So there's a tremendous amount of cost savings that are incurred by bringing all of these together in these FMC solutions. So we believe that these network-centric solutions, that we're powering our service providers to go to market with, are very competitive against traditional PBX solutions that really are missing this really tight mobile integration that we're bringing to market. I think the second element that I highlighted in the script is the ability for us to be able to deliver these networks and integrate with existing PBXs and existing infrastructure, be able to have a very open environment, be able to use all kinds of phones and gateways, and so on, allows us to significantly reduce the cost of the solutions. So, again, an important element. We can bring all of the unified communications capabilities to the marketplace at a much, much lower TCO than the competition. And that's one of the reasons why I think a lot of the operators that we're working with today are starting to kind of get really excited by using the BroadWorks technology inside these really large enterprise opportunities.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
So would you say that sales cycle process for these larger deals -- is it actually just kind of log jammed, right now, to some extent? Is it kind of status quo and it's been just a long lead time or is there sign it's actually getting harder to push some of those larger deals to the close?
Michael Tessler
No, I think the process is actually picking up, as the enterprises are starting to look at cloud as a really viable offer. I think our service provider customers are getting more comfortable quoting and bidding these very large opportunities. I think it's quite a big change from deploying hundreds of PBXs for these large enterprises, these very large cloud deployment models. I mean, they're getting more comfortable with that capability. I think our investment in go-to-market is helping our service providers to be able to be more effective in responding to those. Clearly, you understand, we can't -- don't have the ability to kind of tell on every one of those pipeline deals as they're pretty -- our service provider customers are pretty careful of not wanting us to talk about those larger price deals. We hope to be able to talk about more about them next call.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. Well, helpful color. And then, Jim, a question for you on OpEx, as you think about the deal that you're upsizing here for next year. Do you expect to incur some additional cost for that additional $5 million in revenue on that large deal in Q4, such that maybe you don't get the same amount of operating leverage that we typically see in a Q4 or should we still think about a more normal seasonal leverage in the model as we go into kind of Q4?
James A. Tholen
Yes. No, I think you'll see -- I think it's the latter, Brent. We had the cost associated with that project pretty baked into the guidance, and I think you'll see operating expense, in Q4, in the $30 million range, plus or minus, and so it's in there.
Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay, perfect. My last question. I know Mike mentioned mobile a couple of times. You talked about mobile in the script. Is that becoming a material part of the revenue, where you're starting to break-out the mobile contribution? Not necessarily just VoLTE, but 4G, 3G kind of mobile UC or is it still real early days?
James A. Tholen
Well, it's a mix. I mean, it's early days but it's also a continuum. More and more, even of our kind of traditional voice hosted customers, are adding UC, adding mobility. And so it's everything, from just simultaneous ring to full-on UC clients. So I just think it's less separating it out and more -- it's just part of the continuum of Hosted.

Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Netis of William Blair and Company.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Wanted to get more color on this large deal. I think the estimates were originally given that $8 million -- just, Jim, if you could clarify. I think there were a couple of deals in that third quarter '12 number that made it to $10 million. But that particular deal, I think, was closer to $8 million, and so that would mean that you're actually upsizing it to about $7 million additional revenue. So that's one. If you could clarify that. And then the second piece. I think it was also, if my memory serves me right, a BroadWorks deal, and now you're incorporating some BroadCloud in there as well. And so, can you talk about where one is being used over the other or what's the dynamic there that the customer had decided to kind of either use one or the other or both in this case? And then, finally, on this $3 million to $4 million upside that you see past 2014, if you could just give more clarity in those comments. Is that subscription revenue that you see sort of flowing into the P&L after 2014?
James A. Tholen
Sure, okay, yes. So, the answer is it's -- I guess the quick answer is it's both. So, you're right, it was a little north -- the software number in Q3 2013 was a little north of $8 million. There are two drivers for that being upsized now. One is that $8-plus million was software-only. We noted, at the time, there's also a couple of million -- or up more than $1 million worth of professional services associated with that. It's actually a couple of million dollars plus, and it wasn't in that software number. And then, as you said, as we noted in today's prepared remarks, the customer also has now committed to a set of BroadCloud features, unified communication features, and it's really the total UC package. So, it's BroadWorks software hosted plus mobility, plus Instant message and presence, plus web collaboration, plus video calling, videoconferencing. So it's actually all additive. It wasn't deciding, just to be clear, when we say BroadCloud, it's not BroadCloud PBX. It's BroadWorks Hosted. But it's the rest of the Unified Communications suite for this end customer. And then your final question on post 2014, it's a combination of subscription revenue -- software revenue, subscription revenue, maintenance revenue and professional services, that I think the net's $3 million to $4 million-plus. But most of that we would expect to be subscription revenue.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. And so I guess the key point is the BroadCloud PBX isn't a part of this deal, it's really the UCPs. So the BroadWorks plus the UC features like instant messaging and mobility, e-project and so forth? Okay.
James A. Tholen
Yes, it's absolutely correct.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. That makes sense -- total sense. And then one for Mike. Mike, I just want to dig in to this comment you made last quarter, on the BroadCloud being sort of offered as a Over-The-Top offering and some of the customers or carriers are allowing just bring your own bandwidth capability. Can you give us a sense of what your go-to-market, in that strategy, in this case would be? Because I would think that this -- everything that's over-the-top is not something that carriers would love to offer, right? It kind of defeats their core value proposition. So just trying to get a sense of how you go to market in this as over-the-top and bring your own bandwidth opportunity with your carriers or without the carriers if you do decide to go direct.
Michael Tessler
Okay, I'm trying to answer that. So I think what I meant by over-the-top was really -- make sure we're clear. We're always powering the service provider. We're not going to market directly. So I don't know if that was a bit of confusion. And what we have seen a number of operators talk about is the idea of not bundling in -- one consequence [ph] of over-the-top is not bundling in broadband access. So, in fact, going-to-market, providing hosted PBX or hosted UC over anybody's broadband. And we have the capabilities to be able to deliver that, support it, deliver that service, even if a broadband isn't, in fact, ordered from that service provider. So that's, really, one of the concepts around over-the-top. The other over-the-top, meaning that they in fact use this white label service, called Wildcard PBX, and basically kind of over-the-top their own operations by basically coming to us and having us run the complete service capability. So it really depends on your definition of the concept of over-the-top. In the first case, why would search providers want to do that? Well, they may want to have a different offering that doesn't include broadband to be competitive with other over-the-top providers. Clearly, in an over-the-top environment, where you're not required to bring broadband, you can, in fact, deliver service in days versus weeks or months. So there's a time-to-market capability from an end-user perspective that some operators are looking at. There's also just a complexity reduction of saying, hey, I can sell broadband or I can sell hosted unified communications. But I'm not going to, basically, bundle those in from an operations standpoint. I'm going to separate them and I'm really going to kind of run those 2 businesses a little bit separate and so that, in fact, I've reduce the overall engineering operations and IT complexity that some of the service providers have. So those are a number of reasons why some of the search providers that we're talking to are intrigued by an over-the-top service. Talking about broad -- just to be clear, our BroadWorks PBX offer can be bundled without broadband, it doesn't have to be an over-the-top. My comment was that a number of service providers are looking at an over-the-top service that'd augment some of the things that are doing. Be able to go to market quicker, to be able to compete with some of the competitors more effectively than they have traditionally.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. So the strategy is still to white-label the product and not go direct or bypass your key carrier customer, obviously, right?
Michael Tessler
Absolutely. We've been very clear that the service providers are our strategic go-to-market partner. We need to invest in those partners. As Jim and I talked about earlier in the call, in terms of our go-to-market strategy, we're really about leveraging that channel and allowing the service providers to put their brand on it. That's really how we -- differentiates us in the service provider community, and making those strategic partners really successful in the marketplace. So, yes, our strategy continues to be through the service provider.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Great. Okay. And then the VARs and system integrators...
John Kiang
I apologize we're running out of time, so can we continue the queue and we'll take this off-line?

Our next question comes from the line of Catharine Trebnick of Northland Securities.
Catharine Anne Trebnick - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division
I actually am going to follow-up, I think, on what Dmitry was going to ask because I was going to ask the same thing. Mike, last quarter you said that you had some new resellers as customers. I mean, has that picked up at all? How much would you say you're focusing on the reseller community like the arrow 3s [ph], et cetera? And then I have one housekeeping question. What was the existing sales this quarter? Last quarter it was 96% of sales.
Michael Tessler
Sorry, Catharine. I'm not sure I understood the second question. Jim did you...
James A. Tholen
I'll do the second.
Michael Tessler
So I think what -- on BroadCloud PBX, just to answer that part of it -- I think one of the things we're seeing is the interest is predominantly in the very large Tier 1 operators. And as I described, really, the ability for those operators to launch a unified communications service quickly, without the kind of internal build that would be required, from -- both from a network engineering perspective but also from an IT perspective, all the business processes that would be required. So, clearly, the biggest opportunity that we've seen, and that we continue to be quite interested in, is in the larger operators. Those operators that may have launched a BroadWorks-based service in a segment and have decided to watch another segment that realize that they're late to market or they want to go to market more quickly and that they'll leverage our white label service to be able to go to market more quickly, be able to cut through the very long IT build cycle that they have. So, more and more, I'd say that our focus is shifting to those Tier 1 operators. Clearly, the BroadCloud PBX service has interest to others that, I would say, on the other end of the spectrum, that don't have any infrastructure, aren't traditional operators -- -- traditional network operators. We signed up a couple of those, more and more of our focus is on our traditional Tier 1 carrier customers that really see a huge advantage in being able to leverage our white label service for the full UC stack.
James A. Tholen
And then, Catharine, I think your second question was the proportion of software revenue that came from existing versus new customers. And it was similar, 96%.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
First, I was hoping to go back to the guidance. Because if I do my math correct and assume you come in to midpoint or even high-end of your Q3 revenue forecast, it seems like you'll need to deliver more than 20% sequential growth in Q4 just to get to the low end of your full-year revenue forecast. So, given that backdrop, I'd be curious to understand what's giving you confidence you can achieve a very strong Q4, there are large deals in the balance sheet that are giving you a little bit more visibility that are bolstering your confidence on the full year outlook.
James A. Tholen
Sure, yes. First off, when we do guidance, we're really doing it kind of from the core business out, not -- kind of not looking at macro. Certainly, we'll sanity check it on kind of the sort of macro or high level trend. And, look, it's a bunch of stuff. One, the hosted business, we can see it accelerating, we can see the tread lines with our customers. Two, our sense is that it's actually going to be a pretty reasonable budget-buying Q4. Last Q4 was not as robust, relatively speaking, and we think this one will be. Third is the SIP trunking business, it was down over the last several quarters or was wider, relatively speaking, over the last several quarter until this quarter, and we think Q4 will be a pretty strong Q4. And then, finally, we'll work through kind of this diminishment of consumers. So, you actually see some of the consumer going down, that's masked the Hosted growth, just less of.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
So more of a bet on broad-based trends improving through the second half rather than any large deals coming in, in Q4?
James A. Tholen
Well, yes. I mean, it's both. I mean, it's always a mix and we certainly -- I'd say there are no unusually large deals. But, again, we tend to see more and bigger seven-figure deals in Q4 than we do in other quarters, just because we see more deal flow.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And then maybe just following up on some of the questions regarding the incremental go-to-market in the second half of the year. Can you help us understand how you're going to balance the need to invest versus growth and profitability? And to what extent would you be willing to pull back on spending to reach your full year margin guidance if revenue was to come in a little bit wider than expected or towards the lower end of your target range?
James A. Tholen
So, I mean, those are some -- that's a pretty tough objective. I mean, I think our plan is to be -- we're planning on delivering the business within the guidance range, and that's a set of investment that is really driving 2014 growth. So, that's the plan, that's in the guidance. I'd rather not speculate on what we would do if we're either below or above the guidance.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And then just a couple of last housekeeping items. But can you tell us what BroadCloud and the Consumer business were as a percentage of sales this quarter and giving us the revenue split from Tier 1s?
Michael Tessler
Yes. So, let's see. As we said on the call, BroadCloud was 5% to 6%. The Tier 1 business was kind of in the -- was about 40%. And I'm sorry, your last question?
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
The Consumer business, what percentage of revenue that is now?
James A. Tholen
Yes. So what we said in the remarks is that we expect Consumer to be 10% for the year. We guided to that at the beginning of the year, and we're tracking to that. It was a reasonable Consumer quarter, but that'll shake out as 10%.
Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
But above 10% this quarter?
James A. Tholen
Yes, maybe a little bit.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Modoff of Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Vijay Bhagavath on behalf of Brian. Jim, a two-part question if I may. The first is, what visibility do you have into the back half, now that you've taken down the high end of your full-year guidance? I'd like to better understand your visibility from your service provider customers.
James A. Tholen
Yes. So, Vijay, I mean, it's sort of the same it's always been. I think for selling big BT software to telecom providers it's a reasonably forecastable model. So I know that's caveated, but it's a success-based CapEx model for the carriers, and as they sell more, they come back and buy more from us, and Q4 tend to accentuate that trend. And I think with sort of a moderate to benign CapEx environment, we expect we'll see a little bit more budget buying. But, it's really, the visibility is, as software for the go-to [ph], I think, pretty decent.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes. And the second part is more of a strategy question, Jim. Heading into next year, what should we think of the next phase growth driver for the company? Would it be around BroadCloud? Would it be some inorganic, like an M&A strategy you'd execute to next year or would it just be kind of extending the core business around hosted enterprise UC?
James A. Tholen
Sure. Yes, as we've said in the prepared remarks, I think 2014, the key drivers for growth will be our underlying software business, particularly on hosted unified communications. I think there's a lot of organic growth opportunity there. And, again, the Consumer will be down to 10% of revenue, so that'll be less of a drag. And then, two, is I think the BroadCloud business, particularly the BroadCloud PBX, will become more and more meaningful for us. So I think both are the big growth drivers.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Yes. And then a final question if I may. Competitive dynamics versus Cisco, in hosted enterprise voice over IP UC, especially in the larger enterprises. Any sign of design win losses versus Cisco?
Michael Tessler
Vijay, it's Mike. I'll take that. I mean, we continue to see, really, strong positioning in the service provider side, using our technology. So, generally, what we're seeing is the service providers main offer to market on the hosted unified communications side is a fully carrier-branded solution powered by BroadSoft. And we're starting to see those solutions in more segments, from small to medium to large, and as I described in the remarks, to what I call the very large, the multinationals that we're starting to get a bid into. A number of service providers have or are trying to build Cisco-based solution. These solutions are typically there for when an enterprise really asks for a full end-to-end Cisco solution, and those service providers don't want to lose those opportunities and so they've built more works to build those kind of end-to-end Cisco solutions. Frankly, we haven't seen a tremendous amount of momentum. I think, you guys, if you check the market and talk to our set of [ph] customers, realize those offers are pretty expensive, they're pretty close, and that the number of seats being sold are quite small. And, frankly, the revenue and sort of the margin for the service provider for those Cisco seats are not very strong. And so we're not seeing a lot of momentum in the Cisco solutions at all through our carrier customers.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt of Raymond James.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
It's Tavis. Just had a question on the stock compensation. It looks like it's been up pretty significantly the last couple of quarters and almost 3x year-over-year. And what I'm wondering is, have you changed the compensation structure of your employees or is there a changes in some of the accounting or volatility measures that affect that? And should we expect this to be the run rate going forward?
Michael Tessler
Sure. So, as you might have seen in February of this year, the company did a pretty sizable equity grant, and what we said publicly is we accelerated what we, historically, might have done annually into this year, just to drive more equity ownership in the company, and it was a strategic move by our board. And the way that the accounting manifests itself is you end up getting kind of a front-end loaded hit when you do that from a stock comp. Now, we manage the business on a non-GAAP cash basis. We guide on non-GAAP, so we don't really guide on stock comp. But I guess my general comment would be, just the way, the accounting works, that you'd see some diminution of that amount after this year.
Operator
We have no further questions in queue. Sir, I'll turn the call back to you for closing remarks.
