Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to The Valspar's Fiscal 2015 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead.
Bill Seymour
Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.
Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.
Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-K. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.
As we discussed this year, fiscal 2015 reported results include the impact of both foreign currency translation and the 53rd week. The 53rd week occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 and was included in our North America results. Today's material includes commentary on constant currency growth rate and the estimated performance excluding the 53rd week for comparable time period. Management believes this is a helpful way for our investors to evaluate the underlying performance of Valspar. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.
Gary Hendrickson
Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us. Our fourth quarter wrapped up a very good 2015 which resulted in record earnings for Valspar. I am very pleased with our performance especially in light of the headwinds we faced. When I evaluate our performance, I do it in context of our underlying or core business. Using this lens, our annual sales increased 4% in 2015, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, the 53rd week and the change at Lowe's. This outcome is very much in line with the organic growth rate we've enjoyed in the past. Our profitability was also strong for the year. Our adjusted EPS increased 6% and finished at the high end of our guidance for the year. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, EPS increased 11%. This performance shows the strength of our diversified business portfolio and Valspar's operating model. We are executing well on the things that we can control, we are winning new business and achieving significant productivity. 
New business wins have contributed about 4% a year to our growth over the last several years and growing faster than the market will continue to be a key driver for us in 2016. 
Let's look at a few highlights from Coatings and Paints from the year. Our Coatings segment had another solid year especially in the context of a modest aggregate decline in our end market. We overcame this by driving new business wins and grew volume in sales 3% excluding FX and the 53rd week. On the same measure, everyone of our coatings product line grew sale in the year. As a reminder, we are comparing against an exceptional year of double digit growth in 2014. And importantly our Coatings EBIT margins were up 160 basis points in 2015. Within coatings, general industrial volume was up double digits for the year, in packaging coatings the significant investments we've made over the past decade to commercialize non-BPA coatings for our customers are paying off. In 2015, we grew our non-BPA product portfolio strong double digits. Today, our non-BPA market share is by far the highest in the industry and is higher than our overall share in the global packaging market. 
Our coil product line has been a strong performer over the last several years and 2015 was no exception. We grew our business in all geographies with the especially strong growth in the Americas. 
In summary, our coatings business had another notable year and continues to lead the industry in growth and financial performance. By leveraging our world class technology and best in class service model to help customers succeed in their market, we are very well positioned to continue this leadership into the future. 
Turning now to our Paint segment. As you know, over the last several years we've transformed our consumer paint business. We are growing our brands globally and investing in-store service to support great partnerships like Lowe's. We've also developed new retail partnerships with Ace, B&Q, Masters and Mitre 10 New Zealand. We have introduced industry leading innovative products like Valspar Reserve; the number one rated zero VOC paint in the US. Last year our core paint segment volumes and sales were up 5% excluding FX, the 53rd week and the change at Lowe's. And our paints EBIT rate was up 2015 despite the headwinds we faced. 
Turning now to some highlights by geography. I'll talk about North America first. Our team did an excellent job in partnership with Lowe's to drive sales at Valspar Paint. The strong consumer demand for our brand and products combined with exceptional teamwork resulted in double digit retail sale-through of Valspar products at Lowe's excluding the discontinued product. And sell-through improved sequentially from Q3 to Q4. In the hardware channel, we finished our first full year with Valspar branded paints at Ace. The store resets and implementation of robust selling model resulted in double digit retail sale through at Ace. 
As a reminder, we also have another strong consumer brand in North America which is Cabot, one of the best wood stains. In 2015, we added significant new distribution in about 2,500 Ace stores and at 500 Home Depot stores. These new distribution combined with more than 6,000 independent retailers that carry the Cabot brand provide us an excellent foundation for continued growth. Closing out my comments on North America, excluding the change at Lowe's, our sell-through of Valspar Paint in the combined home improvement and hardware channels was up double digit in 2015. We believe this is over 3x overall industry growth. 
Our international business also had a strong year. Australia volumes grew mid single digits for the year and our EBIT margin rate improved to the high single digits. Turning to Europe, as you recall just nine months ago we completed the rollout of Valspar Paint and our retail operating model at over 350 B&Q stores. In 2015, our volume growth at B&Q was strong and to date we doubled the amount of paints that is tinted in B&Q stores. 
In Asia, both volume and EBIT growth in the Paint segment were up high single digits in the year. Our growth was driven by new products and product line extensions. We also increased our distribution in China from about 9,000 stores to over 12,000 stores. Wrapping up the Paint segment in 2015 we made a great acquisition. Quest doubled the size of our auto refinish product line, customer response to the combined offering has been terrific and we are on track with the integration and are very excited about this business going forward. 
So overall as I previously said I am very pleased with our performance in 2015. We continue to lever our success and strong cash flow to enhance shareholder returns. In 2015, we increased our dividend by 15% and repurchased about 5% of our outstanding shares. 
Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect that the US dollar will continue to strengthen against our relevant basket of currencies. So we are modeling approximately 4% to 5% impact on our top line from FX. Excluding the impact of currency, we expect mid single digits growth in our top line and 8% to 13% EPS growth. These assumptions do not reflect the material change in end market demand across our portfolio next year. So to drive growth we will continue with the same formula that has made us successful in the past. We will focus on being world class partner to our customers, investing in our brand and technology, winning new business and continuing to be more productive in everything that we do. 
We have a fabulous team here at Valspar with over 11,000 people focused on delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We've many levers at our disposal to drive value and as 2015 results show you can count on our team to deliver. 
With that I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the Q4 results and our outlook. 
Jim Muehlbauer
Good morning, everyone. Gary has covered the key highlights for the fiscal year. So I'll focus my comments this morning on our fourth quarter performance and outlook for fiscal 2016. Let's start with performance in Q4. As we've highlighted on the last several calls, results in the fourth quarter reflect the unfavorable impact of both foreign currency and the 53rd week last year. We estimate these two items had a combined effect of lowering Q4 sales growth by approximately 10%. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, Q4 sales and volumes increased 1%. This doesn't give you the complete underlying story. As these results also include the impact of the change at Lowe's, which lowered volume in sales by 5% in the quarter. So as you can see the underlying growth of the business was certainly more robust than the headline results. 
Looking at the top line performance in our two segments in Q4. Coatings segment volumes were down 3% and sales declined 11%. These results were up against very strong performance last year when coatings sales increased 15%. Excluding the impact of FX and the 53rd week, coatings volume and sales were flat in Q4, which was essentially in line with the performance trends we saw last quarter. Highlighting our coatings performance, the general industrial product line grew new business particularly in Asia and Latin America. And we've continued to see solid growth in the US from new business wins. 
The packaging product line increased market share in non-BPA products and have very strong overall volume growth in Asia, and also improved volume in Latin America. These gains were offset by lower market demand for food cans in Q4. As a result of the weaker food pack in the US and Europe. In addition, we've not yet anniversary the lower margin loss business in the Middle East we previously referenced which lowered volumes in the quarter. Our coil product line increased volume driven by strong new business wins in the fourth quarter especially in the Americas which comprised the bulk of our sales. As Gary mentioned earlier, coil has been a very strong performer in our coatings portfolio and had another excellent year. Rounding out the Coatings segment, the wood product line also grew share in the quarter and increased volume in North America and Asia. 
Switching over to the Paints segment. Q4 volumes were down 2% and sales declined 7%. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, volumes and sales increased 1%. The addition of Quest increased volumes and sales by 5% and 10% respectively during the quarter. Q4 highlights in the Paints segment include strong product sell- through in the North America region. While total volume declined as expected driven by the change of Lowe's. Our sale through was very strong and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter. Our sales for the full year at Lowe's finished in line with our plan. This performance demonstrates the strength of our products and brands with consumers. And execution capabilities with our retail partners. Our results this year put us on the very low end of our fiscal 2015 estimate of the $150 million to $180 million revenue impact from the change of Lowe's. 
In Asia, volumes increased mid single digit on top of the strong double digit growth last year. The increase was driven by broader distribution of our products. In fiscal 2015, we increased point of distribution by 30% in China. In Australia, Q4 volumes were down mid single digit as we are up against double digit comps due to the load in of a new price point at Masters last year. 
Sales increased low single digit in constant currency driven by improved sales mix versus the previous year. In Europe, volumes increased strong double digit and we continue to improve sell-through of products in the B&Q stores. 
Moving on to overall gross margins. We finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 36.7%, up 213 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by benefits from our restructuring and productivity programs across the business and from cost price. These programs include ongoing activities to lower costs and improve efficiency in our manufacturing, supply chain and procurement activities. 
Looking at expenses in Q4, operating expense dollar declined 6% driven by the impact of FX and lower incentive expense. Adjusted OpEx as a percent of sales increased 70 basis points to 21.1% primarily as the result of lower sales .Bringing it altogether, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 1% and EBIT margins improved 150 basis points to 15.4%. For comparison purposes, if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, we estimate Q4 EBIT growth was closer to 10%. In the Coatings segment, adjusted fourth quarter EBIT of $125 million increased 7% and was up 310 basis points. The increase in EBIT was primarily driven by benefits from productivity initiatives and improved cost price. Paints segment adjusted EBIT of $63 million was down 10% from the prior year. This decrease was driven lower sales partially offset by productivity initiatives and the addition of the Quest acquisition. Paints EBIT rate was 14% which was down to last year. As Gary mentioned, for the full year Paints EBIT rate finished at 11.5%, up 20 basis points. This is solid performance especially considering the combined impact of the change at Lowe's and FX during the year. 
Cash flow from operations excluding cash restructuring expense improved significantly in the fourth quarter to finish the fiscal year at approximately $404 million, which is an increase of 4%. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operation less CapEx improved approximately 15% reflecting the improvement in operating cash flow and lower CapEx spending. Overall, we are pleased with the performance in fiscal 2015 in light of the environment we described at the beginning of the year. We successfully added new business, improved market share positions, manage through a product line change and improved operating margins to 130 basis points for the year.
With this as context on 2015, let's move on to discuss our outlook for fiscal 2016. The strengthening US dollar will continue to impact our results in fiscal 2016. We expect the annual sales growth to be up mid single digit in constant currency. This would result in our reported sales been up slightly compared to fiscal 2015 including the estimated impact of FX. We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5 representing growth of 4% to 8%. Included in the EPS guidance is a $0.20 unfavorable impact from FX. EPS is expected to grow 8% to 13% excluding the impact FX. Within this guidance are the following additional assumptions. The continued strengthening of the US dollar is expected to lower sales by approximately 4% to 5% which is similar to what we saw in fiscal 2015. The full year benefit of the Quest acquisition will add approximately 3% sales. We expect an annual effective tax rate of between 30% and 31% and CapEx of approximately $110 million to $120 million and D&A of approximately $100 million. A couple of additional items to keep in mind for fiscal 2016. The first quarter will be our most challenging period during the year from a comparison perspective. This is driven by several factors. First, the US dollar strengthened as we move through fiscal 2015. Therefore we currently expect biggest FX headwinds to occur in Q1. Second as you know we have one more quarter until we fully annualize the impact of the change at Lowe's. Third, we are facing difficult comparisons in the coatings segment when volumes were up 10% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. And finally interest expense in Q1 will be up year-over-year driven purely by the timing of our bond issuance in 2015. To be clear, all of these items are embedded in our outlook. The good news is that after Q1 we lap both the change at Lowe's and the debt issuance timing. In addition, the coatings comp ease considerably as we progress through the year. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our performance in 2015, both in the context of the macro environment and as the specific challenges we faced in the year. We are focused on growing the business in 2016. And as Gary said we have lots of levers at our disposal to improve returns and drive shareholder value. 
With that, we would like to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bob Koort
Thank you. Good morning. Gary, Jim, in your earnings guidance, I was wondering did you discuss what your assumed share repurchase activity is through the year? 
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes, Bob, we haven't assumed anything materially different than what we guided to in the past where we publicly said that we are going to be out in the market place purchasing minimum of 2% a year. So we haven't reflected anything further than that as usual.
Bob Koort
And I know you don't like to talk specifics about your customers, but the two big DIY guys have both mentioned increased promotional efforts around the paint space. Just wondering, how would you characterize the sequential expectation into 2016? Will there be a net reduction in spending on promotions and net increase flat?
Gary Hendrickson 
Yes, I mean it is hard to predict, Bob. And you are right it was a little bit more promotional this year I think that's pretty common when there is a new entrant into the channel. But going into next year, as far as Valspar is concerned I don't think we are going to be doing -- we are not planning at least anything materially different from what we did this year. 
Bob Koort
And then my last one you had a terrific margin in the quarter, EBIT margin maybe as high as anything that I can find historically, contained in that guidance youâve given where the revenue line isn't going to move because of FX but your earnings are going up, should we anticipate further increases in margin for 2016 and is that price, volume, raw materials, all the above?
Gary Hendrickson
The way I think about this, Bob, and Jim looks like he wants to give his perspective as well, but if we are growing and which we are, we will be growing in constant currency we think. And we are doing the things that we know how to do with regard to productivity. And we are going to leverage that growth in to improve margins. That's the way we think about our business model. 
Operator
Our next question today comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ivan Marcuse
The first one is on the Lowe's business, you talked about seeing high double, or growing over the market 3X. Is there any expectations of any further line adjustments going into next year? And with the success of your current products, could you see yourself gaining any market share back in any of those channels?
Gary Hendrickson
I mean those are pretty specific questions, Ivan. Let me just say that we are really pleased obviously with the sell-through of Valspar this year at that customer. It is collaborative effort between our team and theirs. We talked about double digit sell through being over 3x with the market, that's combination of that team work, great brand and great products. So that's the -- what we call Valspar operating model, we expect to be running that model next year. With respect to line reviews I'd say -- I'd just say this that globally and I am not referring to any specific customer when I say this, but globally we had a net positive results in the line of new process across our portfolio this year. 
Ivan Marcuse
Great. Thanks. And then next question, there's been a lot of talk about China. I know you referred to it a little bit in your prepared comments. How would you define I guess the market there in terms of your architectural and in your industrial, which I guess would be mostly wood?
Jim Muehlbauer 
Yes. Our industrial market there this year, Ivan, performed very well. Really based on the growth that we were able to drive in the packaging product line and the success we've had in growing our general industrial business with local Chinese customers on heavy equipment and through the container business. So while there is certainly some headwind pressures in the market place overall, we've been participating in those coatings segment which have been growing for us. Our paints business there -- we've done a nice job expanding point of distribution that drove the growth that Gary mentioned his comments this morning but want to see how the year plays out next year. Clearly there has been more volatility that's come up in China over the last six months. And itâs probably wider range of outcomes in that market place but what we are focused on is continuing to grow our points of distribution. And we got lot of market share yet to gain in that market place so we really have focused that business over the last couple of years at gaining market share. And anything that we get from the industry growth standpoint is really considered a tailwind from our perspective. 
Ivan Marcuse
Last question and I'll jump back in the queue. You mentioned Cabot gaining 500 stores and being in Ace. Did that impact 2015 at all, or is this all pretty much 2016? How would you quantify how big of a piece of business that is?
Gary Hendrickson
Let's just say it was a modest impact in 2015, more of an impact in 2016, Ivan. We had some start up cost associated with it getting that product into that distribution so 2016 will be better than was 2015.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
David Begleiter
Thank you, good morning. Gary and Jim in 2016 what type of tailwind do you expect from raw materials next year, year-over-year?
Gary Hendrickson
Not a lot, if any David. Weâre sort of expecting the exit rate on Q4 to be relatively stable through 2016. So in our model, we don't have a raw material benefit built into the guidance. 
David Begleiter
Understood. And Gary how would characterize overall industrial activity? Maybe you can walk around the key regions around the world.
Gary Hendrickson
North America seems to be doing pretty well. And I am sorry I am going to be pretty -- I am going to be very general in my commentary, David, but as you know we tend to think about this as specific to the markets that we participate in and we are not exposed to the whole economy. Europe probably stable I would say. I am not sure that it is growing but I don't think it is declining. There are some contemporary events that may impact sentiment next year but as, at least as we came out of Q4 I would say that our markets were stable. China as Jim just tried to articulate is a mix bag; we expect that our packaging coatings market will grow again next year. Ag and construction probably down again next year based on what our customers are saying. Consumer -- our consumer business based on housing in China and I think the government is trying to stimulate housing again in China so that could be a positive story, but weâll just have to wait and see. So it is a mix bag. I hate to generalize, it is specific to region and it is specific to market but as Jim mentioned I think the relevant point as we think about next year is that we are not anticipating any material change in the markets that we sell into in 2016, either up or down. 
David Begleiter
And just lastly Jim and Gary how is the M&A pipeline looking for you guys? 
Gary Hendrickson
About the way it normally does, David. We were active on several deals. I think we will probably be closing a smallish one in the next quarter. And then there are some others that will take little bit longer but could potentially come our way. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.
PJ Juvekar 
Hi, good morning, Gary and Jim. In paints, price mix was a little bit weak in the quarter was down 5%. Is the mix issue mostly outside the US? And how is the pricing looking in different channels? 
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes, PJ the mix issue was outside the US primarily in our business in China. The pricing element that you are referring to was exactly what Gary just talked about really the promotional environment as we exited the back half of the year was a little bit more promotional to drive volumes. So that's reflected in that numbers as well. 
Gary Hendrickson
That price, PJ, just to be clear price includes promotional activity that's one time. 
PJ Juvekar 
Okay. And then you talked about Cabot stain introduction at home depot and at Ace. How big is that opportunity? 
Gary Hendrickson
Yes. Let's wait until we get a little further into the year before we expose that out PJ, there is just little bit of sensitivity on that. 
PJ Juvekar 
And just going back to David Begleiter's question about raw materials. Why wouldn't you see raw material benefit in 2016? All your raw materials including oil-based propylene-based products are down. TiO2 prices keep going down. Why wouldn't you expect a raw material benefit?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. PJ what Gary mentioned is that as we look at the exit rates in our raw materials for planning purposes for next year we haven't assumed any material change from how we are exiting Q4. So as you know some of those input costs started to decline in Q2 last year so really from our standpoint we are not looking for a material change on how we are exiting this year. And we will see what happens as the year plays out from a demand environment standpoint. 
Operator
We go to the next one and from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead.
Nils Wallin
Yes, good morning and thanks for taking my question. 
I noticed on general industrial, there was some price increases, or at least you had price mix to your benefit. And certainly there was some worries with raw materials coming down that you might have some pressure there. Would you be able to tease apart what was the driver of the good pricing in general industrial?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes, primarily mix. Our teams have done a nice job of winning new business with protective coatings products which have a little bit better mix -- little bit better margin from a mix standpoint. So more mix driven than anything else Nils.
Nils Wallin 
Great. And then on packaging the price weakness, was that mainly from exiting the lower margin business that you did earlier in the year? 
Jim Muehlbauer
Well we didn't exit the lower margin business. Overall as we mentioned we've been growing our share of non-BPA it is more of mix of packaging volume across various geographies given the significant growth in China. That has a little bit of mix impact on a total as well. 
Nils Wallin
Understood. And then just a last one if I may kind of housekeeping. Your guidance on FX does seem to be little bit aggressive. Is that just mainly a comp issue in terms of when these things affect or do you expect some additional weakness in other currency that we haven't seen this year?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. Two things. Number one I think it is the last year proven for all companies. We are not experts, companies aren't experts and we estimate what FX is going to do for a full year so how we build that guidance is that we look at a consensus view about the large bank's forecast for the various currencies and we apply it against our basket overall. So we will see what that actually ends for the year. But as I noted in my prepared remarks, if you look at how that basket changed in 2015, FX took -- it had a very big after starting in Q2. So we expect the biggest headwind in FX for next year in our first quarter overall. And we will just have to see things like, if I just told the FX rates that we see today into the market place all of next year assume no changes, it probably has 2.5% negative impact to our top line overall. So we've got outlook that is a little bit more of decline I would say that's more in the camp of what we seen in the external estimate and coincidentally it is pretty similar to what we saw this year. We just have to see what actually happens. 
Operator
Next we will go back to line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Dmitry Silversteyn
Hi, let's hope this button pressing works okay. You hear me okay now? Hey, great. Can you talk about the timing, you mentioned anniversarying some of the headwinds as far as foreign exchange in the channel fill or channel loss, I should say, as Lowe's is concerned. When are you looking to anniversary the loss of the packaging coatings business in Asia?
Gary Hendrickson
First of all it wasn't Asia. It was Middle East, Dmitry. 
Dmitry Silversteyn
I am sorry, yes, okay. 
Gary Hendrickson
And you know what that the part of the reason we call that out is because as I mentioned it was high volume low margin business and since our crack investor relations group has gotten so much more transparent with the information, we didn't want our investors to believe and we didn't want investors to believe that we are losing share packaging which we are not. And so we disclosed that fact that there was a relatively high volume if that there. The impact -- the profitability impact is honest. But we anniversary that in Q2.
Dmitry Silversteyn
Q2 will be the last period we see them so three, four it should be clean comp as far as that business not being there? 
Gary Hendrickson
Yes. 
Dmitry Silversteyn
Okay. Secondly, your guidance for CapEx for 2016 seems to be fairly elevated given your recent rates. I think you are at top end of about $120 million which is more than you spend this year. Any particular projects driving the higher, the normal CapEx expectations? 
Jim Muehlbauer 
No. We got a couple of capacity projects to support the very solid growth we've seen in elements of our general industrial business and to support the strong packaging growth numbers that we've been talking about. We under spent this year a little bit just due to timing as you recall our original guidance for the year we spent more than $100 million so some of those projects Dmitry are just moving into next year. 
Dmitry Silversteyn
Okay, and then on the working capital again, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, I think it's the highest in several years. Obviously, you've got a lot of channel fills that took place during the year. Is that what we are basically seeing here in terms of working capital, or how should we think about that unwinding itself as we get into 2016?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. We are looking to improve that working capital performance next year. And you correctly call out that has been impacted this year little bit by the new business wins activity that we've talked about. Also the impact of FX works its way through working capital as well and that we are comparing our ending balance sheet this year to the ending balance sheet last year and it is pretty dramatic change in FX between those two periods overall. So the other thing I would comment on is as we saw sales in the quarter are working actually are accounts receivable right with little higher as we exited the year solely driven by the timing of sales within the quarter. So overall we are not surprised by what we've seen in working capital as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have great performance in the quarter. And eventually ended up growing operating cash flow pretty consistent with our net income growth for the year. 
Dmitry Silversteyn
Okay. And then one final question, just on your growth outlook, excluding foreign exchange in mid single digits. You mentioned that Quest will add about 3%. It sounds like your business at Lowe's and Ace and the North American business in general in paint should be up, maybe not double digits you saw this year, but should be up somewhat next year. So is the relatively what I would consider conservative guidance for 2016 in terms of organic volume growth, is that basically stemming from expectations of industrial coating weakness?
Jim Muehlbauer 
Well, I just maybe helicopter up little bit more Dmitry, I think it hit lot of the key points but if you look at our sales performance this year in total excluding FX we are about flat right. So if you start with that as a base and you add the benefit for Quest next year which would add about another 3%, the comment that you had around -- and we haven't anniversary the change at Lowe's that's going to be worth about negative 1% to sales for the year. And then we typically target 3% to 4% new business growth. So when you put all those pieces together you kind of get a mid single digit outcome for next year. 
Dmitry Silversteyn
Okay, all right. But it sounds like if Lowe's growth is sustained at some elevated level and the markets don't go completely negative on next year there is some upside to your expectations?
Jim Muehlbauer 
Yes. I mean I think what we try to do is based on what we see today in the market we are just trying to hit the ball down the middle of the fairway and we will see things play out, I think we are confident is that we are going to grow new business and we expect to go faster into the market next year.

Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, it is Tom calling for Arun. One of your peers talked about some inventory destocking that happened in the quarter in the paint side. And I just wanted to see if you experienced any of that? 
Gary Hendrickson
Yes. 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And I know you were saying we don't expect much from raws next year in terms of a benefit. Was the coating margin strength entirely from the productivity enhancements, or was there any raw material benefit there?
Gary Hendrickson
It was primarily from product restructuring and productivity with I would say a modest benefit from price costs.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then, could you remind us what the other segment EBIT performance is on a seasonal basis. What typically happens in 4Q? Is that just an administrative thing?
Jim Muehlbauer
Well, in other segment first is the performance a couple of product line like most significantly our resin business, the other element that sets within the other segment is some corporative administrative expenses and typically in the fourth quarter plus we are doing true ups for incentive expense so that can have a disproportion impact in the fourth quarter so those are -- that would be the only really seasonal things that I recall out that happens in Q4 and the other segment. 
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then lastly on Quest, just the auto refinish segment, is there any desire to get more deep in that segment? We are seeing some of your peers take advantage of the higher margins that brings in coatings. Is at something you are targeting to get deeper in, or are you seeing any increased competitiveness there?
Gary Hendrickson
It was a good acquisition, double the size of the refinish business that we had. Yes, we are happy with-- we are happy with our positioning both from a competitive point of view and from a future opportunities point of view so without getting specific about any future plans, I'd just say we are pleased that we were able to do that acquisition and is going extraordinarily well.

Our next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.
Mehul Dalia 
Hi, good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in Ghansham. What are the various puts and takes to get the high or low end of your guidance range, and what are your macro assumptions across your major regions for 2016?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. So Gary already walked through kind of from a macro standpoint, we are not expecting any material change in the markets we serve. So if I helicopter up and say what would change -- we would have it move between the high end and the low end of the range first and most obvious option would be what's the performance of the macro on those end market. So what is market growth do? Second would be the other item I referred to earlier is where do we see FX actually indeed for the year. Those are probably the two biggest variables that are not within our control. We are still confident about the carrying new business we have for next year and our new business growth plans and need to the market places about the macro market move and the FX environment we probably single digit drivers. 
Mehul Dalia 
Okay, perfect. Was there any major deviation month-to-month in terms of demand across the paint and coatings business during the last quarter?
Jim Muehlbauer
I said in my prepared remarks we really saw in the coatings business pretty similar performance what we saw in the third quarter overall in aggregate. And it also impact in the paints segment. And we saw a good performance across each of the market places that I don't think there is anything that I recall as notable between Q3 versus Q4 other than the sequential improve in our customer uptick in North America. 
Mehul Dalia 
Perfect. And then just one last one, can you expand in your growth in general industrial? It has been pretty solid. Is it all share gain or are there certain applications you are exposed to than your competitors, on driving outsized growth there?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. Most of it is from our new business wins. Our teams have done a really nice job growing market share and the protective coatings business, tin coatings and kind of growing our general industrial franchise both in Europe and in Asia. Also interestingly we got actually very strong performance in Latin America this year in our coatings business. Almost lies the movement the better economy that especially in Brazil, Mexico has been very strong for us. And our North America business is continuing to participate from the nice steady growth we've seen in the construction markets in the US. So it has been a good year for coatings to say the least.

Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Co. 
Rosemarie Morbelli
Thank you and good morning, everyone. I was wondering, if you look at the coil business, do you have a feel for where those particular coils are going, which type of end market? Is it appliances, is it some other category?
Gary Hendrickson
Our business is skewed towards building products and appliances, Rosemarie. By end users 
Rosemarie Morbelli
Okay and they more or less walk hand-in-hand, except for the timing you sunk into construction, and then when everything is done you put in the appliances?
Gary Hendrickson
Yes. I don't -- if you are trying to ask if we got a correlation between some factors and demand our coil business, I'd have to say that it is not as strong as --
Jim Muehlbauer
Somewhat related.
Gary Hendrickson
Somewhat related but not as strong as you might think. 
Rosemarie Morbelli
Okay. And since construction has been strong in North America, do you see that particular business here since essentially stronger in Asia even though the government is pushing housing in the smaller cities the tier two and three I believe. 
Gary Hendrickson
We are very small in coil in Asia, Rosemarie. Just we just have a small business in China and it is a focused on niche segments of the market rather than a broader market. So I can't help you with that question. I am sorry. 
Rosemarie Morbelli
That's all right. And looking at your non-BPA coatings what you think the conversion trends? Have all of the cans and most of the cans in beverage packagers, whatever it is, have they all converted to non-BPA, or is there still a lot of room for growth?
Gary Hendrickson
No, they have not. And in fact in beverage there has only been a very modest conversion to non-BPA coatings so there is a long runway there should that market ever convert. And in food can and in general wine can, the conversion is well underway. We are probably in the third year of it. There is probably two years left before you would say that almost all of those can have converted to non-BPA coating so for us we still see significant room for growth. 
Rosemarie Morbelli
So even the fact that the industry is still converting, it is still not enough to offset a slowdown in the number of vegetables, meat, and fish whatever products are being canned? Am I correct?
Jim Muehlbauer 
Yes. That was just in the quarter Rosemarie. What we are trying to talk about is just our volume performance in the quarter. 
Rosemarie Morbelli
Okay, all right. And you should look into full year, when I look at the top line growth or volume growth for packaging in industrial coil, wood the full year is stronger than the fourth quarter, so that -- it makes me wonder as you while you are not expecting many changes whether there was actually a slowdown in the fourth quarter and why do you think that it is not going to continue into 2016?
Jim Muehlbauer
Yes. Well probably the first thing to look at and I realize we try to provide a lot of transparency in the quarter given the impact of the 53rd week last year and FX. So some of it could be seen Rosemarie as the volumes numbers last year were up against much more difficult comparison. So when you take out the impact of the 53rd week and FX our trends in the quarter were pretty similar to what we saw last quarter. So I would not say there has been a sequential slowdown. 
Operator
And we go to line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, thanks. This is [McKinger John] [ph for Vincent. How should we think about your plans to expand your architectural paint presence in to continental Europe in terms of both timing and magnitude, would such an expansion be incremental to your guidance range for the fiscal 2016? 
Gary Hendrickson
I wouldn't be -- if you are asking short-term question about 2016 then I wouldn't model anything, I don't expect that there will be a significant movement in 2016. In the longer term, we've talked about our partnership with B&Q as a potential lever into the broader market in continental Europe and we still think that's a possibility but there is no news on that front at this point. 
Operator
And we will go to line of Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Mike Ritzenthaler
Yes, good morning. Just a couple of follow up. There is a lot of good questions already but within coatings I guess you gone into lot of detail about GI not necessarily following the end markets as closely as one might think but outside a share gain what's supporting that those volumes? Is it technology? What is Valspar bringing to the market a little granularity like that and I guess that the crest of the question is around as you look at share donors, do gains have sufficient runways for two or three more years of this consistency? 
Gary Hendrickson 
Yes. I mean we are very small part of the overall -- I can't remember the percentage as exactly but less than 5% of the overall markets. So we've got a tremendous runway. And as I think I said earlier Jim said we got nice pipeline growth opportunities. They come across the spectrum of markets and we -- it is hard to say call out a particular opportunity that really moves the dial. The general industrial business that grows by singles and doubles not whole months the way I say our retail business, Mike. We think our strengths are great technology, innovative technology, the relationships with our customers and the terrific service model that we want to support. That as you seen -- you have seen the trend has been five years or so
Mike Ritzenthaler
Right. 
Gary Hendrickson
Pretty regular and cost and predictable growth in our coatings segment. And thatâs what we expect that we will be able to accomplish next year as well. 
Bill Seymour
Operator, this will be the next question the last question and then Gary will have some closing comments. 
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financials. 
Emily Wagner
Hi. This is actually Emily Wagner on for Don. I just had a question about the packaging business. You mentioned you have the leading share in non-BPA, and we've heard competitors mention improvement in this business as well. Could you address the current geographic positioning and competition you're seeing from new market entrants? 
Gary Hendrickson
Yes. I am not sure what you are referring to, what our competitors have said to you Emily but I can tell you that we are comprehensively winning market share in non-BPA coatings. 
Emily Wagner
Okay and geographically Europe -- 
Gary Hendrickson
Everywhere. Everywhere where our customer request a non-BPA coatings, Valspar is there, we have 100% of the technology that our customers need for non-BPA coatings whether it is two piece can or three piece can or aerosol can, whatever type of can, whatever application we have 100% of the technologies that they need. 
Gary Hendrickson
And thanks everyone for joining our call today. As you heard, we are pleased with the way our team executed in 2015. And you can absolutely expect the same from us this year. Our 2016 top line guidance includes benefit of carrying business won in 2015. A robust pipeline of new business opportunities in coatings and the positive impact of line review win in our global consumer paint business. It is business as usual at Valspar and we expect to convert this growth to improve earnings and shareholder value. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone who has joined the call today.
