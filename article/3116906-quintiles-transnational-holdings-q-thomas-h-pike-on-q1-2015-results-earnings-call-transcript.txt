On behalf of Quintiles, good morning and welcome to Quintiles First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call Webcast. My name is Dana, and I will be your web event specialist today.
It is now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles first quarter 2015 earnings call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risk and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 12, 2015.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Karl. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Now, let's begin on slide three with some highlights. We started the year with a good quarter that generally played out the way we expected. It was notable for the strong high quality sales and product development and the benefit of having two complementary business units as well as the announcement of an important new joint venture in our Central Lab business.
Like other global businesses, we've been impacted by foreign exchange and therefore, we'll discuss many our results in constant currency to improve comparability. The strong new business pipeline entering the year continued and we booked $1.35 billion of net new business during the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 1.31 times service revenues and a growth of 10.5% at constant currency.
The service revenues grew by 8.4% at constant currency with strong growth from our Integrated Healthcare Services or IHS business. Higher IHS service revenue mix translated into a higher contribution on the bottom-line for this segment compared to the same period last year.
Overall adjusted income from operations margin was 14.4%. There were some positive foreign exchange benefits within this, given our efficiency focus global operating model. On a consolidated basis, we finished the quarter with $0.72 of diluted adjusted earnings per share representing growth of 5.9%.
Now, let me give a little bit of a topline view on our segment's new business. Product development, the first quarter net new business continued to trend the strong bookings with favorable service mix that we've had over the past two quarters. We booked net new business totaling $1.09 billion, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.45 time service revenues in this quarter. The net new business growth at constant currency was 11.9% compared to the same period last year and included an improved mix of attractive clinical full service studies.
In the IHS segment, we booked net new business of $260 million representing a book-to-bill of 0.93 times services revenues for the first quarter, quarter that's historically seasonably lower for bookings in the commercial business.
Net new business growth at constant currency was 5.3% compared to the same period last year. Our trailing 12-month IHS book-to-bill is in line with our historical average of 1.1 times. Overall, new business wins remained solid in both segments resulting in over $11 billion of backlogs spread across a diverse customer base.
Before turning over to Kevin for more detail on the financial results, it's important to mention in this morning's announcement that our Board of Directors has approved an increase in share repurchase authorization under the company's previously approved share repurchase program by $300 million, increasing the total available authorization to approximately $360 million. Our confidence in our growth strategies and the strength of our cash flow allows us to continue to invest in growth while providing capital returns to shareholders.
Now, let me turn it over to Kevin.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the consolidated results on slide four.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2015 consolidated service revenues grew 8.4% at constant currency compared to the same prior year quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues grew 2.5% to approximately $1.03 billion in the quarter including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $59 million. The global mix of service revenues shifted towards North America in the quarter, as result of the strong commercial North America, Real World Late Phase Research revenues and Encore revenue contribution.
For the quarter, the North America, Latin America region contributed 45% of revenues or 400 basis points more than the same period last year. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region contributed 34%, 500 basis points lower than the same period last year and the Asia-Pacific region remained steady at 21% of the total consolidated revenues.
During the quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 4.4% to $148.5 million, a margin of 14.4% with 20 basis points of margin expansion, including 110 points from positive foreign currency exchange, offset by a change in segment revenue mix, more heavily weighted towards IHS compared to the same period in 2014, and higher cost in the product development segment.
For the first quarter SG&A was $219.6 million or 21.3% of service revenues compared to $219.2 million or 21.8% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included costs associated with Encore, and increased compensation related costs, including stock compensation, offset by a positive impact from foreign exchange and lower incentive compensation costs.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 29.7% during the quarter compared to 30.5% for the same period in 2014. Adjusted net income in the first quarter was fairly flat at $91.2 million compared to the same period last year. The prior year benefited from a $5 million gain from marketable securities and approximately $4 million or more of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates compared to the first quarter of this year.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 5.9% to $0.72 per share in the first quarter compared to $0.68 per share in the prior year quarter that included the benefit of the two below the line operating line items just mentioned. We recognized $5.3 million of net restructuring charges during the first quarter in connection with previously announced and approved restructuring plans. We expect to incur additional costs under these plans throughout 2015. Our cash balance was strong at $779 million at of the end of the quarter of which $232 million was in the U.S. As experienced in the first quarter of most years, due to annual payments for the prior year incentive plans and payments for other accrued liabilities, we used cash in the operations in the first quarter of this year.
Cash used in operations was $64.3 million in the current year quarter compared to $28.4 million used for the same period in 2014. The increase in cash used during the quarter reflects higher payments for income taxes and incentive compensation and an increase in days sales outstanding or DSO. The first quarter DSO increased two days compared to the same period in 2014 and five days compared to year end 2014 as yearend DSO days have been historically lower.
Capital expenditures were $16.4 million for the quarter or 1.6% of service revenues compared to $17.7 million during the same period in 2014. Our net debt outstanding defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at March 31, 2015 was $1.52 billion compared to $1.43 billion at the end of December 2014, and increasing due to the lower cash balance.
With a strong new business booked during the quarter, we added $316 million more new backlog than we burned revenue. This increase was offset by $496 million of negative foreign exchange revaluation to actual March end exchange rates for a total ending first quarter backlog of $11.1 billion.
Now, let's move to the segments. On slide, please turn to slide five. We'll have a look at the two reporting segments. A product development segment accounted for 73% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 27%, a 400 basis greater contribution from IHS compared to the first quarter of 2014 due to the stronger revenue growth in this segment including the addition of Encore.
Product developments constant currency revenue growth was 1.9% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. At actual foreign exchange rates, product development service revenues were $749.5 million, including $36.2 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts compared to the same period in the prior year.
The lower growth rate and product development was largely due to the generally anticipated negative impact of cancellations primarily from the second and fourth quarters of 2014, and lower than expected advisory revenue. The impact of the cancellations is expected to mitigate in the second half of 2015 as new projects from the recent new business wins transition from project start-up days into higher revenue generating activities. Product development income from operations for the quarter was $157 million, a 2.3% decline in actual rates and 5.8% decline at constant currency rates.
Product Development income from operations margin was 20.9% in the quarter, representing an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year including 160 basis points from foreign currency benefits offset by service revenue mix within the segment and increased compensation related costs resulting from an increase in billable head count to support the start-up of recent business wins and investments associated with our productivity initiatives.
We expect the compensation related cost to continue into the second half of 2015 when we expect to deliver higher revenue growth from the recent strong new business. IHS service revenues grew 29.3% at constant currency rates in the first quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, service revenues were $280.5 million representing an increase of 19.6% or (12:35) last year, which also included unfavorable (12:41).
The increase in service revenues (12:47) segment was attributable to commercial North America and Japan, a continuation of very strong growth in our Real World Late Phase Research unit and $19.4 million from the Encore acquisition, offset by lower service revenues in commercial Europe including the loss of service revenues from an agreement to distribute pharmaceutical products in Italy that concluded in the fourth quarter of 2014.
IHS income from operations for the first quarter was $18.1 million, 102.5% growth at actual rates and 130.2% at constant currency rates compared to the same period in 2014. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 6.5% at actual rates and 6.8% at constant currency. Margins improved 300 basis points at constant currency from a positive service mix change from higher margin services, 50 basis points from increased SG&A leverage. Now, turning to our 2015 guidance. We've updated our 2015 constant currency service revenue growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8% compared to full year 2014. With the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect our full year service revenues to be impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately 520 basis points compared to 2014.
This guidance assumes a higher contribution from IHS in the first half of the year, as we reported in the first quarter, due to lower year-over-year comparables plus the incremental first half benefit from the July 2014 Encore acquisition, which then normalizes to more historical levels in the second half of the year. It also assumes the Product Development segment will start the first half of the year slower due to cancellations from 2014 and the anticipated increase in service revenues in the second half of the year as projects transition from start-up phase of clinical development process into higher revenue generating activities.
We expect to achieve diluted adjusted earnings per share between $3.02 and $3.13 per share, representing growth of 12% to 16% and diluted GAAP earnings per share between $2.89 and $3.03 per share. We expect the annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 29.5%. Our guidance assumes foreign currency exchange rates at the end of March for the balance of the year, but does not reflect the potential impact of any future equity repurchases or the impact of the pending joint venture announced with Quest Diagnostics.
Finally, as we regularly evaluate our debt arrangements as well as market conditions, we're exploring refinancing our existing debt arrangements to capitalize on the currently favorable market conditions. We cannot provide assurance the markets will remain favorable or that we will complete any new financing arrangement, however, we will begin the process as announced this morning.
I will now turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Kevin. Turning to slide seven. As you see our product development net new business remains strong. To help indicate the strength of the market, we often mention the RFP flow. This past quarter, and as we sit today, that clinical services RFP flow remains at the high levels we've seen over the past two years.
We had a very strong quarter with emerging biotech in terms of new business. The combination of our Novella acquisition and our emerging biotech offering lets us leverage off the growth that's occurring in this segment. They want to leverage our deep skills. Biotech funding for the first quarter was up significantly year-on-year. In addition, the number of compounds in Phase I to III pipeline continues to grow sequentially compared to 2014 year-end with over 4,700 compounds at the end of the first quarter compared to 4,600 at the end of 2014. These dynamics continue to bode well for our sector and Quintiles in particular.
Our product development net new business for the next two quarters in particular capitalized in the strong market trends. Our fourth quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015 net new business and product development was a better mix of traditional end-to-end clinical development studies versus functional resourcing studies and a more balanced mix across customer segments, with just over 50% of our first quarter net new business coming from outside of top 20 pharma. We believe this mix should improve our product development service revenue growth in the second half of 2015. It may be worth sharing a few things going on in the product development segment to give you more color on what we see. We have approximately 15% more clinical projects in start-up than at this time last year. And in our business, revenue producing activities come as the study matures.
As we've also mentioned before, the complexity of trials has extended the projects somewhat, also impacting start-up time lines and revenues. Given the new business wins that we've had, we expect to see more growth in the second half of the year in product development. Because we are in a people intensive business, you can see the preparation for that growth in our operating margins in that segment. In addition, we're doing other things to maintain our market leadership. We're allocating more people to emerging biopharma, to rare diseases and oncology, representing the way our pipeline and activities are flowing. We have an exciting transformational program to improve the investigator and customer experience and we continue to enhance our technology strategy, including our leading risk based monitoring capabilities.
We also continue to reengineer and take advantage of our global delivery network. On the integrated healthcare services side, we see solid demand. Our real world late phase business continues to be our fastest growing business unit. The commercial business, net new business continues to be lumpy, but in the U.S., approvals continue to be strong with 10 new molecular entities approved in the first quarter compared to eight in the first quarter of 2014. Across our segments, we're the healthy leaders with greater than $11 billion of backlog. We're also pleased with the collaboration across our business segments. As most of you know, getting a drug approved is only part of the battle; getting it paid for, or market access, is really key.
In addition, drugs that are approved on accelerated pathways require monitoring and collection of data in the "real world". I believe we're leading our industry in both of these areas and both segments are the leaders. Emerging biopharma in particular appreciates our full lifecycle support as it allows them to create more value for their shareholders. In late March, we announced the creation of a global clinical trials laboratory services joint venture with Quest Diagnostics. I'm really excited about this opportunity for both us and our customers.
The joint venture will enable biopharmaceutical customers to enhance their drug development processes. It will support precision medicine through companion diagnostics and build value by creating a more efficient effective organization through leveraging the size, the scientific expertise, and operational excellence of the parent organizations. We have received positive feedback from our customers on this transaction. We also had a solid quarter in our central laboratory new business.
We're working through the appropriate regulatory approvals and expect this transaction to close in the third quarter. In the meantime, both entities will continue to operate separately until the closing of the transaction. We will provide more financial details on this transaction after we close it.
We're also receiving some significant recognition during the first quarter including being named to Fortune's Most Admired Companies, Forbes' America's Best Employers and for the third time in four years the Best CRO at the World Vaccine Congress. We're really proud of growing into a Fortune 500 company and now being named as Most Admired and a Best Employer. These accolades highlight that Quintiles is moving beyond being a leader and just an interesting niche to a global leading company. Our recognized deep scientific expertise, technology, innovation and global work force continue to differentiate us in the marketplace.
Before closing, I'd like to share with you that after more than two years of leading Quintiles' Investor Relations, Karl Deonanan has been promoted and will assume the role of Senior Vice President of Finance for our Product Development segment. Karl has been a great Investor Relations leader, having relaunched the function within Quintiles as part of our IPO back in May 2013.
I'd also like to introduce Todd Kasper, a current member of the Quintiles team who has a strong background for the IR role as the new leader of our Investor Relations function. Please join us in congratulating both Karl and Todd on their promotions and welcoming Todd to the team. We greatly look forward to working with them and believe you will as well.
In closing, I'd like to recognize and thank the entire Quintiles global team of employees for their innovation, hard work and commitment.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Karl to begin the question and answers.
Karl Deonanan - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks Tom. We're ready to take questions. I would ask our participants to limit their questions to one to allow as many participants as possible to ask questions. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, hi. Good morning, and Karl congratulations on your promotion. We will miss you, enjoyed working with you. So my question here really focuses on the partnership with Quest and it's a two part question. First, if we can talk little bit in more detail about the feedback that you're receiving from your clients post the announcement of the partnership, and is this feedback relating only to Central Lab or you're also hearing views of plans around the potential benefit on the clinical side?
And then the second part of that question is more technical in nature, obviously you're going to guide to the financial impact once you close the transaction, but when we think about stuff like the Central Lab component, should we think about, you taking out the Central Lab contribution from above the line and putting it below the line? And what â and if that's the case, how should we qualitatively think about of the impact to margins?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Ricky, this is Tom. I'll answer the first part and I'll let Kevin go with the second part. We've been really pleased with the feedback from the customers so far, and interestingly, they just find the logic very clear.
We're the best clinical player with the deep medical and scientific expertise and they are the largest laboratory with the deepest operations expertise. Our globality, their focus in the U.S., their understanding of the diagnostic technologies, our understanding of getting them clinically validated, it just makes such sense to people that we do this and it's powerful. And the other thing that I'll say that I think our colleagues at Quest have emphasized, we just think this is a really efficient way to do this in terms of use of cash and use of our resources.
So more to come on this, I will tell you, it is one of the most exciting things happening in the industry and as we've spoken about, we've even had some interest from other CROs and potentially leveraging those capabilities over time.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Ricky, this is Kevin, good morning. To your question around geography on the P&L, we're â the JV have been structured such that we are the 60% owner of the JV or partner of the JV and as such we will consolidate the results of the entire lab JV into our financial results, the piece that would go below the line as you suggested would be the minority interest of the profitability related to a 40% that Quest would be attributed to Quest ownership, but in terms of margins, revenue, et cetera, it would be 100% consolidated into our results.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So really shouldn't â should not change kind of like the margin profile for Quintiles in terms of trajectory?
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. I guess my answer â we'll wait until we get a close to give more specific guidance, but clearly we see the benefits of the consolidation that we should see come through into our financial results. So we are expecting synergies associated with the combination of the two entities into the JV, but we'll give you a clear guidance on that once we know the timing of the closing and the impact for the year or so.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, thank you.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citi Group.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to focus a bit more on the product development ramp. Last quarter there were some start-ups and contracts that extended longer than anticipated and this quarter you decided just the ramping, maybe a little bit slower than previously anticipated, so could you just dig into that a little bit more maybe on what assumptions didn't hold and what's giving you confidence now?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Let me start with what's giving us confidence. I think we shared with you that we have about 15% more projects in what we call the start-up phase. So whenever you're doing a clinical development project, there are different phases to it, so this is the first phase after contracting. In general, what you're finding is the start-ups are a little bit slower than they've been due to more protocol amendments, the diseases and the pathways are a little bit more complex than they were, so there will be more interaction with regulatory agencies through that period of time. There may actually be more innovation associated with patient recruiting that's required.
And so, we're seeing a little bit slower start-up, but I think that 15% number, which is what Kevin and I look at is really the operating number demonstrates that the strong net new business that you've seen in the last number of quarters and especially our 1.45 this quarter and last quarter strong net new business are now starting to show up in our operating results and now what we need to do is bring them to revenues. So that's why we focus on the second half. I think consistent, Gary, with our comments at the end of the year, we knew the second half would be stronger than the first. But exactly what would happen in the first and second quarter, we're seeing play out in front of us now.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley of Jefferies.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
I wanted to ask a couple of questions around foreign currency impacts if I could. Just so, I think you have talked pretty frequently, year-to-date about a smaller impact to margin for the company in 2015 and 2014. We're starting off the year in the first quarter with a larger impact it looks like. So I wanted to kind of get the most up-to-date view on that.
Then I also wanted to understand the calculation, I guess, on the FX impact to bookings. I guess, I would have thought that because you signed those very, very recently that there would be pretty de minimis impact of FX on bookings, and so I'm confused by the swing factor on actual to constant dollar on bookings. Thank you.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. So, yeah, David, two really good questions, obviously I think if you look at slide nine of the presentation, foreign currency when you get to the adjusted income from operations line had about $4 million positive impact after having about a $59 million negative impact on revenue and that's split between the two segments. It's actually a negative impact in IHS and a slightly positive or obviously more positive impact on the product development side.
So we did see the continued weakening, particularly of the euro in the first quarter, which had a greater impact potentially than we had anticipated. If I go back to the three months ended last year and the same quarter last year, currency actually had basically no impact on revenue in the first quarter, but impacted our profitability by $10 million as a company.
So when I look at it from a real dollar perspective, currency actually contributed less this quarter than last quarter. But in terms of margin percentage, obviously it had a much greater impact on the negativity of sales which drove, I think, that margin percentage to a bit higher from a margin standpoint.
In terms of the revaluation, I guess, if you will, and your concern with the bookings, it's â remember as currency impacts things, it not only impacts what we book during the quarter, it also you have to value all of your existing backlog at the most currency, most recent currency rates also. So I have $11 billion plus of backlog, that when currency continues to change, we needed to revalue the entire foreign currency based backlog with that.
So that was the element that impacted. We made a slight change in the methodology associated with that to be sure that we're actual foreign exchange rates at the end of each quarter and that played through in what we talked about this morning.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
So can I just clarify so the â when you're distinguishing on net new business only, not the backlog, but net new business only and you're giving different numbers for actual and constant dollar growth, are you building in the revaluation of all of the backlog into that growth rate?
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes. So your bookings and your backlog I think are differentiated from one another, but all of the bookings are at the actual exchange rates that were recorded in the quarter.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Okay. I'll follow-up on that one.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So the 1.5 book-to-bill correlates with your revenue at the same exchange rates.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. Thank you.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
And Dave, I'm going to add one thing, Kevin actually had this in his remarks, I think it's important because we were chatting about this yesterday; this can be confusing because this foreign exchange impact is really dramatic. But let me just restate what he said, we added $316 million more of new backlog revenue burned, new backlog than revenue burned. This increase was offset by $496 million of negative foreign exchange revaluation. And just to put it in simple terms for the listeners, I mean it was a strong increase in backlog, but this FX, just to clarify things, we needed to make that adjustment. So I hope that helps.
David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC
Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks for the question. I guess just on the announcement of the refinancing today â I know you guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks Kevin, that you reevaluate all the time but I didn't see anything coming due near terms. So I'm just curious on the timing â and if you could maybe discuss a little bit, I know you mentioned the increase in the buyback authorization, but maybe if you could just discuss a little bit the prioritization in your mind given where you are with cash and leverage relative to buybacks.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure, let me first start with timing. Clearly we've seen the markets; the financing markets in particular improve and have been very strong. You're absolutely right, we don't have immediate maturities or current structure doesn't mature until 2018 â June of 2018, but opportunistically as you look at market conditions, the favorability of the market conditions, our ability to extend maturities long-term at a relatively lower cost and give us ourselves more flexibility in terms of other opportunities that we might want to do in terms of inorganic investment, acquisition, when you start talking about priorities, how we invest in our business, I think a new debt structure as we're proposing can position us very well for the long-term, give us great flexibility, maintains our leverage below three and a half times as we look at where we are.
So I think puts us in a good position from a leverage standpoint, flexibility from investment and growth, and to the extent we desire to do so, continue to return value to our shareholders. So the favorability of the market conditions today in advance of â one can speculate when rates go up, but it's a opportunistic time for us to really capitalize on I think favorable conditions.
Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's helpful, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
(34:51) very much. My question relates to the mix that you referred to within product development. Tom, I think I heard you say early in the call that you had a good mix in the quarter, but Kevin I think you mentioned that the service mix hurt margins in product development. Can you guys just clarify that? And is the mix shift that you're referring to just the higher proportion of start-up phase contracts, or are there some other dynamics at work here?
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Just to clarify, the mix benefit was in the net new business side. So as we talked about last year we had a couple of large renewals and some of those were in the functional resourcing area, et cetera, the net new business that we booked in the fourth quarter and here in the first quarter are much more favorable attractive mix of end-to-end clinical trial, fully integrated clinical business, which tends to carry greater margins. So what's going into backlog is of a higher quality mix.
In terms of revenue that we recorded in the first quarter, the mix was â there was a higher proportion of the lower margin, or lower functioning, a little bit less of the clinical as we said because of the cancellations that occurred in that area in 2014. In addition, you had the compounded mix of IHS growing at 20 plus percent and a much higher rate than product development. So that contribution, you saw they doubled their profits, which was really great from an IHS perspective, doubled their profits, improved their margins 300 basis points et cetera, but overall on a company that was a negative mix on the overall margins.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Understood. Thank you.

Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker of Raymond James.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of Novella's contribution to bookings this quarter, and how it compares to last quarter and the first quarter of 2014.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Let me take that one, Michael, it's Tom. I think â we don't disclose Novella specifically separately. But we did mention a number earlier that more than 50% of our new business was out of the top 20, which I think is a strong number for us. You know, it's interesting, we are more diversified than our competitors. We had last year, for instance, 14 companies that we did over $100 million of revenue with, and we continued to see that kind of diversity in our mix as we go to market.
So, as we move forward here, both Novella and our emerging biopharma offering, Novella tends to focus on the oncology, tends to focus on medical device, but also does some other high touch, more emerging biopharma works. It's been a great addition to our stable here. But then our own emerging biotech entity is also powerful and being well received by folks.
I was just at dinner on Monday night with emerging biotech who is growing very rapidly, who is very pleased with our traditional offering. I think in terms of the net new business, it is up dramatically for Novella over the last year and Kevin just put a number in front of me, as much as 40% up over last year, so you are seeing a real benefit from us taking a CRO that was an independent smaller CRO and then embedding it within our larger enterprise. I hope that helps.

Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to some of the comments you've made on product development, in particular around the mix shift dynamic. I mean as you're engaging in some of these more complex full service studies, can you maybe just help us think about the margin implications? You had a nice step-up in product development margins last year obviously. How should we be thinking about margin implications for that business this year just given the increasing complexity of the work you're doing? And then Tom, you called out changes in trial recruitment. Is that just more stratification of trials? Is that using expression analysis to genotype patients? I'm just curious as to what you're commenting on there.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Okay, sounds good. I think the â if you just â for folks to recall, we had a 1.59 book-to-bill in Q4 in product development and 1.45 this quarter. Both of those were very independent of any kind of functional resourcing. And for those of you who don't know our business that well, there is an element of all of this where it's a relatively lower margin piece that's functional resourcing and then a relatively high margin piece that's what we tend to call full service clinical.
So, we had â when we talk about the mix and it being attractive from a new business standpoint, those two numbers that are, together around 1.5 were both that very attractive mix. Now the challenge in our business, we can do this. We are a people-based business. And so when you have that kind of net new business, you do have to make sure you have the people to deliver the revenues, and you saw that impact in the margins in this quarter and you'll see it next quarter.
In fact, you'll actually see it out in Q3 and Q4 as well. But what we're expecting is that at that period of time, the revenue will start to be more clear on it. And the comments regarding the start-ups, yeah, there are a couple of things around it, but when you get to things like rare diseases, it is beneficial â you have to think of innovative ways to be able to recruit patients in those environments.
We also â you take an area like Alzheimer's, and now when we're looking at Alzheimer's, we're really trying to get a very specific set of conditions associated with, for instance, people who have Amyloid but who do not have cognition issues, and so there are certain scales that are used that are more technical. You also have in some of those studies for instance the addition of both PET scan and potentially even genomics and some other studies and even associated with Alzheimer's although you'll tend to have PET scan associated with the Alzheimer's work. And so you start thinking about those kinds of complications in recruiting and the whole thing is getting more sophisticated.
Now, the final comment I'll say though, is that in fact, as they get more complex, the value per patient to us goes up. So they're more complex, they're more service activities, we've quoted before the tough study 157% increase in procedures, which feels right to us. And so, it actually is a higher per patient cost. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color as we look at this. But it's â they are getting sophisticated, and we're well-positioned with this sophistication of our MDs and PhDs to help the customers through this.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Tycho, this is Kevin. I think Tom has exactly right there with the respect to margin ramp, et cetera. So I would just maybe add that we are making that investment that Tom talked about, the billable people are coming on board, we mentioned that for the first quarter. That does continue through the second quarter and the additions then kind of moderate out as we get to third and fourth. But with that revenue coming, we see those projects transitioning into those areas and we will see the margins come back much stronger in Q3 and Q4, more to what we're accustomed to seeing, so that is the expectation for the year.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then just one on the other side, you had a big step-up in IHS even excluding Encore. Can you comment on how much of that was Japan and maybe recovering North America versus other dynamics?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
It's very balanced, really. But North America is strong. I think â combination of what we're doing there in terms of our service offerings, the leadership, the global and North American leadership and then frankly, the attractiveness of the U.S. market in terms of innovative drug development is helping us.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And to your question there, it is very balanced. You've got North America and Japan strong as we've mentioned in our remarks, Tom just mentioned. But it is important to note that we did have this distribution agreement in Europe that we had a three-year agreement there that actually concluded at the end of last year, that was contributing nicely to revenue that is now out. So you saw despite the 20 plus percent revenue growth in the first quarter, there was an impact from that. But as we get into the second half of the year without that particular revenue, you will see as I said in my remarks, the growth rate in the overall IHS segment, most particularly commercial get back closer to market rates as opposed to the growth rates that we're enjoying in the first half with Encore being additive as well.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, good morning.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Derik.
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Derik.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. We've had a lot of incoming questions from investors asking what the role CROs will play in the emerging biosimilars market and yesterday the FDA issued three guidance documents for biosimilars approvals. I guess, how do you sort of view the biosimilars opportunity and what's been factored into your longer term guidance? How much â I guess, what's the upside potential?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's a great point, and it's a little more technical than we sometimes get it on these calls. But actually, what's happening with biosimilars is that they are becoming more of an opportunity for CROs than perhaps we expected or analysts expected a few years ago. And there's a few things that are driving this, one is the bioequivalency is a little more complicated than expected and so you are seeing an increase in the size of the studies that are taking place, associated with the biosimilars.
The other is that there are more companies playing than we might have expected. So instead of seeing two or three biosimilars, you might see five, six, or seven. And so, we're actually seeing this as a positive force in Phase I and obviously Phase III studies which is the two places that you tend to see it. And so, I think you'll â you should generally see in the CRO sector and in us, the positive impact of biosimilars.

Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI
Good morning, gentlemen. So I just want to go back on the bookings side. So again, if you look at the last several quarters relative to kind of your peers and industry, it certainly seems as if you guys are outpacing the market by a pretty notable fashion. And so as we think about the progression of that share gain, as you guys, I'm sure have dissected what your hit rates look like in different regions, parts of the business, sub-segments, where do you feel like you've been gaining the most momentum or do you feel like it really is broad-based and across all of the businesses, any kind of color you can point to on notable areas of out-performance would be helpful.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
It's interesting, Ross. It is broad-based and we continue to see large pharma using us, we work with all of the top 20. It's interesting in light of the Pfizer announcements, for instance, they continue to be an important customer and as we go forward. We're definitely up this â last couple of quarters in this quarter in emerging biotech and actually quarter-on-quarter, although we won't go in to details, is significantly up in terms of the emerging biotech piece of what's going on. So it's broad. I think the honest thing is, we just have a fantastic customer relationship management organization, because of our scale, we're able to dedicate people to larger customers and then we also have a segment of that that is filled with real strong drug developers in different therapeutic areas who frankly helped the customers with the complex programs that they're putting in place.
You take an area like Alzheimer's and â our people are incredibly knowledgeable of the patients, the sites, the ability to recruit in that area and you take some of these advanced immunotherapy compounds, we've been working with them and â again our oncologists are extremely capable in assisting customers. So I think some of that is just coming through and I have to say, as I look across the industry seeing our 1.59 last quarter, 1.45 and then last year having a 1.41 book-to-bill overall for the year in product development, I think we're really pleased with what it means for the next couple of years.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Security.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Kevin, I wanted to go back to the margin and just cut it a little bit differently, so if I kind of back in to what your guidance implies for margins, I think it's something about â call it 80 basis points of expansion over 2014, and in Q1 it looks like foreign exchange helped your margin by 110 basis points. And so I'm wondering, how much of that 80 basis point is really related to foreign exchange versus kind of the ramp in the back half of the year just from the way the business plays out?
Kevin K. Gordon - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
It's really going to be a combination of both, Tim. So I think â as we talked about when we adjusted the revenue guidance from constant currency growth rate where it is seventh to eighth, if I look at my margins now and I look at the continued mix that we're seeing between the segments particularly in the first half, that does have an impact on the overall growth.
We are â as Tom just mentioned and we did in our remarks â the first quarter has some investment in it with respect to head count ahead. Second quarter we expect to continue to see that trend. And as we get into second half, we'll see our constant currency margins improving, I think back up closer to levels where they were last year. But obviously you have that tailwind from the first half. So we'll have operating improvement and margin combined with â some element of foreign currency as rates stay where they are today as we go through the second half of the year.
We'll also have the continued element of the mix through the first half with IHS being much stronger. So the overall margins will be impacted by that mix element, with some improving constant currency from where we are in the first quarter through the Product Development segment. And then obviously, some benefit, additional benefit from the currency. So it's a combination of a lot of factors that are â all have to come together.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Maybe I can add, Tim. My angle is always a little different on this. I think the angle that I'd add is that Kevin and I have been implementing what we call global best practices around service delivery for a couple of years. And we're getting a bit of a double benefit here, because you lower the true constant currency cost of delivering work. And then, because of the strong dollar, right now we're actually getting a little extra benefit. And as we talked about before, we're in the middle innings of this. So there's more that we can do because of the size of our enterprise in terms of implementing the global best practices associated with processes and services which lower the cost of delivery. So we just happen to be getting a little bit of extra benefit because of FX right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good morning. Just a couple of technical ones. First off, head count, I believe disclosed it north of 33,000. I'm curious whether we could get an exact number on that if you have it available? And really what I'm driving to is just kind of goals and plans for hiring through the course of the year. I missed it if you delivered it. And I might have a quick follow up if possible.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
The number I have here in front of me is 33,200. So you're just about right on in terms of that. And to be honest with you, I'm going to give you our management approach. We are laser focused on trying to add only billable head count where we need to and non-billable head count to keep to a minimum. And because we think that's best for shareholders, best for us, so that's the way we think about it. We have a really strong group in our product development area who is looking at what we call supply and demand, and really trying to make sure that we match and don't exceed, but also don't under-deliver in that area. So I don't know, Kevin if we can go much further than that in terms of head count, but I think Kevin is saying that's about as far as we can go.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Got it, that's fine. And then on my follow-up if I can, I know we normally get the NTM coverage and backlog for kind of your visibility metric if you will, but I'm wondering if we can get it possibly a preview today, just so we have a sense on where that metric stands compared to recent history.

Your next question comes from the line of George Hill of Deutsche Bank.
Unknown Speaker
Hi, its Steven (54:36) on for George. My question was on the Central Labs. What do you see for the market growth rate in that segment? And what do you expect for your growth rate as part of the JV relative to that market growth rate?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, the general market growth rate we use is 4.5% to 5%, and as many know, that is almost â unlike the core clinical business, this is a almost entirely outsourced business. We are the second largest, and through the transaction we're going to benefit from more â really more size in that, more ability to buy reagents and other things more efficiently. And what our expectation is, to be perfectly honest with you, Steven, (55:22) is to outgrow the market growth like we do in other areas of our business.
Unknown Speaker
Okay. And just there are kind of the two large businesses in that market with your joint venture being one of them. What do you expect for pricing going forward?
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
There are a series of competitors, so for better or worse, that business does have a number of the other CROs, and a number of competitors and some competitors in Europe as well who tend to not get much publicity. But we do think that this will enable us to compete more effectively in the marketplace and that's going to be really, I think you've known us to have a leading set of test offerings and as we get more sophisticated biomarkers, the ability to develop assays, the ability to really add more sophistication to the esoteric side of the testing is crucial, and so we'll be able to do that. And at the same time in safety testing, it's getting increasingly really competitive and simplified so in safety testing we can get more efficiency. So the combination of the two ends up being a win for our customers.
Unknown Speaker
Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Kevin. So you guys mentioned last quarter you were seeing consistent with the increased funding for small biotech that that went up as a percentage of total wins pretty materially. Sounds like that was the case again in 1Q 2015 as well based on your comments a couple of minutes ago. So I guess really I'm just curious whether you think that trend will be sustained perhaps through the rest of 2015 just based on your crystal ball at the moment or is that still maybe a little bit less predictable? Thanks.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I guess, a couple things. I would also add that our win rates are up as well. So we've been looking at our percentage wins. So our win rates are up over the last couple of quarters, as well as that mix improvement that you point out.
In general, it's been interesting looking at the funding and I don't have the exact numbers. But we've seen numbers this quarter that were as high as 70% to 80% higher funding in the first quarter this year versus last year for emerging biotech. But some of you may recall that when we look at this, we actually â the amount of growth in the emerging biotech sector for our kind of work for clinical work is actually a fraction of that, because what happens is they get funded to a high degree and then over time they spend on clinical research.
So I do think that what you've seen over the last five quarters or so, and really almost two years now, does bode well for the longer term because we have the ability to â because that will come to us in tranches as opposed to being spent, as they're funded, they're all spent.
Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC

Your next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc Capital.
Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
So can you elaborate a little bit on sort of the cancellation experience in the first quarter in your net bookings? And maybe again, if you don't mind reviewing with us sort of the revenue recognition of these cancellations. I mean, does it â my impression was these cancellations impact revenues very quickly, but it seemed like the way you're guiding that there's sort of a lag from a cancellation to a revenue recognition.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, the cancellation â couple questions there. The cancellation rate in our product development segment, in particular, in the first quarter was relatively similar to the first quarter of last year. But actually a bit lower than we saw in the last couple quarters of last year. So it was actually reasonably in line with Q1, but down a little bit from the rest of the year.
To your question around cancellations and their impact, it really depends on the stage of the trial, where it is, how fast it impacts. If it's in a monitoring phase and there's activities going on in the trial that require us to continue to wind down the trial over a period of time, it will have less immediate impact. If it was a very early stage of a trial or we weren't into those activities, it can have a more immediate impact on revenue.
And particularly what we saw in the fourth quarter, those things that we took out were more immediate impact and as a result, that had the effect on revenue that you are seeing. So I think the good news, as you point out with your question is, the cancellations in Q1 were actually a bit lower.
And that to the question asked earlier, how we feel about our ability to deliver into the second half, assuming our pipeline continues to be strong, which it is and continuing to book the business the way we are, we have great confidence that the revenue comes back into those growth rates with those trends continuing.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bailin of Credit Suisse.
Jeffrey Emerson Bailin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. So we obviously got some visibility around capital deployment priorities with the expansion of your share repurchase program. But was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the M&A front and perhaps qualitatively what areas of the market maybe seem right for further consolidation or expansion.
Thomas H. Pike - Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, we â I'm glad you brought that up because, in fact, we do continue even with the program that Kevin described. We do continue to see opportunities for tactical tuck-in acquisitions and so we continue to look at it. We've had such success as we described earlier with both our real world late phase and our CRO acquisition of Novella.
We continue to look for geographically and therapeutically attractive CROs and then the other thing that we continue to look at is around the areas of market access and real world data, both data providers and analytic sources in particular.
I think you've heard us talk from time-to-time about our technology fairly specifically, and we're also looking in that area for the ability to supplement to really leverage the technologies that we developed over the last five years to seven years because we think there's probably more share holder and customer value that can be created out of that area too. So interestingly, with the capital deployment strategies, we think there still are key acquisition and given our balance sheet, we're able to deal with them. And maybe I'll make one last point on all of the debt financing. I think we just think it's a moment in time when you can combine short-term shareholder value with long-term shareholder value.
And those moments of time don't always happen, so we're going to look to see if we're exploring these possibilities. We can't commit that we can get through it obviously at this stage, but we do think it's one of those moments in time when we can satisfy shorter term and longer term shareholder value requirements and so we're going to try to do it.
