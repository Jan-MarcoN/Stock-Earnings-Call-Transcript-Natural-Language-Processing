Operator
Good morning and welcome to the TYCO Q3 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator instructions.) I will now turn the call over to Antonella Franzen, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Antonella Franzen
Good morning and thanks for joining our conference call to discuss TYCOâs Q3 results for fiscal year 2011 and the press release issued earlier this morning. With me today are TYCOâs chairman and chief executive officer, Ed Breen and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky.
I would like to remind you that during the course of the call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask you to look at todayâs press release and read through the forward looking cautionary informational statements that weâve included there. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.TYCO.com. Please also note that weâll be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes and average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items and this metric is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Let me quickly recap this quarterâs results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 10.5% year-over-year excluding the impact of electrical and metal products and organic revenue grew by 4%. The benefit of foreign currency contributed 6 percentage points to our overall revenue growth. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations attributable to TYCO common shareholders was $.76. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations before special items was $.85 representing an 18% increase year-over-year.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.
Ed Breen
Thanks Antonella. Good morning everyone. Overall this was a solid quarter for TYCO. Our results were strong in almost every area and we continue to strengthen our three core platforms while returning excess cash to shareholders.
On a total TYCO basis, our organic revenue growth picked up from the previous quarter and this combined with productivity initiatives resulted in a year-over-year operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. On a quarter sequential basis we saw revenue growth and operating margin expansion across all business segments. The steady growth of our recurring revenue base coupled with a 7% increase in orders and our continued focus on cost gives us confidence that we are well positioned for future growth.
Year to date we have announced strategic acquisitions across all three of our core platforms. Most recently we announced an agreement to acquire ChemGuard, a leader in developing and manufacturing specialty foams and other fire suppression chemicals. ChemGuard is a nice tuck in to our fire protection products business and further expands our product and service offerings in the fire suppression market.
Additionally we further increased our R&D efforts and ramped up our investments in sales and marketing. Year-over-year we have increased our R&D spend by 18% and our sales and marketing spend by 7% in Q3.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of our businesses and then Frank will provide you with more details. Starting with security we had another solid quarter. Growth and recurring revenue was driven by higher average revenue per user coupled with continued growth in the customer base which now exceeds 9 million accounts.
On the non-recurring revenue side we have now lapped a year of quarterly organic revenue growth and continued to see good top line expansion despite the (inaudible) compare. Securities operating margin continued to expand year-over-year with improvement in all geographic regions.
Turning to fire, organic revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by increased service and product revenue. Stronger sales, selectivity of installation projects and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives resulted in very strong operating margin performance.
In flow control organic revenue turned slightly positive in the quarter after two years of organic decline and order activity within our valves and our thermal businesses continues to be robust. The recent increase in orders for valves is now converting to higher revenue and we are seeing the expecting leverage of 35% reflected in our operating income.
Now let me turn the call over to Frank to discuss our operating results in more detail.
Frank Sklarsky
Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions overall revenue for the quarter grew 13% to $2.2 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Recurring revenue, which represents 57% of total revenue, continues its positive momentum with 5% organic growth in the quarter. Growth across the globe was led by North American residential and small business operations. Weâre also pleased that the EMEA region grew recurring revenue organically for the second quarter in a row.
On the non-recurring revenue side organic growth first turned positive a year ago after eight consecutive quarters of decline. During this yearâs Q3 non-recurring revenue grew 4% organically with contributions from each geographic region. From a profit perspective, securities operating income and margin before special items also improved and were slightly above what we had expected. Operating income before special items was $358 million and the operating margin increased 170 basis points over the prior year to 16.5%. The improvement was due to growth in recurring revenue including the benefit of the Broadview acquisition, the continued benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives and increased volume in the commercial business.
From a regional perspective with insecurity, let me start with our North American residential and small business operations where nearly 90% of revenue is recurring. Organically recurring revenue in North America grew 5% in the quarter driven by an increase in the number of accounts and higher average revenue per user. The operating margin improved year-over-year as incremental investments in sales and marketing were more than paid for by the increase in recurring revenue. Our North American residential account base now stands at 6 million customers, a more than 1% increase from the prior year. Average revenue per user grew just over 3% year-over-year mainly due to the favorable impact of higher monthly revenue rates from new accounts including pulse. Our residential attrition rate of 12.8% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis.
In our North American commercial business organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter driven by increased activity and non-recurring system installation and service which comprises about 60% of the commercial revenue. Orders increased 7% year-over-year driven by Retrofit and upgrade work.
In the EMEA region we continued to see modest top line growth. The benefits of past restructuring actions and cost containment initiatives drove the 11.8% operating margin in the quarter.
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions where revenue is predominantly commercial in nature, organic revenue grew 8% on a combined basis with continued improvement in the operating margin year-over-year.
Turning now to some of our key metrics for our overall global recurring revenue security business, our worldwide account base grew 2% year-over-year to over 9 million accounts. In addition to growing our account base, our global average revenue per user also increased to $46.30 representing a 3% increase year-over-year excluding currency effects. The average revenue per user has been steadily increasing as a result of our broader product offerings. Our total worldwide attrition rate of 12.7% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and remains steady on a quarter sequential basis.
And finally, security products, which includes intrusion, video and access control had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q3. Iâd like to point out that this piece of the business is where much of our security technology is developed and over the last three quarters weâve been increasing our investment in R&D. we plan to continue to increase our investment in technology to provide an even more extensive portfolio of security product offerings.
Let me quickly comment on Broadview and Signature Security. Weâve now lapped the one year anniversary of the Broadview acquisition and are pleased to report that we are tracking to the synergies we expected to achieve.
Signature Security closed during Q3 and the integration plan, which is similar to Broadviewâs is well under way. Although purchase accounting adjustments are a bit dilutive to earnings initially, we have identified cost synergies that will enable this acquisition to become accretive in the near term.
Let me now turn to fire protection. Overall revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion with organic revenue growth of 5%. Our service and systems installation business, which is the largest piece of fire protection, reported total revenue of $859 million. Service revenue grew 5% organically in the quarter. Systems installation was relatively flat on an organic basis as growth in North America and Asia-Pacific offset a decline in EMEA due to selectivity of installation work. The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products, which encompasses the fire protection products and life safety businesses, reported revenue of $341 million in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%.
I would also like to quickly comment on the acquisition of ChemGuard that we announced last week. This acquisition expands our fire suppression offerings and provides greater penetration into certain end markets, particularly the petro chemical and oil and gas verticals. From a financial perspective ChemGuard is a very attractive acquisition with a purchase price reflecting a mid-single digit multiple. Similar to the other parts of our fire products business, ChemGuard also has a strong operating margin profile and this along with several synergy opportunities that have been identified will allow this acquisition to be quickly accretive to earnings. The ChemGuard transactionâs expected to close by the end of the calendar year subject to anti-trust clearance and other customer closing conditions.
Turning back to the results of our overall fire segment, operating income before special items was $158 million in the quarter and the operating margin was 13.2%. As we discussed with you last year, the operating results in the prior year Q3 were positively impacted by an $8 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which increased buyers operating margin by 80 basis points. Adjusting for this prior year pension benefit, the year-over-year operating margin increased 140 basis points. Increased leverage from higher volume in the fire protection and life safety product businesses along with an increased mix of service revenue across all regions drove the year-over-year operating margin improvement. Year-over-year (inaudible) growth of 2% included 5% growth in service, 9% growth in fire products and a 5% decline in systems installation which was related to the project selectivity.
A similar player backlog of $1.26 billion was flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving to flow control, revenue on $928 million was slightly better than we expected. This was driven largely by the thermal business where a few large customers accelerated the installation phase of their projects during Q3 and this more than offset a shortfall on water revenue. Operating income before special items was $106 million and the operating margin was 11.4% which was a little short of our guidance due to lower than expected operating margin in water. The balance in controls, which comprises about 60% of flow controlâs annualized revenue, grew 8% organically in the quarter. A very good improvement from the 1% growth we saw in Q2. The sequential increase in revenue to $575 million leveraged at the anticipated 35% incremental profit. This drove a 200 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. Orders in (inaudible) also continued to accelerate in the quarter with 15% year-over-year growth, indicating strength in all end markets, particularly in oil and gas and power.
In thermal controls organic revenue growth of 23% was driven by strong project activity during the quarter and we continue to see strong project activity in thermal as orders grew 30% year-over-year. In water, organic revenue declined 31% with more than half of the decline attributable to the completion of the Australian desale project earlier this year.
In addition, the current absence of large scale pipeline projects has reduced margins in water for the mid single digit range from a historical range in the mid-teens. We are however pursuing several large projects which are currently in the bidding phase and for which TYCO is a strong contender.
Weâve made a deliberate decision to maintain our infrastructure of expertise and manufacturing capabilities as we look to book these projects beginning in a Q2 of next year. This should result in improved operating results in water in the second half of fiscal 2012. Overall flow orders in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year and backlog of $1.75 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis.
Now let me spend a few minutes on our expectations for Flow Control in Q4. As noted on slide 10 of the review materials, we expect flow control revenue before the contribution from the KEF acquisition to be approximately $1 billion, a 6% organic revenue increase year-over-year. From an operating income perspective we expect the sequential revenue increase to drive 26% incremental operating income for total flow as the expected leverage in valves controls and thermal is partially offset by the previously described near term dynamics in the water business. This will result in a Q4 operating margin before the impact of the KEF acquisition of approximately 12.5%. The acquisition of KEF, which closed at the beginning of Q4 is expected to contribute approximately $30 million of revenue. Non-cash purchase accounting adjustments which are typically higher in the first few months after acquisition are expected to impact Flow Controlâs operating margin in Q4 by about 150 basis points. Flow Controlâs overall reported revenue is expected to be $1 billion $30 million with an all-in operating margin of approximately 11%.
Now Iâd like to touch on a few other important items. First corporate expense before special items was $102 million in the quarter, which is quite favorable versus our original estimate. This is mostly due to lower adjustments required for actuarial evaluations, which were completed in the quarter as well as the timing of certain project related expenditures which will be incurred in Q4. We expect corporate expense in Q4 to be approximately $110 million bringing our full year expense to slightly below the low end of our previous guidance of $400 million to $420 million. This revised amount represents a reduction of approximately $50 million or 10% as compared to the previous year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 13.9%. The tax rate in Q3 was favorable impacted by the timing of the resolution of certain pre-separation tax liabilities. We expect the Q4 tax rate to be about 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16%.
Lastly, our cash and overall balance sheet remains strong. This provides us the flexibility to continue to invest organically in our businesses, make strategic blot on acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders.
Now let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morningâs call and then weâll move into the Q&A session.
Ed Breen
Thanks Frank. Now let me turn to our guidance for Q4 and our revised outlook for the full year. For Q4 we expect revenue of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. The overall operating margin in Q4 should be similar to what we achieved in Q3 as the improvement in security and fire will be partly offset by non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and sequentially higher corporate expense. Below the line we expect and operating loss of $8 million related to our minority interest in ad core and as Frank just mentioned, an 18% tax rate in Q4. We therefore expect our EPS before special items in Q4 to be about $.85. Based on our Q4 guidance we now expect full year EPS from continuing operations before special items to be approximately $3.17 which is a $.10 to $.15 per share increase from our previous guidance.
Thanks for joining on the call and operator if youâd open up the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions.) Our first question today is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein
Maybe I could just start with the beat insecurity in the performance there. If I recall when you first announced the Broadview Brinks acquisition, you were thinking about $50 million which I recall being about $.78 at the time translating additionally in the second year of the acquisition. I know you commented that you were sort of on track but maybe you could tell us how much of the currency was due to Broadview Brinks and what your, you know, quantify a little bit for us how you are tracking relative to that and then maybe later on where the additional acquisitions get you.
Ed Breen
Itâs kind of high level on Broadview. Weâre probably about 75% through after the one year mark beginning the synergies. So we got about 100 million operationally that weâve got baked in already, itâs happened. If youâll remember there was about 50 million of one time items that improved our numbers also on the synergies which was the re-branding going away and the royalty payment back to the Brinks parent going away. So that was about another 50 million. So thatâs 150 that weâve already kind of put in the bag. And then thereâs 50 million on the tax line that weâre getting most of it as we get through this year and into the beginning of next year. So net-net I think by the time we actually end this fiscal year, weâll be a good 80% to 85% of the way through the synergies on Broadview and the rest will happen in the beginning of next year. As we mentioned, itâs EPS accretive to us on a year run rate basis of at least $.10. I think weâre probably going to come in a little bit better than what we had planned. And also remember on a cash basis itâs more like $.18 per share accretive. So I think itâs going very, very well. Just in tracking slightly ahead of where we had projected, both a little bit on dollars and a little bit on timing.
I would mention what I like about the signature security acquisition, again much smaller in nature but weâre basically using the playbook from the Broadview integration. You know itâs almost identical. We bought a security company with accounts, a field sales force installation team and weâre really doing the exact same integration process and weâve actually used some of our North American talent to help structure the synergy, a roll forward on the signature piece. I fell very good that weâll get that very quickly accreted to earnings. But because of the size Iâd say itâs a penny or two when you look at next year on that.
The one Iâm really personally focusing on is the KEF acquisition which we just closed on in the Middle East. We have a lot of cost synergies there as you know because weâre going to load up the foundry with a lot of product to get the absorption rate way up so weâre just beginning that process. Thatâs very important that we track on to that one because that has a lot to do with the cost side of making these numbers work. But what Iâm more excited about is the growth opportunity in that market. And we are going to expand with that base in the Saudi Arabia during fiscal 12 with our own facility, our own plant and all. So weâre both focused on the cost side of that one and the revenue potential of that one going forward.
And I would point out without the two customer names, weâve won two awards over the last 30 to 45 days since people knew we were buying KEF from KEF relationships where we won a little over $30 million in orders because of the relationships that they had. But these were actually orders for TYCO valve products that weâre getting. So that was a nice start on that.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein
Great. You also mentioned productivity initiatives a couple of times and thatâs nothing that youâve been as vocal about historically. Do you either have a way of, I donât know if you can quantify that or give us a sense for what kind of magnitude we should thinking about; whatâs different on the productivity front versus what you had been doing or what results youâre maybe getting.
Ed Breen 
Well let me just give you a high level. You know last year we did 150 some million of restructuring two-year type paybacks so you can extrapolate that into this yearâs numbers. This year our restructuring by the way will be a little bit lower which weâll mention then we had thought because weâre not going to do some restructuring in the water business that we were planning on. And so weâre going to maybe come in around another $140 million to $150 million this year restructuring again with about a two year payback which kind of rolls into next yearâs numbers on the upside. And then the bigger issue is I think we mentioned this on the last call. We are looking at a three to three and a half year project to take about another $500 million of cost out of the company. It mostly comes out of the G&A line. As you can see weâre ramping up R&D, weâre ramping up sales and marketing but our G&A structure weâre going to make the last big push here over the next few years and thatâs where weâll get a lot of this productivity. Itâs mostly back office functionality being tied together in the regions around the world. And so thatâs our big focus as we enter 2012.
Now by the way when we get that 500, this is not exact but the way I look at it, a good half of that will drop to the bottom line of the company just from taking the cost actions. The other half of that money will probably be spent on growth initiatives. However they should also have a nice payback to them or we wouldnât do them. So thatâs the way I would look at that.
Antonella Franzen 
And Steve the one thing I would add to that when you think of this $400 million to $600 million of savings and all the restructuring that weâve done over the years, if you kind of take a look at it in the past a lot of the restructuring has been within the segment and individually within the segments in improving the operations there and now this kind of stretches across all three platforms.
Frank Sklarsky 
Right and the only other part Iâd add on productivity specifically is when you look at whatâs happened with the nice secretion, the medium margins in security and what the accretion and the margins and the fire business, a lot of that is attributable to some of the productivity and efficiency initiatives along with some of the mixes we got in terms of adding additional components of service and so on.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein
Okay and last question for me is one I raised on. Prior calls, a little different this time, which is a lot of the guys, the CEOs at our conference and elsewhere from some of the cable and phone companies have been talking increasingly aggressively about their security monitoring plan. And itâs different now then it used to be just in terms of how public and how much louder theyâre being about it. I mean has you perspective on that changed at all?
Ed Breen 
No it hasnât. And nothingâs happening that we werenât thinking was happening and thereâs no new news to us. But obviously remember weâre in the business and we talk on a weekly basis with people we compete with, people that we partner with and people we might partner with. So weâre in constant dialogue with everyone. But no Steve, I feel the same way about it. Iâve always, as I said, been a believer that weâll have a couple entrants here that are going to give a go at this. I think we do very well in that environment. I will point out to you that weâve been competing with a couple very big brand names for almost a year now in markets that theyâve really been trying to see how they can do in these markets. We track ourselves in those given markets and our metrics are no different in those markets then how they are tracking across North America.
And by the way, a little bit how I would view it also is we had a big branded player that we competed with before which was a phenomenal name in Brinks and to some extent a little bit of extra advertising in the market and someone else talking about security and advertising and all is not a bad thing. I will also add we constantly talk to people about should partner, should we not. Thereâs a lot of conversations going on in the industry that could potentially be interesting. But no other news besides that comment at this time.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein
Okay. And since you mentioned those test markets, thereâs no major pricing deterioration from those other players?
Ed Breen 
No. You know when you look at it youâve seen maybe some people talk about their pricing. Remember when you look at it you gotta get it apples to apples and when you get it kind of a true apples to apples the pricing is very close for everyone that is at least talked about pricing. Iâll give you one little tidbit for instance. In our pricing right now on our pulse package, we put in there our quality service package as standard where in the past we always just made that an option. That happens to be $5 per month that we get in the package. But some of the other people that have talked about their pricing, thatâs not there. So I think what youâll see over time is a little bit like what I would call the satellite and the phone and cable guys. They all do introductory prices and then they talk you up. Here do you want this in your package, do you want this? And my gut is weâll do more and more of that. Quite frankly weâve been doing that but weâll do more and more of that to get people interested at certain price points and then move the packages up like we do now.
Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein
Great Thanks. Iâll hand it on.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays Capital.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital 
Just to follow up on ADT, could you give us a little bit of an update on where we stand on the take rate on the Pulse packages, some of that commentary you sort of provided down at EPG on take rates and which package customers were going for?
Ed Breen 
Let me read you across kind of the three quarters here since we launched again. We had a 14.5% take rate for Pulse in Q1 of this year. We had 15.5% take rate in Q2. We had 19.5% take rate in the quarter we just ended. July is running a little bit over 20 right now but weâre only a few weeks into it. But whatâs interesting here, let me give you Q1 and Q3 on mix. Iâll just give you two of the packages. The introductory package which is select, thatâs the lowest level package. In Q1 it was an 84% take rate. And the premiere package which is the high one was a 10% take rate. In the quarter that just ended, Select was a 74% take rate, so 10 points lower. But the Premier has a 23% take rate up from 10. So you can see the mix is skewing also to some extent to the higher end. And as Iâve said for the last few quarters when we talk, thatâs just the maturing of the sales force learning how to move people up the food chain. Understanding how to market it and sell it. So that puts our average still just around $50 a month on ARPU for Pulse accounts versus our new accounts X-Pulse are about $43 as we bring them on. And our Heritage install base is $36. So just to give you a feel for this.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital 
So remind me, is the dealer network actually selling ADT Pulse now?
Ed Breen 
No theyâre not. A couple of them have just begun offering the select package and weâre just being very cautious, making sure theyâre trained well. I would just ball park you that by the time we get to the end of our fiscal Q4, weâll maybe have a third of them up and running by the end of the calendar year, a high percentage of them.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital
So just to clarify, these numbers are just for the internal sales force.
Ed Breen 
Yes. And the way I would maybe look at that is just by pure numbers thatâs about half our sales force.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital
Okay and just one last question on the orders. Hard to argue with a nice 7% order growth in the quarter but you put the April number up previously up 10%, can you just sort of walk through what happened in the last few months of the quarter to bring that order rate down?
Ed Breen 
Yeah, let me see if I can actually pull the exact number. Because I know April was higher, May was a little lower and June was up again if I remember. But I want to get the exact number for you here.
Antonella Franzen
Let me just remind you that when we started off the previous quarter was kind of along the same trend as well. So I wouldnât focus too much on any one particular month within a quarter.
Ed Breen
Yeah just to give it to you but when you look at this, I really do, what Antonella was point out, it depends on the lumpiness and flow, by the way, because of the way you get the orders. But we were 10% in April, we were 4.3% in May and we were about 6.5% in June.
Frank Sklarsky
Some of that of course has to deal with the absolute amounts from the previous year. So when you look at the absolute order rate, theyâre still very strong through the quarter.
Ed Breen
Yeah and let me point out through three weeks through July our orders are tracking right about 7% which is the same as the last two quarters of orders as you can see on the chart we put in the package.
Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research
Thank you. Ed can you elaborate a little bit more on kind of how and when you go out to this $500 million of cost benefit. You have been talking about it for a few months. Are you still trying to evaluate how actually to attack it and can you give us a sense of is it a complex ERP effort, is it one of the one or two kind of bigger things that are the challenges that youâre trying to get right there.
Ed Breen 
Yeah Jeff, youâre right on the point. This is an ERP consolidation across the platforms to bring it down to literally a few in the company. And let me just take you back to I guess around the time of separation into the three TYCO companies. I know these numbers will sound staggering but we worked our ERP systems down globally to about $300 at that time. We are now down to 130 ERP systems and weâre going to go down to about five. So the 130 down to the five is the next three year progression. And the other big piece of that is weâre putting in a consolidated HRF system so the two big pieces are ERP and the global HR systems and weâre taking that down to a single platform. And then when we do all that or as we do all that, we take the G&A structure of the company down.
Frank Sklarsky
And the only thing I would add to that is weâve got a lot of legal entity complication from the legacy. That has already been reduced by several hundred. We have another few hundred legal entities to come out and when you do that you can consolidate locations, hub and spoke approach and center of excellence approach on some of the shared services across HR, IT and finance. So we have a really good location consolidation opportunity, a legal entity opportunity which by the way reduces administrative costs in the area of cost filings and other administrative costs. All of that is a big piece of this. So itâs three functions, itâs ERP, itâs legal entity, itâs consolidation tools and leveraging the horizontal pipes across the organization. So weâre underway now. It will accelerate as we get into 2012 in terms of the activity.
Ed Breen
Yeah and maybe to punctuate that, to put the burden on us, this is a topic we presented to our board at our last board meeting and told them that weâre committed to these numbers. You can track us against them and this will be a launch for fiscal 2012 for the next three years.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research 
And then I understand some of this, although it overlays corporate, does back up into the segments. But just thinking about the corporate expense line which we all can kind of clearly see, should we take it to mean that that number permanently at least has a three handle on it now and --
Ed Breen 
Yeah I would say yes weâre in the high threes run rate now. As you can see from like 450 the previous year. And again Iâm just gutting this right now, we havenât pinned down the exact numbers but thereâs another $10 million or $15 million of it weâre going to try to get out of the corporate number.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research
And then just finally for me, I appreciate it. Thank you. On deals it does seem like things are picking up. None of them are particularly large so itâs kind of what you were saying previously about size but can you give us some color on what we can expect going forward and what the pipeline looks like, what kind of things youâre looking at.
Ed Breen 
You mean as far as bolt on acquisitions? Yeah, look we kind of earmarked $500 million from kind of the last earnings call that we had three months ago. We had done $500 million or so the year before. The ChemGuard one we just announced is a piece of that new 500, you know. So give or take. My gut is weâll do three or four deals during the year that would bring the total to about the 500. And weâre really looking, as you can see what we just did during the last month, we really are looking across all three platforms. I would say the thrust is maybe two areas of, if you want to look at it this way, one is technology that we might want to bring in that fills in something in the portfolio and geographic reach mostly emerging market like the KEF deal that we did.
Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research
Alright. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Inch with Merrill Lynch.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Just to be clear, you thought that about $20 million of Australian flooding revenue was going to come this quarter? It sounds like that didnât actually happen or did it? Iâm just curious what, you know --
Ed Breen 
About two thirds of it did come through in the quarter. But when you look at flow we did put a chart out, I think it was page ten in the package this morning. That piece of it did come back but we did fall a little bit short on the water side during the quarter so maybe to your question itâs maybe hard to see. But we did get those shipments. We missed on some other things on the water side.
And what I would point out on that chart when you look at it, as Frank said on the call, we made a very deliberate decision in Q3 to hold onto our overhead in the water business. Itâs the only part, if you look at flow the valves are really booming right now and weâre getting great fall through. We are getting very solid business opportunities in thermal which look really good over the next few years. As you can see our orders were up 30%, thatâs a good margin business. Our only weak spot here was water and what we were going to do in Q3 was downsize in the business but weâve been waiting and waiting because we now have three large water projects that are on the horizon here. We are actually feeling very good about our position on these three projects and they are three fairly decent size projects that would last for multiple quarters. And so we made a decision just to hang on the overhead because a lot of this is in Australia, itâs a tight labor market, we canât get rid of the people and then do a ramp on these three major programs so we think those orders start hitting in Q2 so we just made a decision to eat through a little bit of pain on the water margins for a couple quarters here to get the real benefit for multiple quarters going forward. Iâd say thatâs the dynamic there.
Frank Sklarsky
And by the way, in any given quarter where weâre off just a little bit on the revenue side in water versus the asset, it can be sometimes nothing more than site readiness or the case over which the shipments make it to the site and then are properly revenue recognized. And that was a piece of what would happen on Q3 versus where we thought weâre gonna be just a couple months ago.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
And it sounds like the restructuring that you had contemplated was overhead purely, right? This was not some sort of capacity issue. Because that wouldnât make sense if youâre actually seeing the business improve.
Ed Breen 
Right. It was overhead. But when you look at it, itâs a lot of technical expertise, field installation expertise. Remember when we win these big water projects, besides valves and other products, we lay a lot of pipe. Which we like that business and so you canât get rid of all this infrastructure and think youâre gonna ramp on three major programs quickly. So thatâs the decision that we made.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Whatâs the outlook for the tent business Ed or Frank? I realize you donât, you know, youâve pulled up the part of it but just thinking about the dynamic of the non-ready construction markets today and the tie in there. I think we had been expecting some sort of an improvement under the coming quarters. Iâm just wondering is your thought process changed a little bit towards that expected contribution?
Ed Breen 
No, not at all. In fact though I still chuckle about it. Last quarter they had great spreads going on. Spreads now are contracting a little bit which is why weâll see a little bit of this loss when we put the Q4 guidance out. But you know just going back to the underlying point, this business is very non-ready focused and that market from its peak is down darn near 65% to 70%. So that is still bouncing along a bottom. But as that picks up, the tent business obviously will improve very nicely off of a very significant bottom. So they can make decent money even in this environment as we showed and they did last quarter. But thatâs still based on no activity really on the new construction on the non-resi side.
And just as an overall comment to TYCO since we have exposure to the commercial markets, as we said last quarter, we are not counting on any lift whatsoever from new construction in North America or Europe to hit until the middle of next year. Thatâs how we planned. So the orders weâre seeing right now, the momentum weâre seeing is really a lot of retro fit and upgrade work. And then I think the last late cycle for us to come back, which is really late cycle obviously here is this commercial piece.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Right. Well that makes sense.
Frank Sklarsky
Remember too in the tent business as the non-resi markets do recover, those same conditions will also tend to increase the commodity prices so youâll get the benefit of the non-resi recovery and the spread on the steel at the same time. So theyâll be a lot of tailing when it inevitably happens.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Just lastly you know I heard an add on the radio dialing a 1-866 number for ADT offering free equipment installation if you sign a three year contract. Iâve heard a couple of these and itâs not clear to me; is this a dealer or is this TYCO doing this? Because I thought you guys had actually suspended that program.
Ed Breen 
Itâs probably one of the dealers John. Weâre not doing that in our ads.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Youâre not, thatâs what I assumed. Okay great.
Frank Sklarsky
Just remember also when you do see ads you get a lot of calls in and the sales thing is hey hereâs what you really want in your package. So you know thatâs the goal. Thereâs industries that have proven very successful in that as we have and you end up at very different price points.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
But you donât absorb any of those costs in any way Iâm assuming, right?
Frank Sklarsky 
No, not at all.
John Inch - Merrill Lynch
Okay great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
Just to clarify a couple of the numbers here, so the electrical and metal losses and then the dilution from the deal, that equals what, like $.04?
Antonella Franzen 
For Q4? Youâre at about $.03 and $.04, yup.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
Okay. And then the revenue guidance for Q4, if you strip out, youâve given us flow control and if you look at the sequential increase at the low end of the range at least, 2% seems pretty low. You did 4% ex flow in Q4 of â09 and 7% in Q4 of 2010. Is there any reason why this seasonality would be incrementally weaker here in Q4?
Ed Breen 
No, no, and we donât think it will be. Our organic growth rates, maybe weâll go through this offline with you also, but is in the 4% to 5% range which is slightly above what we did in Q3. So, no, weâre expecting that improvement.
Frank Sklarsky
And by the way, this might actually go to both your questions and the one right before it, when you just look sequentially from Q3 to Q4, maybe to do the math, the operations are improving by $.08 sequentially. And then we have the offset as we mention on tax being a little bit higher sequentially and corporate and other. And purchase accounting is in there also because of the deal. So we did $.85 in Q3, weâre guiding to approximately that for Q4 but in there the operations are having a nice lift and then bottom line offsets.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
Right. And your point on corporate from before is that even though it was maybe a little bit lower then expected this quarter, that is a sustainable low number that is going lower so that is not a one time benefit so to speak.
Ed Breen 
Right. And I think, I know we bounce around below the line on items the way you gotta count for things but when you look at the macro issue, corporate came down $50 million this year and weâre saying we can ease it down a little bit more so the run rateâs coming down. And weâve had great tax work this year so I know tax bounces around also. But now when you look what weâre guiding to the full year at, weâre guiding, you can see, with an 18% in Q4, it puts the full year at around 16 which is very nice progress.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
Maybe I should spin out the tax department, they do a great job. They probably get high multiple. Just on the segments here for Q4, maybe just give us an idea of, I mean youâre basically saying kind of flattish margins so that would be, but youâve given us flow, that would be kind of implied for the other two. Thereâsâ nothing kind of bouncing around in the other two segments right, in security and fire?
Ed Breen 
No. I think what youâll see, similar margins in maybe security, maybe slightly better than where we were and slight improvement in fire also sequentially. But thatâs off of a higher number that we did in Q3. We had a very nice Q3 as you can see in fire.
So youâll see a little bit of momentum on the margins in those businesses, you know, as you move in Q4.
Frank Sklarsky
And with fire, the good story there is the gradual improvement will be enabled by this continued make shift to service. So we talked about the selectivity installation business as they focused a lot on service that typically carries higher margin and is more sustainable over time. That trend will continue over time.
Ed Breen
Thatâs why when weâve given you the mix, I think itâs important to look at that, the aggregate fire orders is one thing but over the next year still youâre going to see this ship as youâre seeing, weâre, if you look across the year, thereâs no growth in systems install because weâre walking away from some verticals we donât want to participate in from an install standpoint. So weâre muting our overall growth a little bit but when you look you can see nice growth service, nice growth on the product businesses and that whole mix shift Frank just mentioned is really playing out in that margin progression that weâre having.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
Okay one more question just on play. You gave us a sequential kind of incremental margin of about 26%. You know if you start to get some of these bigger water projects and you cover a little bit of that overhead better, should we think about 25 as kind of the baseline type of conversation for flow as we kind of look forward into the next year or so? And then that maybe could even improve as the water margin begins to come back?
Antonella Franzen 
Itâs hard to say on a quarter-by-quarter basis because you have to remember 60% of flowsâ revenue is a project based business so it could be choppy from quarter to quarter. But on average I would say itâs not a bad way to think about it. But itâs not going to be an exact number every quarter.
Ed Breen
But a large project could have a two handle on it in terms of incremental drop depending on the project. But clearly as we said in the script, as you get into mid next year, once we book some of these large orders, hopefully in Q2, youâll start to get that accretion from that mid single digit rate back up to where we were trying to get historically. So that should play out.
Frank Sklarsky
The good thing right now that, believe me weâre watching it everyday, Iâm not naive to watch what other people are talking about on their earnings calls but when I look at the flow business right now, what weâre seeing is you can tell nice order momentum and to Frankâs point that doesnât count any of our framing agreements that weâre working on that could be pretty substantial for us. And I think I mentioned on the last earnings call we expect that we would book one or two of them in a six month window which is now a three month window. And I do think thatâs an accurate comment still. So that can layer in on this to really, could be very nice for us going forward.
Steve Tusa - JP Morgan
So really the best is still to come at flow it feels like. Itâs still accelerating pretty nicely.
Frank Sklarsky
Yes, absolutely I think. The orders now have built for six quarters in a row in the business, and by the way, the leverage we got on the valves is exactly 35%. We were very impressed by our forecasting capability. So thatâs very nice and obviously that plays into next year with the momentum weâre seeing.
Steve Tusa â JP Morgan
Alright, thanks a lot.
Operator
Your next question is from Ajay [Kajirival] with FBR.
Ajay [Kajirival] â FBR
Thank you, good morning. First just on ADT margins, last couple quarters have seen very solid improvement helped by RPUâs and all the good work in the costs. But maybe update us on the R&D and SG&A there and what are your expectations as you ramp, and how should we think about margins from here?
Ed Breen
Youâll still see margin expansion in the business but that margin expansion comes from I would say three big buckets: the continued improvement in the mix on the resi business, as we keep bringing RPU up and therefore our IRRs are going up in the business. So thatâs one spot. Continued recovery in the end market in the non-recurring: remember my comment a minute ago about the steel business. We are seeing a pickup but that has nothing to do yet with any real new non-commercial construction. So youâve got to think at some point as weâre into next year weâll see a little bit of lift that helps us on that, and just the continued improvement in that business.
And then the third big bucket is the point about the restructuring that weâre on, the $500 million or so. A big chunk of that obviously would fall into security because of the size of our security business. So to me itâs drive the resi business hard, that continues to improve margins; drive the growth rate of the commercial business and really that whole mix issue there, and then drive the restructuring or the simplification initiative are the three big buckets.
Frank Sklarsky
This goes back to what I was saying before about taking savings on the G&A categories and reinvesting them into what we call S, or selling and marketing and R&D, and thatâs exactly the dynamic that weâre going to be seeing over the next couple quarters and we have seen in the security business where you see op expense, pure and kind of general administrative expense coming down by a couple percentage points. And thatâs being redeployed and will continue to be redeployed on a quarter sequential basis in R&D and in selling. And the selling and marketing is paying back right away for us; the R&D will continue to pay back as we stay at the top of the food chain on the technology side. So we want to keep that model going.
Ajay [Kajirival] â FBR
Got it. So it seems like R&D and SG&A could go up from here but there are lots of other tailwinds that could help margins.
Ed Breen
Yeah. And look, the way I would look at it is the growth rate in the products businesses and in security are picking up very, very nice; and we model out obviously our vitality index â I guess you would know it as new products introduced, how much of revenue is that; and our percentages are picking up very nicely in both security and fire on the products side. And I think if you compare us to anybody else thatâs putting data points out there, our growth rate right now in the products business has been pretty nice and a big part of that is these new product introductions.
Ajay [Kajirival] â FBR
Good. Maybe just one question on deal valuations in the security spaces youâve seen over the last couple months â some very, very high multiples of revenues as a result of those valuations. So Iâd be curious to hear what youâre seeing in terms of valuations in the space, in terms of your pipeline. Has that influenced how say private equity or other strategics are thinking about the securities space?
Ed Breen
Well certainly itâs influenced us because weâre not going to do any acquisition that doesnât make good financial sense of very quick accretion for us. So I think what youâre alluding to, I know there were two decent-sized companies in the last month that got announced they were being acquired â one by private equity, one strategic â and they both had 14x multiples on them which you know, is up there. You can form your own opinion but I think our fire and security commercial business is a world-leading business, so I kind of like seeing those multiples out there but we would obviously be very cautious of buying something with those types of multiples on it. Youâll notice we were not in the bidding on those couple projects.
Ajay [Kajirival] â FBR
I like seeing those multiples too. Thank you very much.
Antonella Franzen
Operator, we have time for one more quick question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.
Gautam Khanna â Cowen & Co.
Yeah, just let me have a couple if you donât mind. As you mentioned you see some larger projects in flow that could hit in the next three months. Could you also talk about the pipeline beyond that if youâre looking at the six to twelve, do you see some other big ones out there on the back of the near-term ones?
Ed Breen
We do. You know, Gautam, the only thing I see slowing this thing down is if the world had another credit crunch because itâs availability of money to obviously do a big, new project. Again, none of thatâs in our backlog at this point in time, but when I look at these new projects itâs a lot of greenfield â people are going to build a new refinery for instance. And so as long as the world is kind of clicking along here it just looks like a multi-year good feeling in this space again unless a credit crunch hits.
Gautam Khanna â Cowen & Co.
To that point, you mentioned sort of the July orders stuff are still facing well, but are you seeing any sort of change in the customer behavior with respect to some of the shorter lead-time orders? Are they slowing down given all the noise in the world right now?
Ed Breen
Gautam, believe me â weâre looking at this every day. Our orders feel good. As you can see weâre about 7%. Again, I donât want to read too much into three weeks of July but the fact weâre running around 7%, it feels good and I donât see any different pattern by geography either as we look across our businesses. And the only place we have seen a little bit of softness, but we tend to see this a lot from time to time, is in retail. I think weâre seeing some softness on orders in North America and in [EMAYA] but not in the rest of the world. So in aggregate itâs not bad in retail but I do think we saw some softening there that I would maybe relate to the retailers being a little soft this last quarter or so. So I think that would be an accurate statement. But besides that weâre not seeing anything else.
Gautam Khanna â Cowen & Co.
Okay. And just a last one to clarify given the water dynamics at flow and the earlier comments on the incrementals at flow, when now do you expect to see the 14% reported margins at that business? Are we going to see it in fiscal â12 and if so is it Q3 or Q4?
Ed Breen
Yeah, let me just say this because weâre not giving guidance. You will see it next year in the fiscal year but Iâll talk in more detail about that when we talk next time.
Gautam Khanna â Cowen & Co.
Thanks, guys.
Antonella Franzen
Operator, that concludes our call.
