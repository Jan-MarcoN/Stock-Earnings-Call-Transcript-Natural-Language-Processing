With that, I will turn the call over to Sanjay.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Jay and good afternoon everyone. I will open my comments by saying that our financial performance over the past two quarters has been unacceptable to us as a management team. On todayâs call, we will discuss the underlying causes of our recent underperformance and the measures we are implementing that we believe will put SanDisk on a path to regain the excellence in execution that you have come to expect from us over the years. I will also summarize what has changed since we reported Q4 2014 results in January. Judy will then describe our first quarter results and guidance in more detail, and then Iâll conclude with a summary of our path forward.
Our Q1 results and 2015 outlook have been adversely impacted by the unusual confluence of four main factors: first, product issues, including qualification delays impacting embedded and enterprise sales; second, our reduced 2015 opportunity in the enterprise market due to rapid market shifts; third, weaker than anticipated pricing; and fourth, supply challenges.
Now, let me share more detail on each of these factors. First, starting with product issues, we have been working with a customer to qualify an embedded component for client SSD application. Qualification work for this new embedded component was going well early in the first quarter. However, during Q1, we encountered an issue related to a material used in our product assembly at the very last stage of our customerâs qualification process. We have a solution to this issue, but it requires our internal validation and customer re-qualification before production shipments can begin. The delay in sales of this embedded component was the single largest contributor to our Q1 revenue shortfall and will also impact our second quarter and 2015 results.
Continuing with product issues, we now expect that some of the 6-gig SAS and 12-gig SAS opportunities that we had included in our 2015 revenue outlook are reduced, primarily due to certain demand changes and delays in customer qualifications. As a result, we are reducing our estimates of 2015 sales of our SAS products. In spite of these challenges, we continue to believe that we will maintain a strong number two market share position within the SAS market. In addition, we are advancing our 12-gig SAS product roadmap with 15 nanometer NAND and a new higher performance controller and we expect to sample this product towards the end of this year.
The second factor impacting our performance is reduced opportunity for us in the enterprise market due to market shifts in PCIe and SATA. First, let me address the PCIe market. Our Q1 results as well as 2015 revenue estimates for our Fusion-io PCIe solutions are significantly below our original plan. The biggest contributor to our reduced 2015 enterprise PCIe outlook is that we are seeing a substantial portion of the PCIe TAM moving to lower cost solutions using enterprise SATA SSDs. This market shift has caused the near-term TAM to move from PCIes, where we are the market leader to enterprise SATA solutions, where our share is low given our relatively recent entry. We believe the broadening deployment of NVMe infrastructure and availability of NVMe PCIe solutions, along with lower cost PCIe solutions built on captive NAND, will contribute to the PCIe market expanding again, likely beginning in 2016. We plan to launch our new Fusion-io based PCIe solutions with our captive 1Y technology-based NAND later this month and expect revenue contribution from the new PCIe solutions later in the year after customer qualifications are completed.
In enterprise SATA SSDs, we have recently seen a demand shift to the 2 terabyte capacity point in the hyper-scale portion of the market, starting as early as the second quarter. We expect our 2 terabyte enterprise SATA product to be ready for production later this year. The current lack of this offering will also impact our enterprise SATA sales this year. The longer term impact of the hyper-scale market moving to these high capacity SATA SSDs is that it will expand the TAM. In enterprise SATA, we are working to improve our market position and broaden our portfolio with multiple new 15 nanometer product offerings launching later in the year.
Given the overall impact of these market shifts and certain SAS product issues that I described earlier, we no longer expect to reach our target of $1 billion of sales in enterprise this year. However, we still expect year-over-year enterprise revenue growth in 2015. The third factor having an impact on our Q1 results and 2015 outlook is pricing. We experienced softer than expected pricing conditions in some parts of our business in Q1, including in global retail sales and in client SSDs. We also made the choice to pull back on sales of private label products late in the quarter because of the accelerated price decline in this channel. We now believe there is some industry oversupply in the first half of 2015.
Moving to the fourth factor, supply challenges, in the first quarter, due to our supply constraints, we were unable to meet the timing of delivery required to fulfill all of the demand for a large hyper-scale customer in enterprise SATA. This mismatch in supply availability resulted in a reduced share award for us with this customer. Separately, our overall petabyte supply for the year has been somewhat reduced as we are now planning for a higher mix of 1Y technology relative to 15 nanometer in the second half 2015 to support the mix of our business requirements.
In response to these challenging business conditions and in order to position ourselves to successfully achieve our long-term growth objectives and to better align ourselves with the markets and customers we are serving, I will highlight a few of the changes we are making within the company. From an organization perspective, we are combining all of our enterprise solutions teams, including our InfiniFlash system solutions and software, under a unified enterprise group led by Sumit Sadana, our Chief Strategy Officer. This will enable greater synergies between the teams, accelerate decision-making and improve execution in enterprise. John Scaramuzzo, Senior Vice President, Enterprise Storage Solutions and Ravi Swaminathan, Vice President, Systems and Software Solutions, will report to Sumit. Further, we are combining our mobile solutions and client SSD groups into one group focused on client platforms led by Drew Henry, who has been leading our mobile solutions group.
In addition, we have created a Chief Technology Officer position that will be assumed by Kevin Conley. Kevin, who has been leading our client SSD solutions group, has many years of strong engineering experience and has a keen understanding of customer ecosystem and market trends. Having Kevin in this new position, with his background and customer relationships, will improve our ability to both predict technology trends and tailor our roadmap and investments to meet customer needs. We believe all of these organizational changes will simplify and improve our product roadmap execution as well as enhance our focus on the customer.
Within our global engineering organizations, we are strengthening our product development, validation and qualification processes. For example, we are deepening our engagements with our customers to validate our solutions on their next generation platforms earlier in the development cycle and before entering final qualification. In enterprise, we have had to support multiple hardware and firmware platforms as we integrated several companies that were acquired over a fairly short timeframe. We are now reducing the number of platforms and product architectures as we converge the roadmaps. This will increase leverage of engineering resources and improve our product execution. We have discussed these changes with our customers and they are not only enthusiastic about these improvements we are making, but it is clear that they are vested in our success.
Further, in light of the near-term revenue outlook, we are lowering our expenses with a reduction in force during Q2 of approximately 5% of our non-factory headcount and are implementing other measures to reduce our expenses from our original 2015 plans.
Before I ask Judy to provide her financial discussion, I will note that our teamâs top priority in 2015 is to focus, execute and reinvigorate SanDisk and this will require the combined energy and time of the entire SanDisk team. I want to be clear that the reason we decided to postpone our Investor Day is because I want my team to be wholly focused on execution. Having said that, we expect to be fully engaged with you through various conferences, meetings and other forums throughout the year.
I will now turn the call to Judy for the financial discussion and I will then come back for further remarks.
Judy Bruner
Thank you, Sanjay. As Sanjay described, the entire management team is committed to substantially improving our financial performance. I will review our Q1 results and then discuss our outlook.
Our first quarter revenue of $1.33 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 12% year-over-year. Our Q1 revenue came 35% from retail and 65% from commercial channels. Our retail revenue was down 15% sequentially and down 13% year-over-year. While there were lingering effects of our Q4 supply challenges on our retail sales, we were able to supply and sell a higher than forecasted number of units, albeit at lower prices than we had expected. In total, our retail revenue met our expectations for the quarter. By product category, the year-over-year retail revenue decline is being driven primarily by the imaging card market. Our Q1 forecast miss came from our commercial sales, where our revenue was down 27% sequentially and down 11% year-over-year.
Within our commercial revenue, there were three key drivers of the sequential decline. The largest sequential decline within commercial revenue came from embedded products. While we expected a decline in this area due largely to seasonality and some supply limitations, we had expected some partial offset from a new embedded component for client SSD applications. As Sanjay described, we encountered qualification delays for this embedded component, which resulted in a larger than expected sequential decline in embedded revenue. The second key driver of sequential decline in commercial revenue was the phasing out of our client SSD program with a large customer. This decline was as expected for Q1. Enterprise SSD was the third key area contributing to the sequential commercial revenue decline and this was also a miss from our Q1 forecast. The key drivers of the sequential enterprise decline included a lost opportunity in enterprise SATA due to a supply timing mismatch with a hyper-scale customer and lower PCIe sales due largely to the rapidly shifting enterprise market, both as Sanjay described.
On a year-over-year basis, the Q1 decline in commercial revenue was driven by the client SSD program loss with one customer and by lower private label sales, partially offset by growth in enterprise embedded and also client SSD revenue from other OEM customers. Our sales to private label accounts were down year-over-year due to both supply constraints and our conscious pull back from this channel due to aggressive pricing late in Q1. The overall ASP per gigabyte declined 10% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. The price decline was more pronounced in retail and private label markets. While prices were soft in most retail geographies, one contributing factor in Europe was the impact of the weak euro on our U.S. dollar sales. Our gigabytes sold declined 15% sequentially and increased 24% year-over-year.
Turning to gross margin, our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was lower than our January estimate due primarily to lower enterprise sales mix, higher inventory-related charges and higher price decline. The inventory related charges were largest for non-captive memory used in our enterprise PCIe products and for SSD controllers, both due to demand reductions. Non-captive memory comprised 2% of our Q1 bit sales and the yen to dollar exchange rate in our captive memory cost of sales was 108 as expected. Our all-in cost per gigabyte declined 6% sequentially and 17% year-over-year.
Within our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses of $376 million, we took a $41 million charge in the restructuring and other line that includes legal settlements as well as Fusion-io related restructuring charges. Excluding the legal settlements, our non-GAAP expenses were below our January forecast primarily due to lower incentive compensation and lower than planned headcount. Our Q1 GAAP expenses include $61 million impairment charge for an in-process R&D project from the Fusion-io acquisition. The impairment charge was driven by our decision to cancel this project in order to reduce the number of platforms under development and to redirect resources towards our next-generation PCIe platform. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin, inclusive of the restructuring and litigation settlements was 15%.
Our GAAP taxes for Q1 include a discrete benefit of $21 million from a tax audit settlement. The non-GAAP tax rate of 32% includes the audit settlement and other one-time items spread in the full year rate. Our diluted share count came down on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis driven by strong share repurchases. In Q1, we spent $750 million to repurchase over 9.3 million shares.
Our share of flash venture fab investments during Q1 was $282 million, and non-fab capital investments were $98 million, primarily related to our Malaysia and China assembly and test facilities and our India development center. The combined fab and non-fab capital investments for Q1 of $380 million utilized cash of $109 million, with the difference funded by joint venture working capital and leases. With cash flow from operations of $309 million, our free cash flow for Q1 was $200 million. Our joint venture equipment lease guarantees were $606 million at the end of Q1.
Now, I will turn to our outlook. In Q2 we expect a sequential decline in revenue, influenced by three primary drivers. First, our Q2 client SSD revenue will be down sequentially due to the end of life in Q1 of the SSD program with a major customer, which we previously expected would end in Q2. Second, we expect enterprise revenue to decline sequentially in Q2 in SATA and SAS for the reasons Sanjay described. Finally, the lower price points we saw in the latter part of Q1 will also impact several parts of our business in Q2. We expect our total Q2 revenue to be in the range of $1.150 billion to $1.225 billion.
In the second half of the year, we expect sequential revenue growth in both Q3 and Q4, but we no longer expect year-over-year revenue growth in the second half. We believe that the primary drivers of sequential quarterly revenue growth in the second half will be our embedded products, continued gains with key client SSD customers and stronger seasonality. Within enterprise, we expect our business to stabilize in the second half of 2015 and regain growth momentum in 2016.
Our full year 2015 revenue forecast is now $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. This represents a substantial year-over-year revenue decline and a significant reduction from our previous 2015 outlook. The largest driver of our forecasted year-over-year revenue decline is the loss of the client SSD program with a large customer. The other key contributors are expected higher price decline than in 2014 coupled with limited supply due to rebuilding inventory levels as we have previously discussed.
When we provided our 2015 forecast in January, we had expected that our enterprise sales would generate significantly more growth in 2015 and provide a significant offset to the loss of the client SSD program. Since January, the biggest changes in our outlook for the year are reduced enterprise growth, higher price decline and a delay in the qualification of an embedded component for a client SSD application. From a petabyte perspective, our expected revenue bit growth is now well below 30%. We will purchase fewer non-captive petabytes than previously planned and we have adjusted our wafer nodal and die mix to align to our latest forecasts.
Turning to gross margin, we expect our Q2 gross margin to be adversely impacted by a sequential decline in enterprise revenue, an increased mix of multi-chip package products within embedded sales, a reduction in overall sales volume and the full quarter impact of lower market prices late in Q1. Partially offsetting these factors is a benefit in our wafer cost from a weaker yen, which we expect will be at a rate of approximately 117 in our Q2 cost of sales. We are forecasting our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 37% to 40%. In the second half of the year, we expect positive impact to gross margins from a higher mix of X3 memory, improving sales volume and likely some further positive impact from the yen, although we expect a partial offsetting impact to gross margin from an increased mix of embedded and client SSD products which tend to carry lower than corporate average gross margins.
We expect our non-GAAP gross margin for the second half to be in the range of 40% to 43%. We are taking actions to minimize our expenses while still making the important technology and product investments for the future. We expect Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $355 million and $365 million, inclusive of restructuring expenses related to our expense reduction measures.
We now expect total 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.4 billion, down from our previous forecast of $1.5 billion, and the $1.4 billion forecast is inclusive of restructuring and other expenses. For the remainder of 2015, we expect our non-GAAP other income and expense to be approximately breakeven and our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 32%. Our fab and non-fab capital investment forecast remains at $1.4 billion and we expect cash usage to be approximately $500 million, with the remainder funded by joint venture working capital and joint venture equipment leases.
We are disappointed that we will not achieve the operating margin in our target financial model in 2015, but we remain committed to our target model of 25% to 30% non-GAAP operating margin as the right profitability level for our company. The actions we have underway to improve our performance are targeted at restoring revenue growth and getting us back to our target financial model. We remain confident in the significant opportunity ahead of us and we have the breadth of products, expertise and capability to capitalize on it.
Now I will turn the call back to Sanjay for his further remarks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thanks Judy. To summarize, I want to assure you that we are acting quickly and decisively to address the issues that have caused our recent underperformance. We understand the fundamental reasons behind our challenges. We have confidence that the initiatives we are working on will significantly improve our execution and we are working to better anticipate and react more quickly to changes in the market and indeed, lead the market with breakthrough products.
SanDiskâs fundamentals remain strong with a solid growth strategy aimed at creating shareholder value. We remain a global leader in retail with a great brand and strong consumer preference for our products. We believe the supply challenges that affected our retail products late in 2014 and early in Q1 are behind us, with execution in retail back to normal. Our iNAND portfolio for the embedded market is solid, with very good progress achieved in qualifying our new 1Y X3 technology based products, including our iNand 7132 high performance platform that was launched in the first quarter. We expect volume shipments of our 7132 to begin in the second half of 2015.
Our 15 nanometer X3 embedded product qualifications are underway and we expect to ramp volume shipments in the second quarter. In client SSDs, we are shipping X3 based solutions to both the channel and OEM markets, signaling strong shift of these markets to X3, where we have proven advantages. We have also released a 15 nanometer client SSD to retail and expect to begin OEM qualifications in the third quarter. We are seeing a continued increase in the attach rates of SSDs to laptops, which is a trend that bodes well for the broadening adoption of client SSDs beyond 2015. Our efforts to diversify our client SSD revenue are proceeding well, including greater traction with Tier 1 OEMs and in the channel. As we had mentioned in our January call, we expect to return to year-over-year growth in our client SSD revenue in 2016.
In enterprise, we are strengthening our product roadmap and execution and expect to regain our momentum and continue to drive enterprise revenue growth in 2016 and beyond. Despite the near-term issues in enterprise which we are addressing, SanDisk remains one of the largest enterprise storage solutions providers in the highest growth portion of the flash industry. We believe that our unique ability to design solutions from the memory cell design to software that accelerates application performance has been a key enabler for us to bring innovative solutions such as our 4-terabyte SAS SSD and the InfiniFlash platform to market.
InfiniFlash, an industry first, is the massively scalable, highest density storage solution, underscoring SanDiskâs strong capabilities to innovate and differentiate our offerings with high-value solutions in the enterprise market. We believe that when it comes to the breadth of solutions and depth of our expertise and capabilities in the enterprise market, we are a clear leader in high-value enterprise solutions and expect to continue to improve our position in this important market over time.
From a fab manufacturing perspective, the output challenges that we discussed on our Q4 call are behind us. Regarding 15 nanometer technology, production ramp continues to go well with excellent yields. We remain on track for our 15 nanometer technology to achieve greater than 50% of our second half bit sales. We have also begun gearing up for the pilot production of 48-layer 3D NAND technology, which is an industry first. This breakthrough memory architecture utilizes numerous process and device innovations and demonstrates our strength in introducing industry leading memory technologies. Our 48-layer 3D NAND technology provides an exciting combination of increased density, higher performance and lower power, which will be used in a broad range of solutions from removable products to enterprise SSDs. Our 3D NAND pilot production will commence in the second half of the year and will be introduced for commercial use in 2016.
Given our expectations to return to stronger performance in 2016 and our confidence in our long-term prospects, we remain committed to our capital return program. In Q1, we returned $750 million through share repurchases, a 50% increase over Q4. We expect to return another $750 million through share repurchase before the end of the fiscal year. This would result in total 2015 share repurchase of $1.5 billion, and combined with our dividend, total 2015 capital return of approximately $1.75 billion. This is more than we returned in 2014 and is significantly higher than our expected 2015 free cash flow.
I have described in somewhat excruciating detail the rare convergence of several issues that are impacting our business in 2015. I have every confidence that we will emerge stronger from this setback, as we improve our execution and continue to evolve the company to remain at the forefront of the flash industry. I am energized by the capabilities and deep expertise we have created to continue to bring industry leading innovative solutions to customers. I look forward to sharing our progress with you over the next several months as we work towards our goals and return to sequential growth in the second half of 2015.
With that, we will open the line for questions.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Sanjay. Thank you, Judy. Can I have the questions please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney
Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is on the longer term gross margin target, Judy, I know you reiterated target operating margin. I am wondering on the target gross margins, given that you havenât had the right mix of products, especially in SSDs and need to introduce new products, do you think you are going to need to price more aggressively? And if so what sort of gross margin implications can we expect from that?
Judy Bruner
Sure, Mark. Like operating margin, we donât expect to achieve our target gross margin model this year in 2015, but we remain committed to the target models both at the operating margin line and the gross margin line and we believe that those remain the right ranges for our business and we are confident we can get back to those ranges. And that gross margin range is 45% to 51%.
Mark Delaney
Okay, thatâs helpful. And then for a follow-up question for Sanjay, do you think the NAND industry would benefit from consolidation? And then if you think that, how would you expect SanDisk to participate in that potential consolidation?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, I am not going to speculate on the consolidation aspect. However, I will point out to you that NAND industry has tremendous growth opportunities. NAND industry last year was about $32 billion and growing towards $40 billion by â over $40 billion by 2018 timeframe. And we at SanDisk are extremely focused on really capturing the high value solutions portion of this market growth, particularly through enterprise solutions that we have discussed today as well as through our system level solutions such as InfiniFlash, which will really create new innovative market opportunities for big data applications and scale-out datacenter infrastructure. So, lot of exciting opportunities. I think the key is going to be to really have strong technology foundation, leadership in technology as we have in our 2D technology and with the 3D roadmap and strong portfolio of solutions through vertical integration that really enables us to capture the opportunities ahead. Of course in 2015 as we have discussed, we have faltered some in our execution as well as we have been focused on growing and integrating our markets, integrating our various acquisitions and there have been some market shifts as well, but we remain very committed to continue to drive the growth opportunities ahead for our business.
Mark Delaney
Thank you.
Operator
And we will take our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you so much. Actually, I had two questions. Judy, can you update us on your cost and your bit shipment targets for the year? I think before you were saying your captive bit target was 35% to 40%, but that you could revenue kind of 30% maximum. Now, it sounds like captive bit supplies maybe 30% growth. Does that mean you can revenue like maybe low 20s? And then I also want it on the cost side to see whether you are still happy with your goal of down 15% to 25% this year?
Judy Bruner
Sure. On the supply side in terms of bit growth, I recall that last quarter in January we said we expect it to be at the higher end of a 35% to 40% supply bit growth. Now, our bit growth expectations in supply have come down somewhat due to primarily mixing more towards 1Y relative to 1Z to meet our demand profile, but we still expect our supply bit growth in that 35% to 40% range. In terms of our revenue bit growth, we have said in January that we expected to be no more than 30% revenue bit growth because of the need to rebuild our inventory levels. At this point, you are right that our revenue bit growth has come down fairly substantially and it is well below 30% now in terms of our revenue bit growth. In terms of our cost improvement, we do still expect to achieve cost improvement for the year in the 15% to 25% range. And as you saw in the first quarter, it was year-over-year an improvement of 17%.
Timothy Arcuri
Thank you so much, Judy.
Operator
Thank you. We will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer
Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess, Sanjay, my first question, just a little bit of clarification from your perspective. You talked about in your prepared comments within the enterprise market kind of a mix shift away from PCIe towards SATA. I am kind of curious from your perspective why is that happening? Is that purely cost? And why do you think itâs transitory instead of just kind of limiting sort of the TAM structurally as you think about the enterprise market?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, as I mentioned, in the near-term in 2015, we are seeing that PCIe opportunity is really shifting towards clients, I mean toward enterprise SATA solutions. And this is because as you know PCIe solutions have commanded higher pricing in the market and have addressed a certain portion of the workload requirements. On the other hand, enterprise SATA solutions are able to address the market to meet its performance requirements in an adequate fashion while using multiple SATA drive in a rate configuration and basically being good enough in terms of meeting the application requirement and doing so in a more cost effective fashion versus the PCIe solutions that are there in the marketplace today. However, we see that in the future this market TAM will return to growth that will be enabled by first of all solutions such as what we will bring out with our captive NAND. In fact, as I mentioned, we will be announcing those later this month. The captive NAND will help us bring down the cost. It will enable us to offer PCIe solutions at lower price points and still strong margins â heavy margins and this will then enable us to grow the PCIe TAM as we go forward.
At the same time, the NVMe and PCIe solutions will help expand the market opportunity, because that too will go towards addressing a broader set of industry infrastructure applications. So, itâs really the combination of benefit of captive memory on PCIe solutions, lowering the price points and expecting the TAM getting PCIe into new workload environments and really capturing the benefit of the low latency, high ops capability at attractive cost structures, and then also the NVMe deployment as it becomes a common place in the industry over the next few years. So, this is what will start driving the growth of PCIe and SanDisk is addressing both of these aspects with our captive memory and PCIe solutions are starting to come out this year as I mentioned and NVMe solutions starting to come out in 2016 timeframe.
John Pitzer
Thatâs helpful, Sanjay. And then I guess as my follow-up, the last couple of years the backdrop for the NAND industry has been a pretty benign supply environment as node transitions on planar have been less efficient, I guess we are now getting close enough to the 3D transition that we as investors need to start to make some assessments of every playerâs relative cost structure and what could happen to big growth, I am kind of hoping you can help us understand how you think your cost structure is going to line up with the rest of the 3D players, how you see big growth kind of accelerating as you move through 3D and as you enter the question if you can talk a little bit about how you believe your royalty stream will fare in the 3D transition that will be helpful?
Sanjay Mehrotra
First of all, with respect to our 3D technology our 48 layer technology is an industry first. We have always said that we plan to bring our 3D technology once it becomes competitive with 2D NAND technology in production. And our 15 nanometer 2D NAND technology as you know is the lowest cost technology in the industry and I believe that in 2015 timeframe our 48 layer 3D NAND technology will be the lowest cost technology bar none any 2D or 3D technologies that would be in the marketplace at that time.
With respect to the bit growth that will be contributed by 3D technology certainly on a per wafer basis 3D NAND does give you higher bit growth on a per wafer basis. But as we have discussed before 3D technologies require significant capital investments. There will be a production ramp occurring over our 3D technology as it gets applied across various products that are there in the NAND industry as it gets qualified by the customers as well as the production ramp of 3D is managed in the industry by various suppliers add their own â taking into account their own considerations have different bases. All of this we believe will continue to lead towards an industry supply growth which will be similar to the industry bit supply growth in 2015 timeframe. We have said before that we expect the industry supply bit growth to be in the 35% to 40% perhaps closer to 40% for 2015. And I would expect that industry supply growth even with 3D RAM in the future years to be approximately the same as 40% or so. And â okay, your third part of your question was regarding 3D IP position, and I would like to point out here that we have a strong 3D patent portfolio and this will be extremely relevant to our future licenses as well. And today of course we get as we have mentioned before from our major licensees we get royalties on their 2D or 3D NAND production. I hope I have addressed all your questions.
John Pitzer
Yes. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, John. Next question please.
Operator
Next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore ISI.
CJ Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question Judy I was hoping to I guess go back to your commentary regarding long-term gross margin targets. And I guess that the question here is if you think about retail slowing on the margin, client SSD becoming more competitive on the enterprise side eight guys playing there and clearly understanding your competitive positioning there. But are we entering a world where gross margins in NAND overall are not in the sort of 40% territory, but sub that and we would love to hear why you think 45%, 51% is sustainable?
Judy Bruner
No, we donât think we are entering a territory where our gross margins should be sub-40%, in fact I would point out that in a year that is quite challenged for with all of these individual factors converging we still expect our gross margin in the second half of this year to be in the 40% to 43% range. And as we are able to begin growing our enterprise revenue at a more substantial rate going forward we think that will definitely contribute to returning our gross margins to the target model of 45% to 51%. So, we remain confident that we can get back there and we believe thatâs the right model for our business.
CJ Muse
Okay. And then if I could follow-up with two questions. The first one, in terms of the organizational changes that you are making, are the cost associated with that fully embedded in the cost structure that you outlined for the full year? And then the second question in terms of moving bits captive, I guess would love a little more clarity there in terms of Fusion-io and the timing when you expect all of that will be in-house and I guess what that will do for price points and maybe clarify on what kind of growth you could see in expansion of the TAM as you alluded to in the prior question? Thank you.
Judy Bruner
Okay. In terms of the cost of organization changes and the cost related to restructuring actions, yes, those costs are all included in the $1.4 billion that I provided for the year and the range that I gave for the second quarter. So, we say that both the full year number of $1.4 billion includes the restructuring and other charges in Q1 and also includes additional restructuring charges that we expect to take in order to implement our cost reduction measures. In terms of moving our Fusion-io related products or PCIe related products to captive, as Sanjay said, we expect to introduce or announce this quarter a product based upon our captive memory and that will of course ramp over time and we will move more and more across the year towards captive memory in our PCIe product. Does that answer your question?
CJ Muse
Yes, thank you.
Judy Bruner
Okay.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, CJ. Next question please.

Weâll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes, thanks for taking my question. Sanjay, I just have one clarification question. I was on the impression that with Grantley platform ramping and associated several upgrades to NVMe and even PCIe buffer structure would be in solid demand. Is there something that has happened over the past couple of months that has made a more material change? And to that end, I thought that prior acquisition that was closed almost 6 months ago was going to help you benefit from the Grantley introduction from late last year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, with respect to NVMe, the deployment of NVMe in the datacenter and IT infrastructures is really going to be more from 2016 onward timeframe and the infrastructure then ultimately needs to the growth of NVMe PCIe solutions as well as these solutions provide the optimum benefit in terms of cost and performance. So, in 2015, it really is not much of a total industry TAM opportunity in terms of NVMe. And as I mentioned, we will have NVMe solutions in 2016 timeframe. And this year as I mentioned, our shift from PCIe TAM in the industry towards enterprise SATA is really happening due to the overall attractiveness of enterprise SATA solutions in terms of lower cost structure and their ability to provide good enough performance for the application. And let me just point out that SanDisk despite these â the PCIe market TAM somewhat stalling this year in PCIe we expect to fully remain as the number one market share leader and we plan to continue to address that in a similar fashion in 2016 timeframe with solutions that are using our captive memory as well as when we introduce NVMe solutions sometime in 2016.
Mehdi Hosseini
And as a follow-up, the current environment kind of reminds me of 2012 when it seemed like back then you didnât have the right embedded product and you have one of the best in NAND architecture, but you werenât able to have the right NAND for the right product? Is that â what gives you confidence that you are going to be able to come in and better manage and qualify the product? It seems to me that there is underlying issue here that keeps recurring every few years, is there anything on the operations side that you can do to better manage getting the right NAND into the right product?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So as we mentioned certainly we have had some issues related to execution and in terms of certain product qualifications and our ability to meet in a timely fashion some of the market requirements and we definitely are not satisfied, not happy with the execution. And we can and we will do better and these are the things that we are addressing here. In terms of some of the organizational changes that we discussed as well as mentioning that how we are focusing on improving the processes and the planning related to our engineering execution, roadmap execution and working closely with the customers to understand their requirements and some times working closely with them to address the qualification early in the development cycle. So these are all the actions that we are taking that help us enhance our customer focus, make us more nimble in responding to the market changes and customer requirements and will enhance our execution going forward.
I would like to mention here that SanDisk has had strong track record of execution and when you look at today in detail our leadership and execution continues to be solid in embedded and client SSDs we are continuing to grow our opportunities with X3 technology. Client SSD a matter of we worked about 4 years from 2011 timeframe onwards we grew our business to over $1 billion. And in enterprise as we have acquired different companies over the course of last 4 years, we have grown our business from nothing, no presence in enterprise to over $600 billion of business in 2014 and looking at year-over-year growth in 2015 and 2016 as well.
One of the challenges as we put together these various acquisitions has been that each one of them brought with it its own product architecture, its own controllers and firmware and solution architecture. And now as we have used that successfully to make as the company to build our company into a powerful enterprise company, now as we look at scaling this infrastructure further for enterprise business opportunity, we are streamlining our platforms and optimizing the combinations of controllers and firmware architectures to really give us a streamline roadmap that is efficient and more scalable. And this is what we are focused on. I am confident that the actions we had taken, we will be able to address these challenges. We recognized that speed bump we have faced here but with the team that we have here with all the capabilities that we have here at SanDisk with our vertical integration and strong track record of execution, I am confident that we will recover from this ever stronger and continue to march towards our goal of becoming an enterprise leader in the industry.
Mehdi Hosseini

We will take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah
Yes. Thank you. I noticed that the removable business increased as a percentage of sales this quarter, but I am curious with the market trends you are seeing particularly in the high end segment of the mobile phone market, how do you guys think about the removable card business as a percentage of your mix?
Judy Bruner
We think that over time there is somewhat of downward pressure on the removable card business coming primarily from the imaging market and the retail. And that over time that does become somewhat smaller percentage of the business. We have said that for a while that over time we see the enterprise percentage of our business increasing and the retail percentage of our business declining somewhat although we do continue to see growth in certain parts of our retail business.
Sanjay Mehrotra
And within the mobile markets certainly vast majority of the smartphones that are out there continued to have card slots and that creates mobile card opportunity for us in the retail market and some parts of the OEM business as well. And of course embedded mobile is the large part of SanDisk business as well and this is where we continued to have strong portfolio of solutions with our iNAND eMMC products as well as other embedded solutions in terms of customized solutions and multi-chip packages.
Romit Shah
I guess where I am going with this is that if the removable business over time is going to be declining as a percentage, then sort of implicit in your outlook for gross margins of 45% to 51% consistent with the prior target. It sort of implies that the other businesses are going to generate better margins than they did in the past. And I am just struggling to understand how that might be so?
Judy Bruner
We have said in the past that both the retail removable business and the enterprise part of our business have gross margins higher than the corporate average. And so over time, we see the removable â part of the removable business, primarily the imaging part of it coming down somewhat as a percentage and the enterprise part of our business going up as a percentage. And we see an offset there and the impact on our gross margin allowing us to continue to remain in our target model of 45% to 51%.
Romit Shah
Okay. And if I could just one last question, did you guys change your CapEx guidance for the year?
Judy Bruner
We did not change the total gross CapEx that remains at approximately $1.4 billion. I did say that it would use about $500 million of cash and that was a little bit higher cash than I had previously estimated in January. And that is primarily due to the timing of certain tools being installed in the fab and primarily related to some pull-in of the timing of installation of the BiCS pilot line tools meaning that they will get paid for â more of them will get paid for in 2015 â instead of 2016.
Romit Shah
Thanks, Judy. I appreciate it.

Next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Thanks for taking my question. On the enterprise SAS side, where you guys have a strong number two position in the market, what happened here as it relates to the demand changes that you talked about that are impacting your 6-gig and 12-gig SAS drives? Is it a demand issue with your hyperscale cloud or enterprise customers or is it a product substitution issue similar to what you are seeing with your PCIe business? Any color here would be helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
As I mentioned in my remarks that compared to our January outlook on the SAS side for 6-gig and 12-gig, we have experienced as we have engaged with customers and continuing to broaden the opportunities, we have experienced certain qualifications, delays, as well as â as we have worked with the customers on the qualification timelines for the year, we have seen that some of our timelines that we estimated earlier maybe somewhat pushed out thereby reducing some of the SAS opportunities for us in the year. And also we have seen some demand changes to us in SAS from our customers and those could be the latest to some of the customer-specific considerations regarding timing of their purchases as well as with respect to some of the share shifts happening in the enterprise SAS market. Overall, the enterprise SAS market continues to grow nicely and is expected to have strong growth in the future years as well. And we are of course focused on strengthening our SAS roadmap with 15-nanometer technology and leveraging higher performance controllers. And we plan to get these ready for sampling late in the year and will become a 2016 opportunity, but as I mentioned with all of these moving pieces, within SAS, we will continue to be a number two share position in the industry in 2015 I believe.
Harlan Sur
Thanks for that, Sanjay. And then on the qual issue on your client SSD, I know last quarter you were talking about your 1Y X3 SSD in qualification with several OEMs. Is this the particular product that is having issues? And how confident is the team in terms of the corrective action? And if all goes well, i.e., you pass the qual, when do you start shipping this platform to your major customers?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, let me be clear that with respect to the client SSD that we have with 1Y and X3 technology, as I mentioned we have begun shipments of that two OEMs and we are â of course we have been shipping that in retail channels for a while and we are engaged with other OEMs in qualifications as well. So, our execution on client SSD with 1Y as well as our 15 nanometer technology node is going for our plans. The qualification delay that I talked about it was related to a new component, a new embedded component that goes into SSD applications. This is different from the client SSDs that I just mentioned where 1Y and 15 nanometer qualifications and production plans are just going fine. Now related to this new embedded component for SSD applications with a particular customer here, I mentioned the challenge that we experienced here was at a very late stage of a qualification by the customer and the evolution to this has changed of a packaging material in the assembly of this particular component. So we are engaged in qualification process with the customers. And we expect that to take another 2 months to 3 months before that process can be completed. And of course until the qualification is completed, we cannot begin production shipments with the customer.
Harlan Sur
Okay. Thank you.

We will take our next question from Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.
Doug Freedman
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I could focus in a little bit on the balance sheet I was a little surprised that the inventory number did not rise faster, it was my understanding I believe that you are hoping to build some inventory and maybe if you can give us the sense of what inventory should do throughout the balance of the year that would be helpful in understanding just how much output you are going to have form your factory versus how much you are going to be able to sell?
Judy Bruner
In terms of our inventory levels, the inventory levels actually have increased more than as apparent on the balance sheet because keep in mind that what really matters is the number of petabytes that we have available in our inventory and because of the cost of those petabytes is coming down all the time you donât really see the full impact of that in the dollar value of inventory on the balance sheet. And also keep in mind that I mentioned that we took some additional inventory reserves this quarter for certain pockets of inventory. So we are making good progress on restoring the inventory levels on our balance sheet. And we have some pockets of constraints still, but we believe that in the second quarter that essentially we will be where we want to be in terms of our inventory level.
Doug Freedman
Great. Will it be possible to get color on what type of inventory charges you are expecting in Q2 and if those inventory charges, is there a potential that we get that inventory back into this system as the market or qualifications occur?
Judy Bruner
Well, the inventory charges that I discussed are really inventory charges in Q1 and those related to some SSD controllers and also related to non-captive memory that we had purchased for the PCIe products. But we always have some level of inventory charges. I am not going to predict what those inventory charges might be in the future.
Doug Freedman
Okay. If I could move on and look it as my follow-up the embedded iNAND opportunity, I believe in the past you had talked about a rather sizable ramp in the back half of 2015, can you bring us up to speed on if you are still expecting iNAND opportunity in handsets to contribute to revenue growth in the back half and how those qualifications are going?
Sanjay Mehrotra
In the back half of the year, we will have embedded growth coming from iNAND solutions thatâs I talked about in my prepared the 7132 X3 based 1Y X3 technology based solutions. Also our 15 nanometer embedded solutions will start ramping up. Of course it will be our portfolio of embedded solutions including customized solutions as well as our iNAND solutions that will be ramping in the second half giving us growth opportunity for our revenue in the second half of the year.
Doug Freedman
Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore
Great. Thank you. I noticed that in the metrics that you gave you didnât breakout royalties, thatâs now within other. Is there any change within royalty? And shouldnât royalty as a percentage of revenue gone up given what happened to the rest of revenue?
Judy Bruner
There was no significant change in royalty revenue. In fact, itâs primarily wafers and components that went down as a percentage given some of the supply constraints that were impacting us lingering in the first quarter. So, there is no significant change there in the first quarter. We decided as you saw on that metrics page to begin breaking out the client SSD solutions from the enterprise solutions. And at the same time, we took the two smallest categories, the other products and the license and royalty and combined them.
Joe Moore
Okay, great. And then I wonder if you could talk â you talked a lot about products and the various struggles that you guys are dealing with, but you have also talked about some oversupply in the first half. And I guess can you just talk about that? When you talk about raw NAND supply and demand, I feel like a lot of your competitors were more cautious than you guys were a year ago and I feel like they are more optimistic than you are now. And I guess am I misunderstanding that? And how do you see â understanding all of the product issues that you have talked about, how do you see supply demand both through the second quarter and then in the back half of the year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
I believe in the first quarter, there was some excess in the industry in terms of supply and that excess is working through itself in the second quarter and we do expect that in the second half of the year, the industry would be in balance with respect to demand and supply, but finally excess really in first quarter is just working its way through in the second quarter.
Joe Moore
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
Next question is from Mark Newman with Bernstein.
Mark Newman
Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question actually is more specifically around enterprise SSDs again. I would like to get a bit of understanding of why these markets have shifted as you said, for example, moved towards more SATA, and why you think you guys were caught off guard like this? I mean, was this just one very big specific customer that just changed their decision or is this a wider change thatâs happening, moving towards SATA and any other kind of changes you alluded to in enterprise SSD markets? And related to that, you commented about reduction in force about 5% and what I am worried about is does this mean that you are going to have potentially â or could this mean you might have potentially a narrower set of expertise and products going forwards, which might leave you more at risk of suffering from these market shifts in the future, because I would have thought that possibly one of the reasons you are suffering from this is perhaps you are not equally positioned in all products. And so if the market shifts in the way that you are not prepared for then you suffer, but if you have a more broad set of products, then perhaps you would suffer less. So, I am just wondering if you could comment on that, but particularly the first part which is why you are seeing â why were you caught off guard in these structural changes?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, let me address that from the point of view of PCIe shifting towards enterprise SATA in the near-term. And then I will also comment on some of the market shifts that we have seen in the enterprise SATA market itself. So, as I mentioned on the PCIe side due to the high price points on PCIe that have existed, there have been opportunities to instead utilize lower price point SATA solutions with acceptable performance to ultimately meet the infrastructure for datacenters more cost effective. We began to see some of this trend late last year, but certainly we should have just did better in terms of understanding that this was a trend that was building into a wider trend in the marketplace. And we understood that during the course of the first quarter certainly. And whatâs happening there is that itâs not just limited to one or two large customers, it is happening primarily across broader range of customer applications for PCIe. I do believe that at our market assessment shows that this trend will reverse itself with respect to PCIe solutions becoming more cost effective and the TAM resuming growth going forward from 2016 onwards.
I would also like to comment on enterprise SATA. I mentioned there that we have seen rapid shift in hyper-scale market in particular towards 2 terabyte capacity points because that gives overall highest capacity points. With availability of that capacity point in the industry enables a more cost effective infrastructure in the datacenter. We had expected even last year that the market would be needing 2 terabyte capacity points in 2015 timeframe and we have been working closely with hyper-scale customers in this regard. I would like to point out that enterprise SATA as a market that we actually just began to engage with about 4 quarters ago and a first quarter of meaningful revenue shipments with enterprise SATA in hyper-scale market was fourth quarter of last year.
So as we begin our engagement last year with our customers we have saw the need for 2 terabytes, but what happened here is that during the first quarter the customers themselves gave â decided to switch with availability of 2 terabytes capacity points becoming available in the markets from 1 terabytes capacity points to 2 terabytes capacity points, again because of the cost benefits. Of course we had been engaged with the customers with our portfolio of solutions up to a terabyte of capacity points. We need now 2 terabytes capacity points which I mentioned we will have later in the year and of course we will also be having our 15 nanometer based enterprise SATA solutions available to address this market late in the year as well.
So there are two different market shifts going on and as I mentioned PCIe is where we have had high shares, the market shifting towards enterprise SATA where we have had low shares. And within enterprise SATA or in hyper-scale opportunities increasing demand for 2 terabytes capacity points. As we enhance our roadmap on enterprise SATA we will have growing opportunity in this part of the enterprise market. And of course on the PCIe side we believe that the TAM growth will resume next year and we will be ready with our solutions with respect to captive NAND as well as NVMe solutions sometime next year. Again let me be clear captive NAND will be ramping with qualifications during the course of this year.
And then you asked about expenses, you asked about expenses as well and of course we will absolutely make sure that we are continuing to invest in our technology and innovation this is how SanDisk has grown over the course of last 26 years that is innovation in technology and system solutions. This is absolutely the life blood of the company and now we have even more opportunities as we try, as we work on growing the enterprise solutions and work towards leadership position in growing this market. So absolutely we will not be cutting back with respect to our core of technology engineering addressing the market opportunities, the sales force that we need to continue to drive this business. But at the same time we have an opportunity with the streamlined organization that we have just announced to have better benefit of efficiency gains and synergies and this is what we will be leveraging towards this 5% reduction that I mentioned.
Mark Newman
Great, Sanjay. As a follow-up to that thinking about enterprise SSD market more broadly it seems like as the market grows it seems to be getting, the competitive intensity seems to be increasing a bit and what you mentioned SATA versus PCIe what it comes down to what really is, whatâs a combination of obviously quality and performance but also pricing as well, pricing is obviously playing a role there, so I am just wondering clearly the guidance from the company has been for a while that enterprise SSDs can remain at a significantly higher margin than the corporate average, is there any risk to that, is there any risk to that considering these changes you just mentioned?
Sanjay Mehrotra
With respect to the margin opportunities of the enterprise we absolutely continue to believe that margins for enterprise will be higher than corporate margins, of course there is pricing pressures in certain segments of the enterprise market itself, this is where itâs the key to have the benefit of leading edge technology getting into the marketplace as early as possible. And working closely with the customers to get those products qualified in a robust fashion and these are the kind of things we are focused on.
And Mark, you were asking in your earlier question that as a result of any OpEx reductions, does it mean any less products or solutions that we use to address the market. And I would like to make sure that we will absolutely continue to have the broadest portfolio of solutions. We will not take anything of it that is needed in terms of addressing the market requirements with our products. The only thing we are talking about is that in enterprise we are streamlining our products and technology platforms to gain greater efficiencies in terms of being able to scale up the business, but our broadest portfolio will continue to be the broadest in the industry and we will continue to broaden this going forward. And the latest example is InfiniFlash, right, I mean this is our industryâs first big data flash application and these are the kind of solutions where we bring together our hardware capabilities, our software capabilities, and deep understanding of application acceleration and application requirement capabilities through software, some of which we acquired through Fusion-io. These are the kind of things we will be putting together to continue to advance our product and technology roadmap going forward.
Jay Iyer
Thank you, Mark. Vanessa, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, thatâs from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis
Wow, barely made it. Thanks so much for taking the question. The first question is more of a philosophical question on the guidance for calendar â15 and the comments on sequential growth in the third and the fourth quarter. Judy is the underlying assumption there that the business is back to normalized operation at that time or are you still considering that some of the improvement in streamlining thatâs in the business in the second quarter would be impacting the numbers that we should be thinking about?
Judy Bruner
Well, let me answer that in two ways. From an OpEx perspective, we expect to complete our OpEx measures at least the vast majority of those OpEx measures in the second quarter. And so from an OpEx streamlining perspective, yes, I would expect that we are more back to normal in the second half. But from a revenue perspective and a product perspective, we will still be rebuilding in the second half, no question about that. We believe we will return to sequential revenue growth in Q3 and in Q4, but not back to the levels that we believe we should be at. And as I mentioned, for example, we believe our enterprise revenue will stabilize in the second half and in terms of sequential growth and then return to growth momentum in 2016. So, we still will be working on our products, our revenue and our gross margins in the second half.
Craig Ellis
Okay, thatâs helpful. The follow-up is for Sanjay. Sanjay, I think what I am hearing as I listened to you talk about strategy and whatâs happening especially on the enterprise side of the business is that there are improvements that need to be made to address cycle time, customer closeness and those types of issues, but not issues related to gaps in your technology portfolio. Is that correct? And somewhat relatedly, if you donât see the type of improvement that you are looking for over the next three to four quarters, would you start to consider a change in strategy versus the one you have been pursuing over the last few years?
Sanjay Mehrotra
I would say that our strategy is very solid. Our strategy of continuing to increase the mix of high value solutions in our portfolio is the strong strategy and we do have the capabilities to address this. You are right that this is about certain execution lapses that we have had here and we are very much focused on correcting those. There is a great sense of urgency and tremendous focus on our team to address those. Itâs correct that some of these execution-related challenges, particularly those that are tying with the engineering platforms and that requires engineering development, as you know that those kind of engineering programs take few quarters to recover in terms of product readiness that needs some market requirements. So, we are very much focused on that. We are continuing to strengthen our product roadmap, but yes, in terms of execution, it will take us few quarters, several quarters before we are able to have the most complete and solid product roadmap to address the enterprise opportunities fully. However, our strategy absolutely remains solid and we remain very committed to it and continuing to drive our growth in this market.
And I will also point out that in addition to enterprise opportunities, of course, SanDisk opportunities in other parts of our business, such as mobile with continuing adoption of flash, increasing capacity as the smartphones really need more flash to deliver the experience that is needed by the consumers, SanDisk aggressively continues to drive opportunities in mobile, client SSDs continuing to grow our shares with a broad set of customers other than one large customer where we lost significant portion of client SSD business resulting in some of the year-over-year challenges, but client SSDs, the adoption rate for those SSDs and PCs continues to increase and with our vertical integration, thatâs another large opportunity for us and of course SanDisk leadership is retail. So, we are definitely continuing to aggressively drive forward the business on all fronts and I believe we have a very solid strategy here.
