Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DIRECTV's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.
Jonathan M. Rubin
Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2013 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce and Pat for some introductory remarks. But first, I'll read to you the following. On this call, we may make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in each of DIRECTV's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.
Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for financial results, liquidity and capital resources. Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures, which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at directv.com.
With that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.
Michael D. White
Thanks, Jon. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
Before I hit my prepared remarks though, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't take a second to recognize and thank Jon Rubin who'll be retiring at the end of this year, as this will probably be his last conference call after more than he would care to count. Jon, in my experience, is an incredibly professional Head of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. I've worked with a lot in my career, both as a CFO and as a CEO, and I have to say, I think, Jon does a terrific job of listening to our investors, communicating with our investors in a clear way and making sure that I'm always aware of what our investors are thinking. And I think, I'd be remiss, Jon, if I didn't say thank you for all you've done for DIRECTV. And for me, I think, you've been an outstanding representative of our company with our investors, and we will miss you. But we know that you've done a great job training Martin Sheehan, and he'll do a great job as he picks up the mantle after this call. So Jon, thanks for all you've done for us.
So let me turn to our quarter. In the third quarter, DIRECTV's portfolio of businesses across the Americas, I think, delivered another solid quarter of consolidated results, highlighted by both a strong top line coupled with continued operating discipline across the disparate geographies, varying macroeconomic conditions and competitive environments that we operate in.
Specifically, I would have several key takeaways from the quarter. First, we're generating solid top line growth, which I think speaks to the strength of our DIRECTV and Sky brands, and increasing value of our differentiated products and services in the marketplace. Second, our commitment to profitably grow our businesses while keeping a sharp eye on cost and capital spending and productivity improvement was clearly a highlight as our operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded, driving double-digit OPBDA and cash flow growth in the quarter. And finally, we continue to execute on our strategy of aggressively returning capital to our shareholders. As you saw in the earnings release, we repurchased nearly $1.3 billion of DIRECTV's stock in the quarter, which helped fuel a 42% increase in earnings per share to $1.28.
Now before I turn the call over to Pat and Bruce for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin American businesses, let me just offer a couple of observations. Starting with DIRECTV U.S. I really thought our U.S. business had a strong quarter, and to a large degree, the results reflect our overarching goal of balancing top line sales and bottom line profitability in a sustainable way.
Our heightened focus on higher-quality subscribers this year continues to increase the long-term value of the subscriber base that we have and is yielding strong financial returns. These benefits are particularly evident when you look at our revenue growth of 7%, which was primarily driven by our ability to grow ARPU in a challenging U.S. operating environment.
We're also delivering our best-in-class video experience with an enhanced focus on preserving a sustainable cost structure through investments that deliver benefits and drive efficiency. And the benefits we're generating help neutralize the impact of higher programming expenses in the quarter as our U.S. operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin increased 90 basis points compared to last year.
So with these successes, DIRECTV U.S. posted over 11% operating profit before depreciation and amortization growth, marketing -- marking the best third quarter performance in 5 years. Now obviously, let me be clear, we certainly, and I certainly do not expect to generate double-digit OPBDA growth going forward, but it's nice to see in the quarter. But it's equally clear that our U.S. business continues to demonstrate operating strengths that position us nicely to not only meet or exceed our full year 2013 guidance, but also provides me with even more confidence that we can continue to deliver strong growth, both top and bottom line, over the long term.
Moving on to Latin America where during the third quarter, we achieved a major milestone, surpassing 17 million total customers in Brazil, PanAmericana and Mexico. I think, this accomplishment is a true testament to our DIRECTV Latin America leaders' and employees' strong commitment to success, to the strength of our DIRECTV and Sky brands, as well as our best-in-class video experience.
Consistent with recent trends, our subscriber performance was driven by growth from our middle market segments, as well as from advanced product sales in the higher-end A and B households. However, as we had discussed on our last earnings call, more challenging economic and competitive positions in Brazil continue to place upward pressure on churn, particularly among the segment of the middle market with lower credit.
Now importantly, we are making good progress addressing this issue. But as with any major initiative, it does take time to test and refine your policies and offers. Although I expect to see continued improvements in churn over the next several quarters, the trajectory may not necessarily be linear quarter-to-quarter. But ultimately, I'm confident we're taking the appropriate actions in putting the right business practices in place to ensure we can maintain attractive financial returns over the long term.
Turning to the top line in Latin America. Although global currency markets remain volatile, DIRECTV Latin America's local currency revenue growth of 24% was strong and continues to reflect our brand leadership and advantaged competitive position.
And on a local basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU was up 4%, which reflects our pricing power and upgrade strategy even as we bring on a richer mix of middle market subscribers. In terms of margins and the bottom line, Bruce will go into that in a bit more detail, but overall, I thought we did a pretty good job managing our costs in the quarter. In fact, excluding the impact of the ECAD settlement, operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded year-over-year for the first time in 2 years.
So in summary, third quarter results for both the U.S. and Latin American businesses continues to highlight our focus on achieving operational excellence while delivering on the strategic priorities we've put in place of maintaining profitable growth over the long term. In Latin America, we continue to navigate through tough market conditions, both by growing the higher end markets with the best advanced services while also profitably penetrating the middle market segments.
And in the U.S., we're executing on our long-term strategy of balancing top line sales with bottom line profitability while continuing to improve the overall customer service experience and continuing to innovate on digital products such as our DIRECTV Everywhere platform.
With these strategies in place and the many growth opportunities we see in our future, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver superior financial returns to our shareholders for years to come. And I speak for the entire management team when I say that we look forward to sharing a much deeper dive into our strategies for turning these growth opportunities into higher cash flow for all of DIRECTV's stakeholders when we host our Investor Day next month on December 12 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, and I look forward to seeing you all there.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce to talk about DIRECTV Latin America.
Bruce B. Churchill
Great. Thanks, Mike. All in all, I think, DIRECTV Latin America had a decent quarter, with strong financial results and solid new subscriber sales. As Mike mentioned, we surpassed another milestone, reaching 17 million customers in the region, including Sky Mexico.
That said, we continue to work through several challenges, in particular the higher-than-normal churn in Brazil, and foreign exchange headwinds across the region that are weighing on our year-over-year comparisons.
Before discussing our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to take a few minutes and update you on a few specifics. In Brazil, we are still working on addressing the high involuntary churn of our cash-paying middle market subscribers. This is an issue I have spoken about before.
Although we believe we've made significant progress on this front, we do not believe that we have yet fully cracked the code on how best to manage this higher-risk group within our subscriber base. We have implemented new credit policies and sales filters for new subscribers and rethought our retention programs in order to better focus our efforts on those subscribers that we believe will be the most profitable to the company over the longer term. But finding the right balance involves a certain amount of art as well, so fine-tuning the effort will take some more time.
That said, the trends are improving. So I think we're on the right track.
In PanAmericana, limitations on our ability to import subscriber-related equipment in Venezuela, combined with a conscious effort to focus on higher-quality sales in Argentina, put downward pressure, otherwise a very strong quarter in terms of sales in the other countries. Despite these challenges, we believe that our middle market strategies in Brazil and PanAmericana are the right ones for maintaining profitable growth. We will spend some more time on this in our Investor Day in December.
Now on to our results for the quarter. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, our results exclude Sky Mexico, which we do not consolidate.
Gross additions of just over 1 million represents a decline of 5% compared to last year. In PanAmericana, where we surpassed 6 million total subscribers in the quarter, gross additions declined almost 6% versus last year, reflecting the previously mentioned box import limitations in Venezuela, and the increased sales filters on post-paying subscriptions in Argentina.
In Argentina, although challenging macroeconomic conditions and improving subscriber quality efforts have resulted in lower year-over-year sales activity, I consider our sales activity there to be solid, if not strong. The fact is we could sell more subscriptions if we wanted to, but instead we're trying to be more selective given the economic uncertainty. In terms of product mix, approximately 60% of the gross additions in PanAmericana were prepaid gross adds versus 54% a year ago.
In Brazil, gross additions were down 5%, reflecting a combination of the macroeconomic environment and sales filters recently implemented. Our packages targeting the middle market represented approximately 80% of the gross additions in the quarter versus 70% a year ago.
Across the region, middle market subscribers now represent more than 40% of our 11.3 million consolidated subscribers compared to 34% last year. Although our sales of advanced products remain strong, our limited ability to import HD boxes in Venezuela was a primary driver of our lower year-over-year advanced product sales growth.
Excluding Venezuela, sales of advanced products in PanAmericana increased 8%. Today, more than half of our 1.7 million advanced products subscribers in PanAmericana receive our HD service.
In Brazil, when compared to last year, third quarter sales of HD to new subscribers grew slightly. When combined with upgrades of our existing customers, HD subscribers grew more than 35% versus prior year. 1/3 of our Brazilian subscriber base now subscribes to one of our HD products.
Turning to churn. Postpaid churn of 1.93% is higher than last year, reflecting the issues in Brazil I discussed earlier. The higher overall postpaid churn in Brazil neutralizes but has been a great year for churn in PanAmericana where our postpaid churn continues to improve led by Argentina and Venezuela coming in at 1.14% for the quarter.
With regard to our prepaid subscribers in PanAmericana, we saw an increase of 56% of our on subscribers compared to last year, reflecting our strong sales and continued improvement in reconnection rates. As of today, we have over 2 million prepaid on subscribers in PanAmericana. As a reminder, when I refer to our on subscribers, I am only referring to those subscribers that have a paid for and are receiving our signal on the last day of the quarter.
In summary, we added 260,000 subscribers to our base this quarter, and in spite of the churn issues in Brazil, we maintained or increased our market share year-over-year in the majority of our markets.
Now turning to our financial results. Third quarter revenues grew 5% compared to last year or about 24%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, mostly as a result of the 17% increase in our subscriber base. The negative FX impact is a result of weakening currencies in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina versus the U.S. dollar.
Excluding foreign exchange, ARPU increased about 4%, reflecting general price increases and growth in the advanced product base, partially offset by our growth in the lower ARPU middle market segment. DTVLA OPBDA increased 23% to $558 million, which included a gain of approximately $70 million related to a settlement with ECAD, the local organization in Brazil responsible for collecting performance rights fees.
For those of you who are more familiar with the U.S. market, ECAD is analogous to ASCAP and BMI. Excluding the ECAD gain, OPBDA increased 7%, and OPBDA margin improved slightly as inflation adjustments on certain programming contracts in Venezuela and costs associated with special events in PanAmericana were more than offset by lower general and administrative costs in Brazil.
Cash flow before interest and taxes in the quarter of $53 million declined from $81 million a year ago, as higher OPBDA was more than offset by higher purchases of subscriber-related equipment and higher capital outlays for nonsubscriber-related projects that are ongoing.
As always, I would like to take -- make a quick mention of Sky Mexico, whose results were recently released by Televisa. Sky Mexico delivered another strong quarter, adding 233,000 net subscribers in the quarter. Similar to DTVLA, Sky Mexico's results reflected strong performance with its middle market product, as well as sales from the traditional A and B segments. Sky Mexico's HD subscriber base grew nearly 40% in the past year. And financial results at Sky Mexico were also strong with double-digit growth in local currency revenue and OPBDA.
And finally, looking at the remainder of 2013, I expect our most recent full year guidance to remain basically intact with the exception of net subscriber additions, where we now expect the figure to be below the 1.5 million low end of the range that I discussed last quarter, for all of the reasons discussed above.
With that, I'll hand it over to Pat. Pat?
Patrick T. Doyle
Thanks, Bruce, DIRECTV U.S. delivered exceptional third quarter results as our financial and operating performance exceeded both internal and external expectations. As you heard from Mike earlier, these results reflect our strategy to rebalance our top and bottom lines so that we can achieve long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
Looking first at the top line, our industry-leading revenue growth of 7% continues to demonstrate the strength of the DIRECTV brand in the marketplace and was driven by ARPU growth of 6.2%, as well as modest subscriber growth over the last year.
The key driver of this growth, other than price increases, was increased penetration of both new and existing customers paying for advanced services, in particular our whole home DIRECTV Genie, as well as our new enhanced warranty program. Although our total customer base with advanced products is significantly higher, 55% of our subscriber base now has a DIRECTV Genie or an HD DVR, representing a 10 percentage point increase over the prior year period.
In addition, approximately 40% of our customers are now paying an extra $2 for our new enhanced warranty program, which provides additional value to our customers, including the ability to upgrade to our latest product features and functionality every 2 years. It's also important to point out that roughly half of our new customers are signing up for this service.
Pay-per-view, commercial and ad sales also contributed favorably to revenue growth this quarter as each grew at a double-digit clip year-over-year. Pay-per-view revenues benefited from the Mayweather boxing event in the quarter, as well as strong revenue contributions from movie sales led by VOD movie revenues. These strong results continue to highlight the success of our improved HD user interface, DIRECTV CINEMA and Connected Home strategy.
Commercial sales were solid across all 3 categories: bars and restaurants, businesses and private viewing and lodging and institutions, and were mostly driven by our new pricing and packaging strategy. Higher advertising revenue in the quarter was generated mostly by greater contributions from both our new and -- new local and addressable categories, as well as from national sales.
It's also worth noting that we increased our pricing on the NFL SUNDAY TICKET subscription this year. And as a result, we expect to collect higher renewal revenues this year than we did last year.
Turning now to subscribers. DIRECTV U.S. net additions more than doubled the prior year's level to 139,000, driven by lower churn. Gross additions were ahead of our expectations, reflecting the strength of our offer in the marketplace, as well as a modest benefit from both the Time Warner Cable-CBS and DISH-Raycom programming disputes.
Churn in the quarter of 1.61% was also solid as we're continuing to see favorable involuntary churn trends related primarily to our more selective acquisition policy. However, if we exclude the impact of the Viacom dispute in the prior year period, voluntary churn was up slightly, which we continue to attribute to the greater-than-average price increases we implemented this year, coupled with the highly competitive pay TV landscape.
Moving now to the bottom line where strong cost management was clearly a highlight. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin expanded 90 basis points to drive more than 11% OPBDA growth in the quarter. Much of the margin improvement came from our ability to drive strong top line growth, as we just discussed.
In addition, nearly every line item on our income statement came in better than our internal forecast due to disciplined expense management and improved productivity from prior year capital investments. As a result, many of our key cost areas, including subscriber services, broadcast operations and subscriber acquisition expenses, grew slower than revenues. Partially offsetting these improvements were increased content cost, primarily related to annual programmer rate increases.
That said, ACPU is coming in a touch better than we had expected this year, as we remain extremely disciplined in our negotiations, and with our approach towards launching new networks. And consistent with our full year guidance, cash upgrade and retention costs, which includes capitalized set-top boxes, were also higher in the quarter as we continue to execute on our strategy to reward our most loyal subscribers and manage churn with upgrade offers for our DIRECTV Genie entertainment experience.
Lastly, the cash SAC rate of $853 in the quarter was a touch below our expectations, due principally to the timing of our national advertising spend, along with better-than-expected gross additions coming from our direct sales channel, which has a lower SAC relative to other channels. Looking ahead at next quarter, we continue to expect a solid performance in terms of top and bottom line growth, although clearly not to the extent we saw in the quarter.
Moving on to our consolidated third quarter results. DIRECTV continues to generate solid bottom line growth as diluted earnings per share increased 42% to $1.28 in the quarter. It's worth noting that while we did record a $9 million functional currency loss in other net on our consolidated P&L in the quarter, we recently settled the $210 million intercompany loan between Sky Brazil and DIRECTV Inc. As a result, our U.S. dollar-denominated net liabilities are now half as large, and the future P&L impact from both favorable and unfavorable changes in the Brazilian real will be 50% smaller.
Free cash flow also improved 17% in the quarter, driven primarily by higher OPBDA and favorable working capital, partially offset by higher capitalized hardware costs related to increased penetration of new and existing customers taking our DIRECTV Genie entertainment experience. Free cash flow was also impacted by higher net interest due to the timing of payments and higher debt balances, as well as a $92 million payment to settle the ECAD dispute in Brazil.
Also in the quarter, we purchased 21.1 million shares of DIRECTV stock for nearly $1.3 billion, bringing cumulative repurchases since we began the program in 2006 to nearly $29 billion or 64% of shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 58 million shares of DIRECTV stock for $3.2 billion. We are still targeting roughly $4 billion of buybacks in 2013.
In addition, we have approximately $1.6 billion remaining on our current authorization, which should carry our repurchase program into the beginning of 2014. We ended the quarter with almost $19.3 billion in total debt, bringing our total debt to trailing consolidated OPBDA leverage ratio to about 2.5x.
In summary, I thought we had a strong quarter as we continue to deliver on the strategies we outlined for our U.S. business and remain on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance at DIRECTV U.S. And as Bruce mentioned a few minutes ago, DIRECTV Latin America's revenue and OPBDA guidance remains intact as we make progress addressing the higher churn in Brazil. So if we successfully execute on these goals and continue to be disciplined in managing cost, I'm confident that we will deliver on our full year earnings per share target of $5 in 2013.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jon.
Jonathan M. Rubin
Thanks, Pat. Before moving on to Q&A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance other than the representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we are webcasting this call live on the Internet, and an archived copy will be kept on our website. [Operator Instructions] So with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Mike, when you joined, you talked a lot about managing or building loyalty with your customer base and investing in your best customers. It seems like looking at the churn results this year and also the yield on your price increases, [indiscernible] with ARPU that you've had a lot of success, you talked about the Genie penetration rate and some of the warranty programs stuff. Do you think the company is now at a place where you're satisfied going forward, you can continue to grow this business on the back of some of these investments or is there a lot more work you see ahead to kind of keep this mid single-digit annual U.S. growth rate intact that you've actually, I think, probably exceeded at least in the first 3-year series you gave us a couple of years ago?
Michael D. White
Well, I mean, let's take that as 2 separate parts, Ben, the kind of algorithm of the financial outlook versus the customer experience initiatives. Look, I'm real proud of the accomplishments of our team and the things that we've been doing around customer loyalty this year. But we still have a long way to go. I mean, some of the things you don't know, I mean, part of the way we're getting the productivity, we eliminated 4.5 million calls in escalations this year. I think, it's huge when you look at the way that impacts your subscriber service expense, and it also improves the customer experience with DIRECTV. We've trained more than 5,000 front-line employees on continuous improvement. We've launched a new help center on directv.com, including chat. And we're also about ready to roll out a new simplified bill next year. So I think, we've done a lot of really good stuff. The -- in terms of the upgrade program this year, we'll have upgraded 3 million of our existing customers to our latest technology, which I also think is huge. So I feel great about the progress we're making, Ben. But it's also pretty clear, when I kind of dig underneath the churn numbers, that we're still seeing some elevated issues from the price increases we took this year. And I don't think any of us in the industry can sleep well if we're going to have to continue to take these kinds of price increases going forward in terms of its impact on customer loyalty across the industry. So I think we've still got a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of great initiatives for next year, which we'll talk about at our December meeting on the customer experience in particular. And certainly, all of that continues to give me confidence that we can continue to deliver the algorithm that we've talked about of mid single-digit revenue and OPBDA in the U.S. business. You're right, we'll be probably a tad ahead of that this year. We haven't yet finalized our plans for next year and we'll talk about that in December. But certainly, kind of the way we've been able to both manage our costs, and I think, frankly, that continues to be an even bigger focus for us internally, coupled with the customer experience and the product innovation, I think those 3 drivers are critical for us to be able to continue to get sustainable pricing from our customers, keep our costs under control to deliver that algorithm. But yes, I come out of this year feeling very good about the progress that we've made and the confidence in the longer-term algorithm.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Great. If I could just ask a quick follow-up to Bruce on LatAm. Bruce, the full year guidance for revenue growth, which I believe is 10%, implies an acceleration a bit in Q4. I just wanted to confirm that, and maybe you could give us some color on sort of what you're expecting on the drivers to get to that higher revenue growth that we saw in Q3?
Bruce B. Churchill
Well, I think, we're sort of 10%, and then mid single-digit OPBDA growth was what we gave in the last quarter. Ben, I think, look, I don't exactly know what numbers you're referring to as far as the need to accelerate. But I think, if we consistently deliver for next quarter what our expectations are, and I don't think we have to have huge acceleration in order to throw out the numbers that we guided to. So I'm not exactly sure I agree with your statement that there needs to be acceleration in order to make those numbers.
Michael D. White
Yes, no. I think, I'm not sure how we parse the sentence. I mean, I think, certainly, we should be, for the full year, high single-digits or 10, somewhere in that range, Ben, but you still got some ForEx issues. And again, remember, for the Brazilian real, it probably cost us 13 points in the quarter with the deval that we experienced. So on local currency, we actually had a very good quarter in terms of revenues and profits in Brazil. But then you turn it into the dollars with that kind of a deval, that's pretty significant. And I'm not sure that, that gets a lot better in the fourth quarter. But -- so, I mean, again, we'll update more of that on the December call when we're together.
Operator
And now we'll take a question from Bryan Kraft with Evercore.
Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division
Wanted to ask one on Latin America, Bruce, what kind of impact are you seeing from AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil quad-play launch in Brazil, and how are you thinking about EchoStar potentially partnering with GVT and that having an impact on the business? And then, on the U.S., I just wanted to ask, can you comment on the paying SUNDAY TICKET subscriber count now? And how much of the ARPU increase is because of the higher SUNDAY TICKET pricing?
Bruce B. Churchill
I'll take the Latin America question first. I mean, I would say we haven't really seen any big impact from the AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil offer. As I said, to the extent that there were any decline in sales in Brazil, that really came more from actions we took ourselves in terms of tightening the credit filters. And with respect to a GVT-EchoStar partnership, very difficult to comment because while they've announced that they've come to an agreement, and I believe they have filed something with the local authorities in Brazil, the details are not -- haven't been confirmed publicly. So at this stage, it's pretty speculative. But look, in general, I would, I think, make a comment that we've made over the years. We've been competing for a long time. It's always been a very competitive market. We believe that we are well-positioned and well-prepared to take on any competition that may arise, not that I underestimate EchoStar or GVT in any way, but I think we're well-positioned. So it doesn't dramatically change the landscape, as far as I'm concerned.
Michael D. White
Brian, it's Mike. In terms of the U.S. questions, look, we're real pleased with the performance of SUNDAY TICKET in the quarter. We had some things that went positive and some things went the other way, but net-net, ended up probably just a tad better than what our expectations were. We had more renewals than we were expecting, but we had fewer folks that historically never got SUNDAY TICKET that raised their hand and say, I want to pay for it. But net-net, in the quarter, we were pleased and we were kind of somewhat ahead of our expectations in terms of NFL SUNDAY TICKET. In terms of its impact on ARPU, gosh, I don't think it's that material. I mean, it helped a tad. Just trying to look at the number here. But I wouldn't say out of the total increase in ARPU, let's see, we went from what, 96 to 102, we're talking kind of dimes, if you will, of the increment from that, not more than that. So I'm not sure that was as big a driver of ARPU as you're thinking. Hey, with all that said, look, we had a -- I really was pleased with the marketing and the take rates that we got on NFL SUNDAY TICKET. I think it certainly contributed to our positive gross adds in the quarter. And you didn't ask the question, but I figured somebody will, so I'll just kind of throw it out right now. Look, next year is the 20th anniversary of our NFL-DIRECTV partnership. And certainly speaking on my behalf and DIRECTV's behalf, we don't want it to be our last. And I know that speculation can make for exciting for headlines, but the reality is we are having good talks with the NFL, and those talks are progressing. I continue to be optimistic we will get an exclusive deal done, but deals like this increasingly in this world are complicated and not just about economics. They take some time to work through, but we continue to be focused on growing the NFL SUNDAY TICKET business beyond what it is today. And as I said, I'm very optimistic that we will continue that partnership.
Operator
And next, we'll hear from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.
Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just a couple of questions. The first on the competitive environment across your markets. With all the MSOs building out their video product like Chatter, for example, going all digital in their markets and so on, how has that changed, if you could give us some sense of what that environment looks like? And also, from a Latin America perspective, given that some of the lack of growth during this quarter was basically because you tightened credit conditions and so on, should we expect this to continue going forward in terms of the credit standards and so on that you implement there?
Michael D. White
So Kannan, in terms of the U.S. business, I think, we've said this before, I don't think it was all that different in the quarter. I mean, it is a highly competitive industry, and I think that's been true for a very, very long time. It's certainly gotten more true with the telcos entering the business and being very, very aggressive in the second and third quarter with their cash back offers. And I think you've seen the MSO -- the cable companies react to that. For us, this is the new reality. I think, it's probably true in most industries that we are now in a world of hyper competition. And that just means you got to run faster and lace your sneakers on when you get up every morning. It means you got to do a better job on the customer experience. You got to continue to aggressively innovate around your product, and you got to be smart in how you manage your brand and your top and bottom lines from a productivity standpoint. But I wouldn't say looking back at the quarter or the year was more or less competitive. In my mind, it's very competitive. And certainly, this year in particular, probably some of the cash back offers have been quite aggressive that we've had to compete against. But it's not a new thing for us. I think it, in my mind, is likely to be welcome to the rest of our lives that we have to run hard. It's a very competitive space.
Bruce B. Churchill
On the issue of sort of the sales levels and how it relates to credit standards, I guess, my general comment would be, yes, I would expect the credit standards and the tightened standards to remain in place. Having said that, those are mostly in place for postpaid subscribers to whom we are providing equipment and expecting them to pay a bill once they receive it after the fact. So that's one set of subscribers. On the other hand, we still have our prepaid subscribers and prepaid offers, which work well for those subscribers that don't qualify. And that is the kind of thing that we're beginning to test and experiment with a bit more in Brazil to see if we can expand the base and open up the base of people to whom we sell. So that we return to the kind of more traditional growth pace that we've seen in the past. So I wouldn't necessarily associate continued tightened credit standards with continued lower sales. And I think, frankly, the other thing is a practical matter, if you're managing a sales force, whenever you change it and you make it tougher to sell, there's always a period that requires the sales force to adapt a bit before you get back to where you were. So that probably had a -- played a factor a bit this quarter as well.

We'll take a question from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Can you give us an idea of the economics on the warranty program, how profitable is that? Are there any other opportunities like that you have to add just a few dollars here and there that could help the bottom line? And then, any more impediments on getting the Genie product rolled out more broadly to the base? What's sort of your expectation for when you can see that on a much broader scale? Is it an equipment issue or is it getting some systems and processes in place to be able to really push that out on a faster level?
Michael D. White
So Frank, the question on the warranty program, I appreciate. Look, we've had, to your point, this year, and I guess this goes at the increase in ARPU, we've had a number of things that have contributed, one of which has been the enhanced protection program for which we've gotten a great take rate from customers. And it is very profitable for us. As you know, we raised the price $2, and I think, something on the order of 40% of our customer base takes that program. So it's not a small program, and it has enabled us, in particular, with the Genie product, to accelerate rolling out upgrades of our existing customers to a new technology. So I don't expect to get a price increase out of that thing next year, but it has been a nice contributor, and it's very profitable for DIRECTV. But this was a real win-win in that we got some pricing, which helped ARPU, but we also enhanced the customer experience by doing this free upgrades every 2 years. So I was really pleased with that. We also had upsides in pay-per-view, and ad sales and commercial, which were also nice contributors to growth in our ARPU. In terms of the Genie, the further Genie rollout piece, I wouldn't say it's an equipment issue or anything else. It's frankly kind of how aggressive do you want to make the offers to your existing base, and you have to recognize that's capital. So in my mind, I tend to look at both upgrade and retention capital spending and SAC as kind of all capital. And sometimes, you're pushing more SAC, and sometimes you're pushing more upgrade and retention. Certainly, this year, we made a conscious choice, and I think we talked about it at the beginning of the year, that we would be spending quite a bit more than we had in the past on upgrade and retention. And that's certainly true for our U.S. business now I'm talking about. In fact, I think, if you look at our total this year, we'll probably spend $350 million more in cash spending on upgrade and retention. And that's been a conscious choice that we made as part of managing our overall algorithm to enhance that customer experience. So -- but we, as I said earlier, we upgraded 3 million. We've got more to go, but I think we're on a good sustainable pace. And in my mind, look, there's always new technology coming. We've got a new box coming next year, and we'll talk about that at the Investor Day. So I think what you want to do is not maximize how many Genies you can place, but get on to a sustainable pace with a program that recognizes your most loyal and most valuable customers and ensures that you're not taking advantage of them while you're giving away free equipment to new customers because they are your most profitable customers and your best customers.

Our next question comes from Tuna Amobi with S&P.
Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research
So Bruce, can you perhaps elaborate on the limitations in Venezuela regarding the set-top box is something you called out this quarter. I don't know if it's a situation that is expected to abate and how that impacts your capital allocation within Venezuela and LatAm in general. So if you can provide color on that, that would be helpful. And separately -- okay, go ahead. Sorry.
Bruce B. Churchill
Go ahead, what's your other question?
Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research
My other question is on the U.S. I guess, this is for Mike. So it seems like the -- you called out the dispute between DISH and Raycom, Time Warner, CBS as a potential source of gross adds. I'm not sure how big that was a factor, number one. And number two, did you actively seek to take advantage of that? And if not, why not? Because I think, at the time that you guys had the dispute with Viacom, that it seems to me that some of your peers were trying to pick off some of your subscribers, which evidently was a factor in your intervening quarter. So if you can comment on that, that would be helpful.
Bruce B. Churchill
Okay. Why don't I start with the Venezuela question. For quite a long time now, we have had a policy of only reinvesting to grow our business in Venezuela with currency that we can actually exchange in Venezuela to purchase new equipment, subscriber equipment. And for a number of years, that was a little easier to do. It appears to have gotten a little more difficult. We do that through a process, which is a government-sanctioned process that actually was originally developed for improving the importation of equipment for the telecoms industry. And a couple of years ago, it got expanded to include pay televisions, include satellite boxes, cable boxes, et cetera. So we've used that program now for a couple of 2 or 3 years now. We were awaiting approval of the third tranche. We had expected it honestly to come in earlier in the year. It seems to have taken a longer time. So as a result, for pretty much the full third quarter, we had very little equipment on hand to sell to customers. I do -- there are some signs now that we're getting some movement, which should enable us to provide some sales and have some equipment available in the market in the last months of this year and I hope into part of next year, but we still don't have definitively how much equipment that will be. But it does appear at least for this next tranche to be loosening up a bit, but it's basically driven by the fact that we're only going to spend money in Venezuela that we can -- which we can fund locally effectively.
Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research
Okay...
Michael D. White
On the U.S. -- sorry, go ahead, did you have a Latin America follow-up with Bruce?
Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research
No, I was just thanking him for that answer. That was helpful.
Michael D. White
Okay. So on the U.S., Tuna, first on the DISH-Raycom and the Time Warner Cable thing, we did do a quick analysis by geography. Those geographic footprints aren't that huge on a national company like ours. So in fact, on our gross adds, it was very modest, I can tell you, well less than 5% of our gross adds, well less. So it had a small impact, but it was on the margin, it was kind of a whipped cream on top of the gross adds or net adds in the quarter. It certainly wasn't a big chunk by any stretch of the imagination. In terms of kind of taking advantage, we've made it a policy, I made it a policy decision a couple of years ago that we would not try and take advantage of these circumstances. I don't think it's in any distributor's interest to do so. I recognize that not all of my distributor friends share that philosophy. I just don't think it's smart because what goes around comes around on these programming disputes.
Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research
Okay. That's understood. And separately, just a quick follow-up on a separate topic, set-top box data, I know you're getting more granular data. Can you provide any color on the kind of data and how useful that is in terms of your programming negotiations and what kind of takeaway that you have, especially including potential impact on -- of SVOD viewing on some of your linear programming. So just generally any kind of granular take on your -- on the data that you have. I know it's proprietary, but I would love to hear your thoughts on that.
Michael D. White
Yes. We, kind of between the sales and marketing team and the programming team, always meet before we head into negotiations on any programming contract and kind of look at all of our set-top box data, and we even look at it by geography when it comes to regional supports network within zones. And I think it is a useful tool to inform those negotiations. If someone's looking for quite a bit more money than their ratings will justify, we make that very clear that we're not prepared to agree to that. But it's an art, not a science. I mean, I think, it is a very, very helpful tool. And frankly, every negotiation now is pretty data-based as a piece of it. But as I said, there's more than one thing that kind of colors those discussions. So I would say it's -- it could be particularly helpful on smaller channels, to be honest with you. The other use for it though, Tuna, has been for addressable advertising, and there it's been very helpful for us. We had an example in the quarter. I mean, we had double-digit growth in ad sales, by the way, leveraged by our addressable ad campaigns. And we had one example was working with one of the automotive companies to do a promotion for a truck, and we were able to match an Experian database with our set-top box data to find folks that would be in the market for an automobile. So we were able to be very, very targeted because of that data. And as a result, they're seeing a 26% ROI on that investment, and we're also able for them to promise that those ads that get shown are actually without wastage. So it's quite useful in a number of respects. It helps on the programming negotiations. And obviously, it also helps us as we thing about addressable ads and where we're going from here.

And now, we'll take a question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.
Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I have 2 questions. They're separate. The first, can you talk about your thoughts and your ability to maybe employ an ARIO-type technology we've been reading in the press? This might be something that you're thinking about. And then, secondly, just want to know what your thoughts are on cable consolidation and how this might impact DIRECTV U.S., if it does happen?
Michael D. White
Sure. Look, we have an integrated -- we've had an integrated tuner. We've had antennas before, Marci. So we're pretty experienced in the whole subject of antennas. We have done some work this year to see, whether from an R&D standpoint, we might see additional ideas going forward that could be leveraged. I don't have anything imminent, and I don't think speculating on ARIO makes a lot of sense. That's kind of a unique business in and of itself. But clearly, if retransmission fees continue to double, and ours are up 50% this year, there is a point of which customers are going to insist they'll save the money and put up an antenna on their home. So we are trying to anticipate, with new technologies, what we might be able to do. But I don't think there's anything that we've got that's imminent in that regard. And mostly, as I said, it's a function of what level of discipline we see over retransmission fees. And if they continue to explode at 50% or 100%, then I think customers are going to demand other alternatives. But hopefully, that won't be the case even though they're up 50% this year. So we continue to explore it, but I don't have anything imminent or specific that I'd comment on. And as I said, ARIO is kind of a unique thing in and of itself. We'll see as that winds its way through the courts what they have to say about it. On cable consolidation, I think, I probably would say more generally about industry consolidation of distributors that given the power that the media companies and sports have at this point, I mean, I think, inadvertently, the government kind of tilted the field in one direction. And you see that in customers' bills growing at 4%, 5% a year. And I think that isn't a sustainable thing for an environment where customers' incomes aren't growing anywhere close to that. So if there's going to be consolidation, whether of cable or otherwise in the industry, over time, I think, that's one of the ways that the market would respond to rewrite the balance between distributors and producers of content. Specifically, in the case of cable consolidation, I don't think it would change our strategies at all. I mean, both Charter and Time Warner Cable have been aggressive competitors. Certainly, recently, Charter has been very aggressive in what it's trying to do in the marketplace. So it's doesn't, in my mind, change that. If anything, I guess, I would view having stronger distributors that will negotiate tough on content fees given how outrageous the increases have been is a good thing, and we would certainly welcome that. But beyond that, I don't think it would change my thinking on consolidation. We'd still be the -- we'd still have 20 million subs, and they have less than that so.

And next, we'll hear from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.
Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP
Just a very quick one for me. I'm wondering if there's any -- if there's a way to quantify the impact to gross adds this quarter from the programming dispute at your competitors?
Michael D. White
I commented on that one on the last question or the one before that, Jonathan, which was it was very, very modest. I mean, we looked at it geographically, and as I said, well less than 5% of our gross adds we can attribute to that. So well less. Low single-digits as a percent. So not very material.
Operator
And we'll now hear from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.
Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
A couple of questions. First, Bruce, I believe, in the past, you've talked about raising prices with inflation in the local markets, but there often being a lag. Can you talk about, as we sort of get to the second half of the year, have all your inflationary price increases been pushed through and reflected in the 3Q results or is there more coming in 4Q or later?
Bruce B. Churchill
We have -- we did put through some price increases. The economies where that's probably the most challenging are obviously the high inflation economies, specifically Argentina and Venezuela, maybe a little bit more inflation these days in Brazil. But -- and both the governments of Brazil and -- sorry, of Argentina and Venezuela, to some extent, put some restraints on our ability to raise prices. So it is getting a little harder. We did put through a price increase in Venezuela this year. We'll yet to see whether we'd do that again. But we try and as best we can to continue to raise prices to match inflation. So we did -- as I said, we put some through. We'll see -- there's a chance we may do one more before the end of the year, but nothing definitive at this time.
Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
All right. [indiscernible] Mike, you talked a lot about the competitive environment this call. It's interesting. Can you help us understand, is the voluntary churn, and it might not be a big increase, but is it spread out across your customer base, is it focused on just the lower end or the higher end? Because the other factors we have to consider is you've got some cable operators that are getting more competitive. And obviously, you have the highest ARPU in the group. So you talk about running faster, and I just want to make sure we understand sort of in what way, is it beyond just promotional offers that are a little bit more aggressive?
Michael D. White
Yes. It's a mixed bag, Doug, and it probably is across the base. I mean, you see some high end and some less high end, and the reason it's a little bit hard because when I look at our gross adds and where they came from, they were -- they continue to come from far and away, mostly cable and telcos, okay? I mean, that's far and away the biggest chunk. And if I look at it even versus prior years, if anything, it was up just a touch from that source. On the other hand, I would tell you that we've also lost some subs to these triple-play cash back offers. So it's a bit of a mixed bag. And I think, certainly, that as an industry without significant kind of volume being driven by new housing, you find all of the distributors scrambling for gross adds. And yet, at the same time, all of us with the programming cost problem trying to raise prices, which kind of has a tendency to send our customers into the marketplace to get a better deal. So it is what it is. I actually think we did a very good job of managing it and have this year, both this year and in the quarter in particular.
Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So as you look forward, do you think about differentiating your product at all through either more specific content off the satellites or bundling or offering over-the-top content to provide further differentiation or is that something that's a little bit too early to pursue?
Michael D. White
Well, I think, you have to differentiate your service in more than one dimension. That's why we're working so hard on the customer service experience, on launching great new products like Genie and voice search, which we've got coming up, on overhauling all of our mobile apps for a common look and feel, on building out our DIRECTV Everywhere offerings and our on-demand offerings. You've got to do it all on kind of building your brand. And I -- our sales and marketing guys continue to do a world-class job building our brand. I think, as it comes to kind of distinctive content, if I thought signing up a show would drive an extra 1 million net adds, I guess I'd look at it. I just don't think we're in that kind of an environment. So we have done some really good stuff from a content standpoint, and we'll continue to do so with our 101 channel. I'm really pleased with the job our team is doing there. But frankly, our biggest original content is probably NFL SUNDAY TICKET. We're focused on trying to renew that deal right now.

And we'll now take a question from Michael Senno with Credit Suisse.
Michael Senno - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just had a question, you guys pursued GVT earlier in the year, also made an aggressive bid for Hulu. What's your appetite for M&A, particularly in Latin America with a lot of the changing dynamics in the competitive environment and on the acquisition front down there?
Michael D. White
I think, look, Michael, we'll look at things as they come across the transom. I think, right now, we're focused on building our business. We've acquired some spectrum that we want to build out to offer a broadband service to the home in Latin America. We're always open for business, and we oftentimes get to look at things. I don't have anything kind of imminent. I think, I've been clear in the past that our first priority is always to reinvest in our business, whether it be organically or through acquisition in ways that would create shareholder value. But we have a fairly unique business model, and there aren't that many acquisitions that come along that would be a hand-in-glove fit for us. But we always look at kind of does this thing, whatever it is, does it accelerate something we're trying to do with our core business or take us to someplace we couldn't otherwise get? Can we kind of deliver sufficient tangible synergies to offset the premium you have to pay and still create attractive returns for our shareholders? And can we manage it, and does it have a culture that would be compatible with our culture? Because a lot of M&A deals fall apart over the culture issue. But -- so, I mean, we'll continue to be opportunistic, I would say, but I don't have anything imminent at the moment on my list.

And now, we'll hear from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities.
Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
I was curious, your friends at Televisa and Sky Mexico have a business of incredible household penetration. I think, the ARPU is only about the equivalent of $20. Obviously, they're reaching down much further in the C, D demographic than you are. But is there anything you can take from their business that's applicable to your entry in the lower market levels down further south or is it really just completely irrelevant a market that's kind of developed on its own course? And then, secondly, at your Investor Day, I suspect you'll be rolling out lots of 84 and Samsung 4K TVs, but can you talk about -- some people say that with CCAP the cable companies would be able to manage that migration. And some people think the satellite companies would have a big edge if 4K really took off. But do you see that getting adapted by the consumer maybe a little faster than people would have thought a while ago and can you talk a bit about your positioning for that?
Bruce B. Churchill
Sure. Well, responding first to the Mexico analogy. The reality is that actually we launched the whole prepaid model first. So in many ways, it was my good friends at Televisa and Sky Mexico who followed us. So look, I think it's something we will continue to do. I've spoken many times about the real opportunity being in the middle market, not to say that we take our eye off the ball, the traditional A, B households because I think we have great products and the best products for those households as well. But obviously, penetration levels in the sort of middle market households is much lower, and the number of those households is higher. So that's clearly where the opportunity is going to be, and I think we'll continue to look to all kinds of opportunities, whether it's tweaking or fine-tuning our existing prepaid or using hybrids of a prepaid and postpaid as they do at Sky Mexico, whatever is the right fit for any given territory, and we'll -- clearly, those are the opportunities we'll be chasing.
Michael D. White
I think, on the 4K question, Matthew, look, we're all working on kind of the technology that it would take to deliver a 4K experience to our customers. But with that said, from all those I talked to, both on the content side and on the distributor side, after the experience with 3D, I think there's a level of, I don't want to say cautiousness, but protect your options because it's a very complex rollout that would be required. I mean, the consumer needs a new TV set, they need a different set-top box, you've got different compressions that you've got to have to deliver, you've got to shoot in 4K or you got have some way to upconvert. Everybody's working on pieces of that, and I do think you will see a little bit more of it next year. But gosh, you're still talking a very, very few homes in America that would have a TV capable of that. But we are working on it. I think, I've said that publicly before. I think, we've also said more likely for any kind of material impact, you're talking 2015 or 2016, to get all of these parts to come together. The content guys I talked to are being a little cautious having been burnt by 3D as well in terms of when they're going to shoot in 4K. So I think we are -- we're working for our -- from a DIRECTV standpoint to make sure we're going to be ready. And we'll continue to innovate, and we hope to be there first with the best experience, the best sound and the best picture, as we always have, and that's our commitment, but I don't have much more to comment on that right at the moment, I would say. We may have some more to say at the December day.
Patrick T. Doyle
Yes, I think, Matthew, the one thing is even though our DIRECTV '14 and '15 satellites weren't necessarily designed and procured thinking about 4K, but the launch of those satellites next year or maybe early in '15, to the extent 4K takes off and is popular, and there's a lot of demand, we're in a good position as far as capacity.

And our last question comes from Todd Mitchell with Brean Capital.
Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division
I want to ask a little bit following up on a bunch of questions here but kind of in the tone of your sources of gross adds coming from cable and telco, are you seeing an increasing trend where you're bundled with these broadband providers, and you're the primary TV provider. And then, what I wanted to bring that into is the over-the-top efforts that you have, can you give us some more color, I mean, you kind of give us the pay-per-view, you give us the number of titles that you have available at directv.com, the number of titles that are sort of available on the HD DVRs that are connected, but can you kind of talk to us about some of the usage metrics and what you're seeing there and how you're thinking about your sort of emerging over-the-top effort?
Michael D. White
Yes, sure. I think, if you look at the whole over-the-top space, Todd, I mean, we had a very good quarter in movies. I'm trying to remember the specifics on the number of movies. Pat, if you have it top of mind, but I mean, we were up double-digits in our movies in the quarter, subscription VOD movies, and very, very pleased with that. I'm trying to see it here, but we also had the Mayweather fight, as Pat talked about, that was also a very, very strong positive. But I would expect in terms of that, that we'll continue to see strong growth in pay-per-view as we're able to offer the best most recent, most current titles for our customers. In terms of other over-the-top ideas, I think, I've said that we continue to explore other ideas, but they're not likely to be a general service like a Hulu just because there isn't another Hulu out there, but they would tend to be more targeted. And we'll see how that goes. We've got some ideas I'm not ready to talk about yet in terms of things that we're looking at for our over-the-top initiative. But I don't know, Pat, is there anything else you wanted to comment on, on that?
Patrick T. Doyle
Yes, I mean, like you said, Mike, I think, if you look at year-over-year, we were up about 800,000 buys on pay-per-view movies.
Michael D. White
There it is.
Patrick T. Doyle
I mean, the other thing that we've talked about is our initiative to get more homes connected, we're at about 4.5 million homes that are connected to broadband today. We're going at a clip of about 1.5 million Connected Homes a year. We're seeing over $3 more of pay-per-view revenue, VOD revenue coming out of homes that are connected versus those that are not connected. So that's still a big. I mean, it's, for us, Connecting Home is more about -- more than just pay-per-view. There's a lot of experience stuff that goes along with it. But it is one of our main initiatives to try to drive more revenue into the home as well.
Michael D. White
Movie buys are up 14% year-to-date, Todd. So that's pretty good.
Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division
Okay. I guess, outside of the premium though, is there anything you could give us in terms of, I guess, 2 aspects of this, the take rate on the apps you have on connected devices on the iOS devices, what kind of level of penetration you're getting with that or traction there even qualitatively? And also, I mean, what we've seen with so many of these over-the-top providers, it's just a change in the way people are viewing, and so binge viewing of series, I mean, are you seeing any of that and is your intention to be able to offer sort of that expanded window to your customers?
Michael D. White
Yes. I don't think I could point to us seeing a significant amount of binge viewing. I know Netflix has bought. Look, the biggest users of our over-the-top stuff tend to be folks streaming premium. So Starz, SHOWTIME and HBO, and they have prior seasons on there. So you can binge view as much as you want of the premiums, and that tends to be, right now, I would say, if you look at our streaming, the volume of streaming, if you will, most of it tends to be premium services. Now I think that will evolve, frankly, the offerings from the cable channels and the broadcast channels have lagged a bit but they'll catch up as the rights evolve over the next year or 2. And then, we'll see how it gets used by the customer base. Right now, we have seen a significant uptick in the use of on-demand as we've added more and more on-demand channels. And we've got more that we'll be launching later this year. So like with everybody, I think, our TV Everywhere stuff, if you will, is very much a work in process. I'm real pleased with it, but it's still very in its early days. And in terms of the, gosh, the amount of streaming, just if you take the NFL as an example, out of our 2 million-plus NFL subscribers, those that take the SUNDAY TICKET product on any given Sunday, you might have 200,000 of them that are streaming. So it's healthy, but it's not mainstream yet by any means.
