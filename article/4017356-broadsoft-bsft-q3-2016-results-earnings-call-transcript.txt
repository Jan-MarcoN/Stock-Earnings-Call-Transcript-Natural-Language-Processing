I will now turn the call over to BroadSoft's President and CEO, Michael Tessler. Mike?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thanks, Chris, and good morning and thanks for taking the time to discuss our third quarter 2016 results. We had another strong quarter as we achieved total revenue growth of 22% and earnings growth of 41%. As usual, Jim will provide additional details about our financial performance later in our prepared remarks.
Similar to last quarter, I'd like to lead off my remarks with some exciting customer news. I'm very happy to note that BroadWorks is the platform that powers Verizon Wireless' One Talk service. As you may know from TV, online and radio ads that Verizon has been running, One Talk is a true mobile first communication solution designed to increase productivity for small-to-medium sized businesses and their employees. Users have access to a range of large enterprise-like communication features from a single phone number that works seamlessly across a mobile phone, as well as a desktop. Live calls can even be moved back and forth between different devices.
Verizon is complementing its extensive marketing effort with a broad sales distribution strategy across its retail store base through its high-touch B2B sales and also through channel partners. There are several important takeaways from this product rollout. First, this is an offering based on Verizon's 4G VoLTE network. We've previously talked about voice over LTE as being a catalyst for business-focused services. One Talk is our first significant U.S. proof point of that opportunity, but it's certainly won't be the last.
Second, it's interesting that One Talk is VoLTE based with a bigger picture that is a mobile offering and that's similar to recent service rollouts, such as Rogers Unison and Vodafone Germany's One Net. The key point I want to emphasize here is that these are all examples of our service provider customers leveraging their wireless networks to enable new compelling UC offers. This is an important point of differentiation by offering a solution as deeply integrated into the wireless network, a service provider creates a mobility centric user experience that OTP vendors would find difficult to replicate.
In turn, the ability to provide a great mobile experience is becoming much more important. In the U.S. today, there are close to 30 million small business, and upwards of 90% of these businesses have employees that work away from the office. IDC estimates that by 2020 in the U.S. overall, 75% of the workforce will be mobile. Verizon Wireless' One Talk service is a great service squarely aimed at this demographic, and we have high expectations for its commercial success.
In addition to the Verizon announcement, I also want to take a moment to share with you another piece of important customer news. This past quarter, we've signed the single largest deal in BroadSoft's history. While I can't go into all the details, it was a three-year software deal with an existing international customer that grows in value each year.
It will contribute about $11 million of billings this year, with billings growing incrementally in 2017 and then again, 2018. I think this deal highlights the level of trust and confidence our customers have in BroadSoft and our solutions. Certainly, a deal of this nature doesn't happen overnight, and it's a culmination of hard work by a lot of people at both BroadSoft and our customer. So I do want to say thank you to everyone involved. We at BroadSoft look forward to continuing to build an already great relationship for many years to come.
One of the events that helps us build on our customer relationships is our annual users conference, BroadSoft Connections, which we'll be hosting in a few weeks. At Connections, we gather key executives from across our customer base and partner community to update them on our vision and new product solutions. We at BroadSoft benefit greatly as well in all the interactions and brain storming that occur, having so many of the industry's thought leaders together in the same room.
This is our 14th consecutive Connections event, and I expect this year's to be the largest and best ever. Our theme this year is Let's Change the Game. We've already discussed with you how end-user requirements and demographics are continuing to evolve. To us, changing the game is proactively addressing these market shifts, and providing even more value to our customers, partners and end-users.
We will achieve this through continuous innovation across our broad portfolio of unified communications, contact center and team collaboration solutions, and enhanced digital marketing efforts in support of our service provider channel. While I won't front run our own show by going through specifics of what we're going to say and announce at Connections, we've been working hard for the last year. So be in the lookout for a lot of exciting announcements, particularly around new and significant BroadCloud based applications. These announcements will highlight our execution on driving continued product innovation, which is one of our four strategic objectives.
Also regarding product innovation, I wanted to announce that last week, we were positioned by Gartner as a visionary in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Contact Center as a Service report. Our solution is differentiated by its ability to provide detailed analytics that can be used to optimize the performance of the contact center. The Contact Center as a Service market is in the early stages of mainstream adoption, and we believe given our differentiation that we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. For example, we've just won a deal to be the contact center provider of an incumbent European telco operator.
I'd like to update you on a couple of other strategic objectives. First, we're adding new markets and channels and increasing the breadth of our solutions available to them. A couple of months ago at HITEC, one of the largest hospitality technology trade shows, we announced the launch of our BroadCloud hospitality solution. It's a turnkey product that provides voice and UC capabilities for both staff and guest rooms, as well as the middleware required to connect into the nerve center of a hotel, its property management system.
Our cloud solution provides a clear value proposition, lower cost and greater feature functionality as compared to current premise-based products. These attributes are both important as the phone systems in hotels are no longer the profit centers they once were, and as hotel properties look to improve their overall guest experience. With more than 150,000 hotels and 14.5 million rooms worldwide, and the vast majority of them still using legacy PBX solutions, we see this as an excellent opportunity to grow our BroadCloud business. We're delighted to have partnered with Windstream for the U.S. launch of our BroadCloud hospitality solution.
On expanding our BroadCloud footprint, I wanted to highlight our first meaningful cloud win at a government vertical. As you may recall, we previously noted the Federal Government is the larger opportunity for our solutions given that they has several million total seats and a significant percentage of them are still on legacy TDM-centric services. It's a focus area for us to convert these seats over to BroadCloud based communication solutions. Our first win, which was a service provider partner for a government entity, and the award was for over 5,000 seats.
Also regarding our BroadCloud footprint, we announced the acquisition of VoIP Logic earlier today. VoIP Logic is a wholesale provider of BroadWorks-based cloud communication services to ISPs and other service providers in the U.S. We have been successful in growing our customer base by offering an attractive cloud wholesale offer to their customers.
This cloud model will be added to our BroadCloud portfolio, and addresses the needs of service providers who want greater control of the platform and to maintain their own back-office systems. As such, we think VoIP Logic represents a great complementary piece of our SaaS portfolio.
I want to personally welcome aboard, the entire VoIP Logic team, including Micah Singer, their Founder and CEO.
With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report our Q3 2016 results and note that this marks our ninth consecutive quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth.
Total revenue in the third quarter was $84 million, up 22% from the year-ago period and total billings were $79 million, up 11%. Q3 EPS of $0.52 represented 41% year-over-year growth, and was driven by revenue strength and lower than expected expenses.
To me, the headlines in the quarter beyond the strong overall revenue in earnings performance were, one, a very strong subscription and support and professional services revenue growth; two, the slowing growth in software, which I'll speak about in a moment; and three, of course, the very large software deal with an international customer that Mike mentioned.
Interestingly to note for Q3 and our year-to-date results, our recurring revenue line item, subscription and maintenance support, which includes our SaaS cloud business and our software maintenance, exceeded our software revenue. I think you can see how this â with this, how quickly we've moved our business to a recurring SaaS model.
Subscription and maintenance support revenue was $37 million, up 22% year-over-year. Of this amount, SaaS revenue was $12.7 million as compared to $9.2 million in last year's Q3 and $12.8 million last quarter.
Subscription and support billings were $34 million, up 35% year-over-year. Our SaaS performance was in line with our expectations and the guidance we provided in our August conference call.
Maintenance support billings was up significantly driven by strong renewals, as well as new maintenance signings. Our expectations for Q4 is SaaS revenue of over $14 million, which includes approximately $800,000 for our two-month contribution from the VoIP Logic acquisition, and a return to sequential organic growth.
I think we will exit 2016 with an implied SaaS run rate of about $60 million annually and an overall annual â I'm sorry, an implied faster revenue run rate of about $60 million and an overall annual subscription and support run rate of about $150 million.
Professional services and other revenue of $16 million was up 103% year-over-year, driven by hitting milestones on a number of transformation projects. Professional services and other billings were $20 million, up 41% year-over-year. This outsized performance for both revenue and billings is driven by the major transformation deals we've been discussing, several of which Mike mentioned.
While the number of transformation projects have had initial service launches, our professional services business is now and will continue to benefit from phase 2 and phase 3 parts of these projects, which aim to bring to the market, additional service offerings targeted at different end-market demographics. So we think this robust level of transformation and other services will continue.
Software revenue of $31 million was up slightly versus last year's Q3. Software billings were $24 million, down 22% compared to Q3 of last year. Some thoughts on software. One, we continue to believe that the software side of our business has solid growth prospects as we finish this year and move into 2017. Two, sell-through in our major regions and with our key customers is solid for the quarter and year-to-date. Three, the struggle with software growth is most acute in North America. We continue to see and expect solid growth in Europe and emerging markets.
As I noted and Mike highlighted, we actually had our largest aggregate software deal in the company's history this Q3 with an international customer, although the billings and revenue impact in the quarter was relatively modest relative to the overall value of the deal. We will see both revenue and billings from that deal over the next three years.
Four, regarding our software business, we have two drivers in software license sales, the first is new service launches from our carrier partner and the other is ongoing sell-through of seats for existing end-market service offerings. The latter is obviously the larger and more significant of the two. Our sell-through over the last several years has been solid. As you may recall, last year, we sold through about 3 million UC seats, growing our subscriber base to 13 million subs. That means we added more seats last year than most of our most our competitors have in their total installed base.
Now, in 2016, we are on pace to exceed that 3 million seat number, but to show meaningful growth in our software business, we need to see a bigger acceleration in that figure. Our expectations entering into 2017 is that our transformation projects will help jumpstart that subscriber add number. These transformation projects are with our largest customers that have the broadest reach in targeting end users, and they're backed up by marketing budgets and internal senior management focus.
Now, on to margins and expenses. In Q3, we had gross margin of 76%, which was a 200 basis point improvement versus the year-ago quarter. Software margin was 96%, up from 94% in the year-ago period. Subscription and support margin was 73%, flat with last year. Professional services margin was 46% as compared to negative 3% in the year-ago period. For Q4, we expect overall cost of sales to increase by up to $1 million.
Operating margin increased to 21% versus 17% a year ago. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $47 million. Our expectation for Q4 is that OpEx will increase by approximately $45 million from Q3 driven by end of year sales commission expenses, costs associated with our Connections trade show, and the VoIP Logic expenses and transaction cost.
Moving to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was a strong $15 million. Net cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $367 million at the end of September, up from $357 million at the end of the second quarter. Account receivables were $105 million at the end of September, essentially flat with the balance of $106 million at the end of June. Our deferred revenue balance at the end of Q3 was $102 million, down approximately $5 million sequentially.
Now on to guidance. As you may have seen in our earnings press release, we expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $94 million to $102 million, and EPS to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.83. For the year, our revenue guidance is now a range of $333 million to $341 million. We are increasing our previous full-year EPS range to $2.04 to $2.22. Keep in mind, our full-year guidance now reflects approximately $800,000 of estimated incremental revenue and has estimated any dilution related to the acquisition of VoIP Logic, as well as a $0.04 dilution from our Intellinote acquisition in Q2.
While we're currently in the middle of our budgeting cycle, I did want to finish up with some early thoughts about 2017. I think in terms of revenue in 2017, I expect overall growth to be in the mid-to-high teens from the midpoint of our guide. You should continue to see our pivot towards our SaaS and recurring maintenance revenue, those revenue streams could be in the $170 million to $180 range. We will also see growth in our professional services business, and I expect software to grow around high single digits to 10%, driven in part by deals such as the one I just described and orders from transformation projects.
Regarding profitability, I believe that our non-GAAP EBIT margins will continue to be in the 20% (19:39). I'll note that I'll provide some incremental color regarding our 2017 outlook at our Investor Day on December 5 in New York. In addition, Mike and Scott, our co-founders, and Taher Behbehani, our Chief Marketing Officer, will update you on our vision and new solutions, including providing you with a recap of our BroadSoft Connections content. We will also demo some products that I think will show how we're already delivering on the future of work with solutions that make it easy to collaborate and be productive. So, I think you'll find it a very interesting and informative session. You can register on the IR section of our website, and look forward to seeing you all in New York. With that, we'll open the call up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. Love to get a little more color on the license weakness. I think you called out North America as being the primary source of that, and it seems to be driving perhaps a somewhat tempered growth outlook for next year versus kind of a 20%-ish type of growth rate that we've been I thought looking for, for the sort of medium-term here. Just wonder if you could give any color on that, what's causing that North American license weakness and how you think that might change or not.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So â yeah, correct. I think it's a few things. One is in some ways, it's an indication of where we're moving the business more and more to a SaaS model, which I think is really long-term positive. Two, it is more in North America. North America is also where the preponderance of our network transformation deals have been, and taken obviously lots and lots of focus and effort. And I think the overall growth in North America has been fine. It's the mix with software that's been a little bit of a struggle.
And I think with those â I mean it's pretty exceptional to think about the number of those U.S. based network transformation projects that just hit the market in the last quarter, Rogers, AT&T and Verizon, all I think exceptional projects, all very, very mobile driven. And so, I think it gives us a platform to get renewed growth on the software line, especially in North America next year. But, the reality is there's a bit of a constraint at the software side of our model, Rich, and I alluded to it in the prepared remarks, is if our carriers grow consistently, our software line tends to decelerate. We need acceleration in new platform adds on the software side of the business for us to really get software growth. And so, I think we're seeing that, to be honest, in North America, where we're getting very consistent, but not accelerated performance from our carrier customers.
With these big additions, our anticipation for next year is we'll return to that acceleration. We're not seeing the same thing outside of the U.S.; in both Europe and Asia, the rate of new implementation and the rate of sell-through acceleration has actually been quite robust, and we continue to see software growth there.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. And wanted to just jump to the launch of the Verizon VoLTE-based service. Certainly, a nice â as you said, to the proof point for your VoLTE-based service, I'm wondering if you can talk about sort of the broader implications of that and might that drive â are there other sort of VoLTE type implementations in the pipeline that could follow that?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. Rich, this is Mike. I think what we're seeing is that, let me say generally, with mobile launches, the sell-through off the launch mark has been the strongest and most compelling to the end user. So we're starting to see more and more of the operators focus and target their development or their additions to their service launches around mobility. So as I said in the remarks, deploying as a VoLTE is one way, there are other ways of us integrating very closely to the mobile network. I think all of those different mechanisms have been very tightly integrated to the mobile network are interesting. I think as companies launch in markets, I think that it will create competitive pressure on other operators to follow suit, given the success of those markets. So we're pretty excited by â we're seeing some in Europe, we're seeing a number in North America, we expect that to push the other operators in each of those markets to follow and to create competitive solutions based on mobility.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for that. And one final one for me, Jim. I missed what you said about professional services growth at 2017, if you could just refresh us on that.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah, so I wasn't specific, but I suggested that we continue to think that we get continued growth on the professional services line. So, I think my expectation is that the â SaaS continues to drive growth in the business. I actually think next year is going to be a really pretty attractive SaaS year for us.
And so that subscription and support line item will again be kind of the headline. I think professional services with the transformation project and the follow-on project will continue to grow forth, and I think software will be solid but not spectacular in the high-teens to 10% range.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
I'm sorry, high single-digit to 10% range.
Richard Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Yeah, that's great. Okay, thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I was curious back to the software license billings. I think you said, Jim, that the business is headed to more of a SaaS model. I guess I was wondering if there is any way to deconstruct the BroadCloud revenue that you're generating, and give us a sense for what software billings growth might look like in the case where all that revenue came in the door as a BroadWorks license or software licenses.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Oh, yes.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
I'm just wondering, how much that's building (27:26) your growth rate is the question.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Oh, I actually â yeah. I think that's pretty speculative, George, I think there is clearly â I guess, where we're really going with this, and you'll see it more and more next year, is that even for our software customers, we're putting more and more of our new product and innovation in on a SaaS basis. So if you look at the â and certainly, things will be announced at Connections. As Mike said, I don't want to front run the announcements. But if you look at what we're doing from a future work collaboration kind of standpoint, you look at our contact center as two quick examples, those capabilities will all be delivered only as cloud, but importantly, they are cloud to both our software and BroadCloud customers. So I think the kind of the point of emphasis is software has slowed, especially in North America, as the unit growth has kept going, but not accelerated, I mean, I think that's just a standalone fact. And we think that, that unit number will accelerate again next year with the impact of these network transformation projects. Two is we are moving more and more of the business to SaaS, and that's really two-pronged. It's not just new BroadCloud implementation, but it's layering on more and more capability on a SaaS basis going after this now 15 million plus base of BroadSoft hosted customers, or BroadWorks hosted customers. And I think, again, if I look to next year, you're really going â my expectation is you'll really see that pivot to SaaS come through in our results in 2017 and beyond.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And then the related question here, I guess I was wondering if some of the year-on-year comparison is driven by lumpiness in the year ago quarter or even lumpiness in the 2015 full year number. As I think about software billings, is there anything that's worth pointing to there that makes the comparison funny?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. I mean â so there is â I mean I think there were a few deals last year that upsized that â were essentially booked as all software. This year, part of this is a little bit of goofy accounting for multi-year deals like the large one we just announced. One, we only â it's billings over several years, actually increasing billings. So, we only build in Q3, a small part of the full deal. Two, the way that even the accounting works on billings is that you take â we end up taking lots of carve-outs, and so a lot of the impact, which was not that big in Q3, was actually in the subscription and support line as we had to do these 97 through carve-out. So â and the â I didn't really bring it up in the prepared remarks because I think the response can often can be, well, isn't that true every quarter and it just sort of evens out over time. And there is a â I mean, it's a reasonable argument, it's just â it was more impactful this quarter, and then some of the larger deals last year, we didn't have that same level of carve-out. So the total billings actually in some way is a bit more of an indicator than software billing just because of that, the nature of the different deals.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

And our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question, I think I have two of them. First on the large international deal you referenced in the prepared remarks, I think you said billings over the next three years â do you have a sense of timing of revenue rec on that deal? Will that be similar in terms of starting in 2017 and ramping for three years?
And then secondly, you kind of referenced sell-through growth rates a couple of times. I wonder if you can gives us an update on maybe bifurcating those between what you're seeing in North America versus what you're seeing in aggregate. Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So, yeah. So on the first one, the rev rec will generally follow the billing over the next three years. And so, it's a â it's definitely eight figures per year and growing each year. That's really software plus support plus a little bit of professional services. The impact in this quarter, as I said with George's question, was somewhat muted because of these carve-outs, and what happens is the carve-outs move to billings to other revenue line items, especially subscription and support, and then that becomes ratable revenue. That will be true across the three years, but I think it's the ins and outs, once we get through 2016, kind of balance. So, it all â I think the rev rec will not be too different once we hit 2017 between revenue and billings.
And then on the sell-through, the â we're â we continue to see the U.S. is kind of consistent, but not â I'd characterize it as consistent but not accelerating, and we're seeing more evidence of acceleration outside the U.S.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And any chance you can quantify that? Is that consistent in the U.S. at 25% or consistent in the U.S. at 10%? And then a follow-up, Jim, on your 2017 kind of preliminary look. Although you didn't give professional services exactly, if you kind of do the algebra, it looks like you're expecting another certainly double-digit, maybe 20% plus here in professional services to hit that revenue range. And so, I guess, what I'm wondering is how much of that is contingent on new network transformation deals versus what you have visibility for at this point? Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So, yeah. So, I think that the â on the sell-through in the U.S., I'd characterize it is as healthy, and so I think that's at least at market growth. So, really solid growth. We'll â I'll use this as more of an enticement to come to our Investor Day. And I can give you some more of that annual growth dynamics, but it's â we're not seeing a paucity of growth in the U.S., just how it translates into the software business.
And then, I'm sorry the second question was...
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just on...
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So it's a mix, and it's a mix of follow-on with the current network transformation deals, more designed, BroadSoft design work, and then some follow-on network transformation projects. But â most of which are known and forecasted, so there's not a lot of, from a forecast standpoint, just sort of to be found laters.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is open.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my question. One is, just in general, North America, last week, it was announced, CenturyLink and Level 3 merger. Even though we know, obviously, that it's more enterprise related, not a CapEx function, can you talk about that possible merger and maybe some of the overlap in the sales organization, like cause some â or may not â may or may not cause any implication on your sell-through model? So, that would be first, to give some color about consolidation in the United States and how that's affecting any of your sell-through.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. Catharine, it's Mike. I guess, I would say that we have lived through lots of consolidation in our customer base in the past. Typically, in the case of the rumor you mentioned â I've got enough, okay. Jim saw me kind of on the outside, I haven't read in the morning news â that they're both customers, I don't see any big change in our business with the two companies.
And typically, that's we've seen in North America, is that a BroadSoft customer merges with a BroadSoft customer, and generally, that means that we have a consolidation and a stronger business going forward. So, I don't see a big impact. There is obviously a little bit of reshuffling every time one of these happens with our sales organization, again, something that we become probably too good to act, it's not a lot of fun, but we can shuffle around pretty quickly and make sure that we have good coverage on the account as they merge.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. And the other question has to do with like, for example, a Verizon who has three different use cases, the consumer, the one you spoke about earlier today, Talk One, and the VCE initiative. Can you discuss if do you think that, because you have now three use cases in there, that means you'll triple the rev â well, double the revenue on the two, and obviously, no consumer is going away and what the expectation there is? I mean, seems to me that one is cannibalizing the other one's sales, but that's â I'm 20 feet removed from the whole situation and could you discuss that? Thank you.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. Well, let me discuss it in a more general way because I don't want to talk too much about Verizon's strategy with the â they were â try to provide some coverage for our customers. I think we generally see in most of our big accounts, Catharine, is that we have a number of very detailed segmentation breakouts and service offers, so some are very, very led by mobility, very small SMB-oriented. Some are targeted at kind of low end bundled with broadband, some are mid-market more sophisticated, some are large enterprise.
And so we're seeing the market become a little bit more mature and our operators getting better at segmentation, and we actually see a number of offers that will go to market. And then, obviously, we have verticals like the one I mentioned around fed or hospitality. And so I think that what we're going to see as we continue this business that in larger operators, we may have five or six lines of growth in different sales organization, one through channels, one direct, one online, and I think that's what we're going to see.
I don't see them typically building offers that are going to compete with each other. I think if there is anything â if that is the case, then we'll see our carrier basically saying, okay, we're going to migrate from solution A to solution B, and over time, basically put all of our eggs in another â in one of the new offers. So I think that's kind of the general trend we're seeing, not only in North America, but internationally with the bigger kind of multi â the operators that have â covering lots of segments.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks. Appreciate it, Mike.

Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Your line is open.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thank you very much. Sort of following up on previous questions really. So, guys, to hit your revenue guidance for the year, the license billings need to be about 20% as far as growth goes in Q4? That's my first question.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
I'm sorry, Dmitry, ask me that question again.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. In order for you to hit the revenue guidance for the year, do you think your license billings will grow about 20% for â in Q4?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Actually, the â again, we're in a â we don't specifically guide on billings, but the quick answer is, no, I actually don't need to get that kind of software billings growth to hit the guidance.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, because you have more of a turns business and less of deferred sort of getting recognized, is that what's going on?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Well, I think â and I think the trend that you've seen year-to-date from the network transformation projects will also continue in Q4.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. So the two deals that you had announced â the three rather, the Rogers, AT&T, Verizon you guys talked about that launched this quarter, when would be kind of the ramp or the inflection of the license billings or license contribution begin to really come in into the â into your model, into your revenue line? Would that â so it doesn't sound like it is Q4, so I'm just wondering, is it early 2017? I mean, how are you projecting, how are you assuming about what you've got to those three deals as far as revenue growth.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. So yeah, yeah, yeah. So the â so generally, with those deals, we did get some software order with the original deal. And so they're working off those earlier orders. Certainly, those orders were a small part of the software that we expect over time, and I certainly, from a longer-term standpoint, expect to get much more software, a multiple in software relative to the professional services work. We will see software billings from those offerings next year is my expectation, and then continued growth off of that base of software in 2018, 2019 and 2020. I mean, I think they really are quite significant, and that will continue to grow forth.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And then on the largest deal, if I may, maybe to Mike and you, Jim, as well as far as the revenue goes. For Mike, just kind of curious to see what â is there anything special about this deal as far as how it's being deployed, as far as one mobile or only mobile sort of one number service, or is there anything interesting going on with that, with regard to that deal in that international customers? Is that also BroadCloud or is that the BroadWorks deal, if you could just discuss in a little more detail, that would be really helpful. And then, Jim, on the BroadCloud for next year, SaaS, I don't know if I heard you say this or maybe I've missed it, but what do you think the BroadCloud SaaS revenue would look like next year as far as the growth or absolute, however you want to define it?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. Dmitry, I'll start, it's Mike. On the international deal, it's actually very similar to the answer I just provided to Catharine. I think where we started â this particular customer â first of all, it's all software, it's BroadWorks deployed. It's a long-standing customer of ours, and the deployment is across the various end-user segments from small to medium to large enterprise. It has been primarily a fixed offer adding mobility to it in over the next 12 months. It's part of the roadmap plan with that particular customer.
So we're a seeing a pretty broad brush of capabilities. There is also a small element of transformation in that particular project, which we didn't really highlight too much. There is some legacy infrastructure that will move over as part of that three-year plan that we have with that customer. So it's primarily new growth in all the segments, we're active in all the segments right now. As I said, we're going to be adding mobility, and there is also a plan to migrate and shut down a legacy network with some subscribers that are running on that legacy TDM infrastructure.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
And then, Dmitry, on SaaS, I think if you kind of reverse engineer our 2016, we land at around $51 million to $52 million for the year. As I mentioned, I think we exit at $60 million or a little more on a run rate basis. It was growth off of that. So my expectation on SaaS is it will be our fastest growing revenue line next year, and certainly, grow faster than kind of the overall â comfortably more than the overall growth that I suggested.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Jim, what are the key drivers next year for BroadCloud? Can you just refresh our memory? Is it DCE, BT, something else? Can you just give us a sense with Transera potentially? What are the key drivers there?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So it's actually, I think, pretty exciting. And it's a real mix of stuff. So, we've had â so first off, it's acceleration from our existing kind of the anchor tenants in the BroadCloud mall. We see kind of renewed acceleration, we see it with British Telecom, we see it with Verizon. And I think we're going into next year feeling very solid about the kind of core part of BroadCloud.
Two is, we've had some pretty major wins. I will talk a little bit more about those, hopefully we can at the Investor Day, that aren't in the number yet but will start being in the number next year. As Mike said, then you start layering on the kind of our add-on business, both contact center and a lot of the you see in collaboration product. And as Mike said, we just had a big win in Europe on contact center with one of our existing BroadSoft, BroadWorks customers, so that's, I think, a real proof point of that model.
And that pipeline looks good, and we're having more and more product on a SaaS basis that we can sell back into the software base. So, I think it all mixes into, I think, an opportunity to grow that revenue line quite nicely next year.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you very much. Keep up the good work, gentlemen.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.

Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
Thank you. Jim, Mike, how much revenue do you expect from contact center next year and how does that compare to this year?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So, we're run rating â we're up to a couple million dollars a quarter on contact center right now, and my expectation is that it will show nice positive growth next year.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
And federal government is obviously coming from zero, any thoughts for some range of revenue for next year?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So it's really early, Paul. As Mike said, we had a very nice BroadCloud win in the federal government. The wheels of commerce in our beloved government can be slow, but we have a turn of commercial activity. There are some certification steps that we're continuing to go through to be able to more broadly offer BroadCloud.
So I think you'll â we'll continue to see wins next year, but even that project that Mike talked about isn't really going to move the needle huge until â and not even â it's not going to move the needle huge and arguably, not really hit the revenue stream until late Q2 or Q3 by the time we run through implementation with that customer. So I think it'll help. It certainly helps bolster growth next year, but it's going to be in the mix, not glaringly obvious. But I think, especially because it's going to be all or almost all BroadCloud, it's â it really will be additive over the next several years.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
Okay. And on â I apologize, I know there are a lot of questions about the large deal you all announced, the largest in your history, but I don't think I heard you all put a dollar number on it, either in total or for next year. Any thoughts you could share with us? And then I will get to my real question.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So, yeah, what we said three-year deal, eight figures per year, and those eight figures grow each year.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
Okay. Now, let me get to my question. I'm a little confused. You've got growing contacts revenue, albeit coming from a small base, but you're expecting meaningful growth. You're expecting some â talking for next year. You're expecting some contribution from the federal government. You've got this new deal that's going to be $10 million plus per year. And perhaps I was under a mistaken impression, but I thought that BroadCloud had significantly better economics from a revenue generation standpoint than your traditional one-time license software model. And your BroadCloud revenue just took a big step up this quarter after having been somewhat disappointing from a growth perspective previously.
Unless I'm mistaken on the BroadCloud notion, when you put all that together, how is it that next â I'm just trying to understand the guide â your comment for next year, if I heard you correctly, talking about 15% type growth. With all that going on, with the better economics with BroadCloud, with the contribution of the contact center, with this new significant deal, unless you were factoring it previously, it sounds like it just came in, how does that work out to just 15% growth?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So, well, first off, we said, mid-to-high teens. So overall growth, I think that suggests higher than 15%. To the big â the very large deal is software, not cloud, Paul. And so, it's â that will hit in the software and...
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
Jim, I apologize for the interruption, but it doesn't matter where the â I mean, put aside the detail software recurring, it doesn't matter. It's $10 million plus of incremental revenue that wasn't there previously. What am I missing?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Well, but â so, first off, it's the â it's an existing customer. So, there was a run rate with that customer already. So, it does not â it's not purely additive. It's just â it's definitely a step-up with that customer. But our revenue line and certainly, at our software revenue line, you got to have broad-based growth, not just a single deal. I mean, it's all part of the mix. Third, contact center, yes, it absolutely will grow next year, but it's â is it enough to move the needle to really drive acceleration on our top line. I mean, maybe, but at this point looking at 2017, I think it's helpful to growth, but I don't think it drives acceleration to growth.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
Who's talking about acceleration? I'm just trying to understand the deceleration that you're talking about, which is pretty significant. Again, am I wrong about the BroadCloud economics, that it's meaningfully better than your one-time software business?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So, I mean, it's actually â it's absolutely a better per line capture in terms of revenue opportunity, but I'm not sure. So, I think last year when we forecasted 2016, we suggested growth in the high-teens. I think we're effectively suggesting the same kind of guided growth this year. I think it's a mix of BroadCloud growing more quickly and software growing less quickly from an expectation standpoint with PS kind of in the middle. I'm not sure the â I mean that's kind of our view as we stand here.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC
I'll take the rest offline. Thank you.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah.

Our next comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. A couple of quick ones here, but first, can you just comment on the trend you're seeing with respect to revenue per line or seat and to what extent you believe you have an opportunity to up-sell your customers to more fully featured stack, how you're thinking about that opportunity next year, and maybe what percentage of your base is buying a basic PBX extension versus a more fully featured UC line?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. It's Mike. Let me start off with the trends, and then Jim will give us the number. So, yeah, generally, a good question. I think what Jim was commenting before is, first of all, more of our new seat sales are on higher SKUs, i.e., full collaboration, not just PBX replacement, but also the collaboration elements.
We also see an opportunity with the products that we're â we will announce as â in the next couple of weeks, looking at how we're going to go back to those base customers and upgrade them with some new feature functionalities to new incremental. And I think that's going to lead into what I would call kind of hybrid scenarios, where we have software customers with cloud add-ons that will actually drive some incremental revenue, incremental cloud revenue for 2017. And so we are â generally, we're seeing the market move up from a pure PBX replacement to a broader collaboration suite purchasing cycle. And we clearly believe that having contact center product that meets kind of mid and large enterprise market requirements enables us to add that into the mix in addition to the unified communications capability. So all that means that as we continue to go on, we're going to farm the base of customers, we'll add some hybrid customers that are half, let's say, half software, half cloud, and we'll see a growing value-add into the cloud line.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think that was a pretty good summary, the â our price per line has remained pretty consistent over time for hosted. Now, arguably, we continue to add value to that line. The bulk of those lines continue to be PBX replacement lines historically, they â newer implementation, including the transformation deals Mike talked about and our BroadCloud customers are much more â is much more UC-enabled or UC-intensive. And what I think is probably interesting as we go into the next year is this hybrid model that Mike talked about, where instead of layering on UC from a software basis, we'll do more and more of that on a SaaS basis into that software base. And I think that's yet a further path of SaaS-izing our business.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Jim, can you talk about the ASP or revenue per line or seat differential that you see between a fully featured UC line versus a PBX extension, or maybe even a hybrid line? And given it does sound like there's an opportunity there, if line growth was consistent next year, how come you wouldn't see revenue growth be consistent or potentially even better? Is there a change in the competitive environment? Just wanted to kind of understand that.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So on a software basis, a full UC line is meaningfully higher than a, call it, PBX replacement line. And we are seeing more of that in the mix, although those customers tend to be the largest customers that do exert some â because of the expectational volume, it's a mix of volume versus price realization, but as a general statement, that definitely get better price realization with full UC. We're not really seeing market pricing pressure on a â from a downward standpoint in selling software into our carrier customers. I think we're pretty enviable competitive position there. Certainly, the price realization per line in the hybrid model is quite superior to the software model. In essence, I mean if you think about the â once we sold the software line, the revenue opportunity, while very profitable, is limited to really maintenance. And perhaps to upgrading the line on the software basis, but that's proven to be a relatively small part of our mix. But our opportunity to do that on a cloud basis, it's a meaningful revenue opportunity starting next year, and I think will be a bigger part as we go after, on a SaaS basis, to the $15 million line base. But I think we will talk much more â in much more detail on the Investor Day on how we see that working.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, Jim, just last one from me, but in the past...
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...you've talked about operating margin expansion in 2017. I just wanted to make sure that was still on the table and if 2015 profitability level, if that's kind of a reasonable range to be thinking about next year. Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah, so as I said in my prepared remarks, our goal for next year is to add that growth rate to have EBIT margins start with the two. I think with â if you know with our model, just a little bit of revenue outperformance will be a significantly positive impact on EBIT margin. So right now, kind of pre-guidance top line, mid high-teens and 20% operating is the goal, but with just a little bit more revenue performance, certainly, we'd be in the 20s%.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, not necessarily up year-over-year from a margin perspective?
James Albert Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
No. Again, I mean certainly up from where we guided a year ago, but the business has performed â also performed better this year than we had expected on a EBIT margin, but yeah, right now from a guide standpoint, correct.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
