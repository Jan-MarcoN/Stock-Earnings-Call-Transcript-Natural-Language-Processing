Maxim Webb
Thank you, Lisa. Let me start by saying itâs a privilege to address all of you today as CEO, having worked for PICO since 1996. Itâs an honor to have been appointed to serve in this capacity. Iâll begin todayâs prepared remarks with an overview of our assets and dispositions to date this year and John will cover the financial results for the quarter.
A most important and significant assets are our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vidler Water Company and 56.9% on subsidiary UCP Inc. Vidler Water resource assets are unique assets that are for the most part fully developed and will provide an essential resource for future economic growth in Arizona, Northern Nevada and to a lesser extent Southern Nevada and parts of New Mexico.
We continue to engage negotiate with a number of interested parties for our long term water storage credits in Arizona. Itâs become apparent how strategically these assets are due to the structural deficit on the Colorado River. We are also acutely aware that selling some of our storage credits to actual uses of the water is much more preferable than selling credits to non-users as that should result in our remaining water storage credits becoming even more valuable.
Substantial economic growth continues in Northern Nevada as evidenced by a number of major corporate relocation announcements to the region. Such growth should have a positive impact on the markets for our water resources in the Northern Nevada, as future residential and commercial development projects secure their assured water supplies. However, we are mindful that growth of this magnitude in a region the size of Reno creates many challenges for the city, county and state agencies charged with managing that process.
In addition, skilled labor constraints during this rapid growth phase will also have an impact on the pace of growth.
Moving on to UCP, the company released its third quarter results earlier this week and John will cover UCPâs financial highlights in his remarks.
Overall, we are very pleased to see that UCP is striving to improve its return on equity and assets as they manage their existing land bank and their land acquisitions. Although UCP did not go forward in the 200 million notes offering as pricing exceeded that threshold, they appeared to have several distinct strategies including using internal cash generated from operations and various shorter term credit facilities to repay their senior notes due in October 2017. These strategies are detailed in the third quarter filings and earnings call.
In light of these factors, the PICO board is commenced the process for assessing all of its options with the respect to the companyâs investment in UCP. Today in 2016, we have also monetize some sundry assets which consisted of certain real estates in California that is not part of UCPâs operations and the majority of our oil and gas interest located in Colorado, the total gross proceeds of 15.2 million.
We plan to complete the post-closing items from the sale of these oil and gas assets and sell our remaining oil and gas assets as quickly as possible. This will allow us to wind down our oil and gas operations over the course of the next few months.
The remainder of PICOâs small and non-core assets now primarily consist of certain investments in private companies, mainly Synthonics and Mindjet. We are determining the best way to exit these investments in this timely manner as possible given the liquid nature these investments.
As noted in our press release stated October 12, the company wishes to accelerate the declassification of the Board of Directors as soon as we can contractually move forward, so that all directors are nominated for election of the 2017 Annual Meeting to serve one year terms.
Most importantly, I want to explicitly state that myself, John and the Board are committed to the current business plan of monetizing our assets and returning the proceeds to shareholders to stock buybacks or other means.
We aim to do this as efficiently and effectively as possible given the particular circumstances of the markets for the assets we own and our working capital requirements. We continue to reduce our cash burn and thus our future working capital needs.
That wraps up my brief remarks, and now I will turn the call over to John, who will cover our third quarter financial results.
John Perri
Thank you, Max, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Starting with our cash position, as of September 30, 2016, we have unrestricted cash and securities of $9.7 million. As Max noted in his remarks, during October, we closed on a sale of a majority of our oil and gas assets which realized immediate cash of $9.2 million and transferred certain related liability for the buyer. We also sold vacant lands in Fresno, California for $3.4 million.
In January 2017, we expect to receive nearly $6 million currently held in escrow, related to the sale of our canola oil operations last year. In the foreseeable future, we also expect to receive cash payments from UCP for minimum tax distributions as it continues to produce taxable income. Such income is sheltered by our net operating losses.
In summary, at September 30, 2016, we estimate our total cash from all sources for the next 12 months to be approximately $32.2 million. We project that our current burn rate for our cash outlays for overhead and existing water project cost excluding UCPâs operations and the severance payable for John Hart next year will be approximately $10.3 million per year. This provides us with the necessary working capital for at least the next 12 months including the severance payments to John Hart.
As such, we will have the ability to utilize a significant portion of proceeds from future asset sales or other transactions to purchase shares or return capital to shareholders through other means.
For the third quarter of 2016, our revenues were $96.7 million, an increase of $18.6 million from the same period last year, primarily due to increased revenue from UCP.
Total cost and expenses increased approximately $22 million to $99 million, due primarily to increase in cost of sales. The remaining cost and expenses remained fairly consistent period-over-period with a slight decline in G&A. However, we did record $4.6 million in impairment losses during the quarter, primarily related to the write-off of goodwill and UCP that was recorded in the Citizensâ transaction in 2014.
We continue record a full valuation allowance on our net differed tax assets, and as a result, recorded minimal income taxes during the quarter. The resulting loss per share from our continuing operations was $0.13 for the third quarter ended compared to $0.11 for the same period last year.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, shareholders equity declined $1million or $0.06 per share to $335 million or $14.52 per share. This decline was due primarily to our reported net loss of $2.9 million, offset by an increase in other comprehensive income.
Our water resource and water storage operations did not record any significant revenues during the three months ended, which contributed to the segments quarterly loss before taxes of $1million compared to income of $834,000 in the prior year quarter.
Our real estate segment report a net income before taxes of $2.8 million in the third quarter, down when compared to the net income of $3.8 million in the prior period. UCP increased its own building revenue by 28% to $89.8 million versus $70.3 million in 2015 and maintained GAAP margins on home sales quarter-over-quarter.
G&A expenses were down although include a onetime benefit from a $2.3 million reduction in contingent consideration also related to the Citizens transaction.
Our corporate segment reported a loss before tax of $4.1 million for the quarter compared to $3.6 million in the prior period.
General and administrative expenses decrease during the current quarter, primarily due to reductions in staffing and executive compensation offset by legal expenses related shareholder matters.
As a result of John Hartâs terminations, we expect to record $10.4 million severance expense during the fourth quarter of 2016.
With that, we will open the call to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Sorensen of U.S. Trust. Please go ahead.
David Sorensen
Hello, gentlemen. So Iâm hearing the comments for John Hart, did you say the $10 million severance package and why was that?
Raymond Marino
This is Ray Marino speaking. Good morning, David. Thank you for attending our call. John Hartâs employment agreement provided for a payment of $6.2 million as he had resigned and there was an additional $5 million payment due if he was terminated. The board determined that it was in the shareholdersâ best interest to terminate him. So the total payout will be about $11.2 million, which will be paid six months in a day after his termination, so sometime in April 2017. The reason that the higher payment took place after considerable deliberations, it was not found that we could meet the threshold terminations cause. The employment agreement approved by the previous board left the thresholds for cost at welfare and resulting a material damage to the company.
So any acts by John Hart, we could not at this time made that to termination. So that was with the outcome was from a pure economic standpoint John Hartâs employment agreement provided that he could, the next several years of salary and bonuses, then elected and resign, he would have received a significant payout. So it wasnât a very good decision for us to take and might have the fact that we had a very strong bench step in was thatâs why very [Technical difficulty].
And so we felt it was right time, we were obviously given additional support to the him, just because we do not have that prior to that time and wouldnât have been in the shareholdersâ best interests are good corporate governance for us to incur that kind of a liability without means to pay for it. So that sort of quick synopsis after many, many months of embarking upon evaluating the assets, the management team and the strategy, the board came to the conclusion was time for a change.
David Sorensen
Okay, thank you.
Raymond Marino
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Shapiro of Lawndale. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shapiro
Hi, thank you. Follow-up just on your comments Ray, and then I have a few questions on the water rights and such. Does the terminations of John that the termination that heâll be paid six months in a day, and all that means that any investigation and the termination of cause is now a complete and closed book or is there post John Hart in the boardroom and in the company investigation possibilities?
Raymond Marino
Well, the best way for me to answer that is, we've responded historically and a diligent and prompt manner from our standpoint to any allegations of wrongdoing. Thus far we have found no wrongdoing that would lead to a basis for cause. As always since the employment agreement that John and the previous board entered into, it provided for no releases either by John or by the company based upon either resignation or termination. There is a completely open door to any potential investigation should facts come into our attention that would more and justify the cost of pursuing that investigation. So itâs a long way of answering your question, but thatâsâ¦
Andrew Shapiro
Okay, so itâs not a closed book, but it's not highest priority that something comes up. Is a - and then going on to that next step on the same issue here, what is PICOâs agreement in place for board representation at UCP and what is the plan and timing to remove Mr. Hart from the UCP Board and who amongst your board or representatives at PICO might be his replacement?
Raymond Marino
Okay, so as everyone knows an 8-K was filed this morning, John elected to resign from the PICO Board. His agreement did not provide for him resigning from either board, if he was terminated from the company. And but I guess with the proxy solicitations starting on Monday, John elected to resign rather than go through the public filing of the consent solicitation.
With regard to UCP, their charter is different than PICO and it does not provide UCP the avenue to do a consent solicitation to remove a director. Accordingly, the options available to UCP is to one, wait for the next Annual Meeting, which John is slated for reelection and has a nominee of PICO, PICO has already delivered a letter to UCP stating and this letter was delivered on October 12, I believe, stating that John Hart is no longer PICOâs representative on the UCP Board. So we went on further to say that he would not be our nominee at the next Annual Meeting.
We also suggested to the UCP Board that the board consider increasing the size of their board and that matters under consideration and there's actually a UCP Board meeting tomorrow and that item has been put on their agenda based on what I've been told. I am planning to attend that meeting and have - I have attended all meetings since I became a board member and Chairman of PICO. And theyâve heard our request, theyâve read our request in writing, and we're going to liberate that tomorrow. As previously stated in our filings, I will be appointed to the UCP Board to represent be one of the two representatives of PICO, the other being Max Webb.
Andrew Shapiro
Perfect. Okay. Moving on to some water. What's the status of development in their milestones in the North Valley area of Reno towards triggering developer bits for some of PICOs Fish Springs water, in particular, it was mentioned on past calls and maybe some things jumped in front of it, but the thought was the first development was a project whose approval was expected by year end, but was moved back into 2017, because of a move by the parties that be to increase the density and scope of that project, is that still the first one in the line of projects, and what's the timing like for when they're going to be seeking approval for which they got to have water rights beforehand?
Maxim Webb
Good morning, Andy. This is Max. We believe that still to be the case that the development has been pushed back as you pointed out for looking at new densities. I think the timetable that has been outlined previously still holds good as far as we are aware. We would update shareholders and if there was any changes to that timetable.
Raymond Marino
Yeah, for the water assets, the most frangible assets and the ones with the higher probability of being sold Andy, is the water credits in Arizona.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay and timing or the status of that is what kind of color can you add you that? And maybe in your 10-Q, but it wasn't in this press release?
Raymond Marino
No, as I had noted in our prepared remarks, we are in discussions with a number of parties as folks realized that these are very strategic assets and continue to work towards closing a transaction or transactions with those parties.
Andrew Shapiro
Great. Last question Iâll back out into the queue, regarding those Arizona rights. What is the latest status on the Lake Mead surface elevation and the key elevation thresholds which I'm assuming would or could impact the value of those Arizona water rights you speak up the water credits?
Raymond Marino
Very much. I mean it's all tied in Andy to the structural deficit, I every use that term for the overall occasion of water and the river let alone with those cutbacks. So the credit as providing a means of water whether itâs to come back or just lack of resource currently in existence of become very valuable.
Andrew Shapiro
Right, but what's the latest and I thought the Lake Mead surface elevation and key elevation thresholds and potentially I guess a new lower base and drought contingency proposal. Those are all things that have been in flux and I don't know if there were any new developments if the Lake Mead levels had dropped sufficiently to trigger increase in value or not?
Raymond Marino
I'm pretty sure, but I would have to check this, but the Lake Mead cut back proposals have not been enacted as yet, they're still proposals.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. Thank you. Iâll back in to queue. But please come back to me.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we do have a follow-up question from Andrew Shapiro of Lawndale. Please go ahead.
Andrew Shapiro
Bit surprised to have it so quickly here. What's your current level of the company, the company's NOLs and how much was either utilized or added in the first three course of the year?
Maxim Webb
That's a good question Andy. In our 10-Q thatâs noted in our risk factors the level of NOLs has gone up for the quarter. At the top of my head, I don't have that number, but Iâm venturing to say itâs about $183 million of federal NOLs at this time.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay.
Maxim Webb
And that's a gross number, and thatâs not tax affected.
Andrew Shapiro
All right and the water rights and credits in New Mexico, Colorado or any other state, are there been any status changes to discuss in the development or value enhancement of those rights are credits in those two or additional states?
Maxim Webb
In Colorado, we are not applying for any new water rights. We have existing water rights there, which we lease and are looking to sell. In New Mexico as detailed in our quarterly filings, we are in the process of appealing water rights that we would denied in the Middle Rio Grande. And so no real update there at this time.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And I think we talked about the Northern Nevada, but in the Reno area, but any developments in call it I guess is the Carson City Corridor where you have separate pool of rights as well as the Las Vegas area?
Maxim Webb
That's right Andy, the board directs that we own in the Carson line area that would serve Dayton corridor. Those we believe will be driven by additional demand once the new road that links I think it's interstate 50 to or state road 50 to interstate 80, once that road is connected at the end of 2017, I believe is the timetable that that would mean a residential areas in the Dayton corridor would be able to commute very easily to the trick the time of Reno industrial center much more quickly and be that source of our water rights would provide for some of that residential development in that area.
Andrew Shapiro
And the rights near Vegas, I think it was a power plant potentiality as well?
Raymond Marino
Yes, for the water rights that we own that we have already permitted. I would have a lot applications so we have in Lincoln County, the water rights there lend themselves very well to some sort of energy project, we have a committed site or nearly completed committed site, which the Vidler team continues to work on.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And so when it's nearly completed is our money is being put into that and it's moving forward?
Raymond Marino
We have put monies into that permit site with various other requirements needed, I don't have, but I don't know all the exact details of the top of my head, but there's very little funds going to it.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. And lastly, as UCP buys back shares, because they've announced a buyback,
Is PICO interested in participating in those purchases or at UCP is present somewhat depressed prices, is PICO interested more in increasing its ownership percentage?
Raymond Marino
Well actually neither happens Andy under the current structure of that buyback is occurring. Itâs UCP Inc. that is doing the buyback and so it's increasing the ownership of UCP Inc.âs remaining shareholders. PICOâs interest at this time are exchangeable units in UCP LLC. So our percentage ownership remains constant despite the buyback.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay and their buying back doesn't provide PICO any liquidity should needed.
Raymond Marino
Not at this time, no.
Andrew Shapiro
Okay. Thank you.
John Perri
Andy this is John Perri again, I just correct that record on the NOLs, in the press release, it stated at $140 million.
Andrew Shapiro
It was in the press release, okay. I missed it. Thank you.
John Perri
Yup.
Operator
And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Max Webb for any closing remarks.
Maxim Webb
Thank you. Well thank you everybody for listening to the call and Andy and David thank you for those questions. That concludes our remarks. We look forward to speaking with you all when we report our full year results in February 2017. And of course if there are any other follow-up questions, weâre always available to answer those to the best of our ability. Thank you all very much.
Operator
The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
