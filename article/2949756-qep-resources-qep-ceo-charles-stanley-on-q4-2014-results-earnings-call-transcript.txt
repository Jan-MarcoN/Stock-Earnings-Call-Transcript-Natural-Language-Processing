Greetings, and welcome to the QEP Resources Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.
William Kent
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources fourth quarter 2014 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you have not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results and the slide presentation with maps and other supporting materials.
In today's conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard. 
Richard Doleshek
Thank you Will and good morning everyone. I will quickly give some color about our financial results and guidance for 2015, then turn the call over to Chuck.
So, 2014 really was extraordinary year for QEP. We generated record EBITDA delivered record production and accomplished a number of important strategic objectives. I will get to a results in a second before I do I want to give you some background regarding the construct of our financial statements for the quarter. The sale of our midstream business resulted in classifying that business excluding the retained Haynesville Gathering System as discontinued operations, which means that in our income statements all the individual line items that were associated with the midstream business that were sold have been removed and the impact of those operations are reflected in the single line item labeled net income from discontinued operations net of income tax.
Additionally, in the income statement you will notice that some of the revenues and expenses between QEP Field Services and QEP Energy that were historically eliminated as a result of intercompany transaction are no longer eliminated. On the balance sheet you will see the assets and liabilities associated with midstream assets that were sold have been totally removed. Finally, we do not sell our Haynesville Gathering System and have improved the results of that assets in the QEP marketing and other. If you have questions we can discuss further in Q&A. 
Okay, turning to our results for the full year 2014, we generated $1.583 billion of adjusted-EBITDA of which $1.438 billion was generated from continuing operations and the $144 million was generated by discontinued operations. Our fourth quarter EBITDA from continuing operations was $366 million which compares to $371 million in the third quarter of the year and $320 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Factors driving our fourth quarter EBITDA include production which was a record 85.9 Bcfe or 6.7 Bcfe higher than the79.2 Bcfe we reported in the third quarter of the year. Total volumes were 5.2 million barrels up a 0.5 million barrels or 11% from third quarter levels and NGL volumes were 1.75 million barrels up a 188,000 barrels or 12% from the third quarter. Natural gas volumes were 44.5 Bcf, up 3% in the third quarter of the year and down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Haynesville volumes were down 26% from a year ago as a result of the natural declines and no QEP operated drilling activity in 2014. 
Crude oil comprised 36% of our total production in the fourth quarter compared to 24% a year ago. Our guidance for oil volumes for 2015 is 16.5 million barrels to 18.5 million barrels, a couple of percent up from 2014 at the midpoint of the range. Our guidance for NGL volumes for 2015 is 4 million barrels to 4.5 million barrels the midpoint of which is down 37% from 2014 driven largely by the assumption there will be ethane rejection all year. 
Our guidance for natural gas for 2015 is a 155 Bcf to 175 Bcf a decline of approximately 8% at the midpoint of the range primarily due to the sale of gas weighted Midcontinent properties in 2014 and continued decline in NGL. Chuck will give more color about the driver of our production guidance for 2015 in a few moments. 
QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price which includes the settlement of our commodity derivatives averaged $7.12 for Mcfe which was $0.57 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the third quarter and $0.22 per Mcfe higher than we realized in the fourth quarter of 2013. The equivalent price reflects field-level natural gas prices that were $3.78 for $0.32 per Mcf lower, field-level NGL prices that were 21.15 a barrel or $7.53 lower and field-level crude oil prices that were [$63.21] or $21 a barrel lower than the respective levels in the third quarter of the year. Field-level crude oil revenues accounted for 61% of total field-level revenue which was 3% lower than the third quarter of the year but up from 55% in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $142 million in the quarter, up from a $136 million in the third quarter of the year, and up from a $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. 
On a per-unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.74 per Mcfe which is down $0.03 per Mcfe from the third quarter. And transportation expense was $0.93 per Mcfe which was down $0.02 from third quarter. Our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses for 2015 is a $1.70 to $1.85 per Mcfe for the full year. 
G&A expenses were up $8 million from the third quarter, primarily as a result of higher expenses associated with the annual employee incentive plan. For the year G&A was $204 million up $44 million from 2013 as a result of higher employee compensation expense and expenses for outside professional services associated with the successful implementation or new enterprise resource planning system. Our guidance for G&A expense is a $165 million to a $185 million for full year 2015. 
In 2014, we generated approximately $3.3 billion of proceeds from various asset sales of which $2.5 billion was related to the sale of our Midstream business and remaining 800 million from the sale of our non-core E&P properties. Reported gain on the Midstream sales about $1.8 billion and a loss of about 149 million on the sale of the upstream properties. We also reported impairments of two proven and unproven properties of $1.1 billion primarily associated with our Haynesville and Permian Basin properties due to lower for commodity prices. These two non-cash items significantly impacted our reported net income resulting in $784 million of net income attributable to QEP or a $410 million loss from continuing operations for the full year. 
Capital expenditures on an accrual basis for E&P completion activities $1.71 billion. Additionally, we also reported 960.5 million all through acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we are forecasting the midpoint for 2015 capital spend to be $975 million which is about 42% decrease in our capital expenditures from 2014. 
Yearly proven reserves for 3.9 Tcfe down slightly from 2013. Acquisitions added 361 Bcfe, divestitures were 473 Bcfe and expansions and discoveries added 294 Bcfe replacing about 91% of production. 56% of the crude reserve for developed 59% of the crude reserve for natural gas. The [FECPV-10] of the crude reserves was $5.34 billion and the pretax PV-10 of the reserves was $7.5 billion the highest value in companyâs history. 
With regard to our balance sheet. At the end of the year, total assets were $9.3 billion and shareholder equity was about $4.1 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.2 billion all of which was our senior notes and we had $1.16 billion of cash in the bank. In conjunction with the sale of our Midstream business, we were repaid our $600 million term loan and repaid all the borrowings outstanding under our revolver. We also omitted our revolving credit facility by extending the maturity to December of 2019 and increased the commitments to $1.8 billion. I will now turn the call over to Chuck. 
Chuck Stanley
Thanks Richard and good morning everyone. So as Richard has already discussed our 2014 operational and financial results I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of our key accomplishments for 2014, share with your our broad response for the current commodity price environment and then quickly review each quarter to share some recent operational highlights and our 2015 operating plans before we move on to Q&A.
2014 was clearly a transformational year for QEP on a number of fronts. First, we continued our transition for a more balanced portfolio of crude oil and natural gas assets, and our operational results show that we are making great progress executing on that initiative. We produced the record 17.1 million barrels of crude oil in 2014 up nearly 17% from a year-ago marking our third consecutive year of greater than 60% crude oil production growth. Oil production now represents almost one-third of our field level production up from 20% in 2013. Second, we completed the sale of our midstream business for $2.5 billion in cash. That transaction not only simplified our story but also left us with a very strong financial position. Third, we hydrated our upstream portfolio through a combination of our Permian Basin acquisition in early 2014 and a divestiture of nearly $800 million worth of non-core E&P assets primarily in the midcontinent region. 
Finally, 2014 was an extremely profitable year for QEP as we delivered record annual adjusted-EBITDA of $1.58 billion. We exited the year with strong operational momentum driven by some very encouraging results from new completion designs in several of our key place a very strong balance sheet and access to plenty of liquidity. I couldnât be more pleased with these accomplishments which were in large part due to the hard work of our dedicated employees. 
So how was QEP responding to the very different challenging commodity price environment of 2015? First, while we have a strong balance sheet, we donât think itâs prudent to consumer liquidity to drive production growth at current commodity prices. We are focused on leaving within our means, while commodity price volatility and uncertainty around potential, and uncertainty around potential low cost savings and other savings in our operations make doing so an exact science. We will manage our capital program to stay as close as possible to cash flow. 
As you have seen from our 2015 guidance, we are dramatically reducing drilling and completion activity. We have already cut our operated drilling fleet from a higher 21 QEP operator rigs in the third quarter of last year to 12 rigs today and we are on our way to 10 rigs or fewer in the second quarter of this year. Second, we only drill wells that meet our internal rate of return criteria using current cost and forward strip prices, excluding the impact of our oil and gas price derivative portfolio. 
But we donât think it makes sense to aggressively consume the highest return assets in our portfolio simply for the sake of driving production growth while commodity prices are low and while costs are still coming down. We have already seen significant price responses from service providers and materials suppliers but we think there is more room for improvement. We believe slowing down drilling and completion activities to ensure that we capture maximum savings in the best interest of our shareholders. Third, we are not just focused on 2015 but also on 2016 and beyond. As you guys know a lot of our 2015 production performance is being driven by wells we drilled in the second half of 2014, so the full impact of the 40 plus percent cut in capital investment will not show up in this yearâs production results. We started decelerating our activity in the fourth quarter of last year to manage the draw and we will continue to work on the optimization of our well completions schedule to position ourselves to take advantage of the Contango in the forward price curve and to return to oil production growth when price is recovered and or when cost come down. 
Finally, while slowing down isnât a lot of fun for a drilling and completion teams it does afford us an opportunity to collect more well performance there for several important programs including our high density infield development project in the Williston Basin. And the recent enhanced well completion designs we are now planning across the number of our core areas. In some areas, we will continue to complete new wells so that we can collect and analyze this well performance to better position ourselves to accelerate development when prices recover and our cost come down. 
Now let me provide you some color on our recent operational results by area and details on our plans for 2013. As I do so, you can refer to the slide presentation which are company have released yesterday afternoon. In the Williston Basin, we currently have five operated rigs running for South Antelope and one on the Fort Berthold Reservation. Williston Basin net production average approximately 34,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the fourth quarter and 18% increase over the third quarter of 2014 and 95% improvement over the fourth quarter last year. The outperformance was driven by excellent results from wells completed with larger proppant volumes from less than forecasted down-time and from the concentration of activity on our high working interest South Antelope properties. We completed and turned to sales 15 gross-operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 83%, all on South Antelope. We also participated in 56 gross operated -- outside-operated Bakken Three Forks wells that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter. 
We continue to be extremely pleased by the strong performance of our South Antelope that were completed with larger proppant volumes. Recall we made the switch in mid-2014 from pumping about 3.3 million pounds to approximately 10 million pounds of proppant per well. The first large proppant volume were actually replaced over about 33 stages and more recently over an average of 50 stages. The earlier wells with large proppant volumes and average 33 stages, exhibited increases of over 30% in 90 day cumulative production volumes compared to comparable offset wells that weâre completing with 3.3 million pounds of sand in the same stage count. We completed approximately 20 wells in this family. In more recent wells, we have been pumping 10 million pounds of proppant over about 50 stages and these wells have performed even better with some exhibiting increases of over 60% in 90 day cumulative production compared to old 3.3 million down design. We think this new completion design should improve performance on our Fort Berthold over acreage as well. We recently completed several wells with the latest design i.e. the 10 million of pounds of profit in 50 stages but it's too early in the flow back history of these wells to draw meaningful conclusions. We also think new design the large profit volumes in the high stage count will be key to the successful infill well performance at both South Antelope and Fort Berthold. We believe this completion design results in a more complex pressure network that should in turn lead to a higher percentage recovery of the original oil at place in both the Three Forks and middle Bakken reservoirs. 
We continue to evaluate down-spacing on our South Antelope acreage and we expect initial production results from the latest family of high density infill wells in the second quarter. As a reminder, we are evaluating both 600 foot and 400 foot well spacing and we are also testing multiple benches of the Three Forks in this pilot. It will take at least 90 days of production history from the new wells to draw any meaningful conclusion, so stay tuned for results on this exciting infill pilot. 
We plan to invest about half of our reduced capital budget in the Williston Basin in 2015 and we plan to operate two to three horizontal rigs in this play. As a reminder as recently as November of last year, we had seven QEP operated horizontal rigs working in the Williston, so our 2015 capital budget reflects a more than 50% decrease in rig activity. 
Slides 6 through 8 provide details on our Williston Basin properties. Turning to the Permian Basin daily production during the fourth quarter averaged 9,700 barrels of oil equivalents a day. We completed and turned to sales 20 verticals and 6 horizontal wells during the fourth quarter. The 6 horizontal operated wells comprised of 4 Wolfcamp B, 1 Spraberry Shale and 1 Middle Spraberry well at an average maximum daily rate of a 1,025 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a maximum average 30-day production rate of 758 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
At the end of fourth quarter, we had 6 operated rigs in the Permian Basin: 2 drilling vertical Atokaberry wells and 4 drilling horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp D sections. As of today, we currently have 3 operated rigs running in the Permian, 1 drilling vertical wells and 2 drilling horizontal wells. We expect to drop the rig thatâs drilling vertical wells in the coming months and currently plan to run two QEP operated horizontal rigs for the remainder of 2015 in the Permian.
We are seeing some exciting early results from the Spraberry formation. Our first horizontal Spraberry Shale well located in Martin County was completed over a 6,590 foot lateral with 28 frac stages. The well had a peak 24 hour initial rate of 1,556 barrels of oil equivalent per day comprised about 84% oil and 30 day average rate of 9,995 barrels of oil equivalent per day comprised of about 80% oil. We have also seen some positive data points from several nearby Spraberry Shale wells that were reported recently by offset operators. We are very excited about our results and the offset operators results and we will continue to evaluate the Spraberry potential across our acreage position.
Like other operators we weren't immune to the severe weather and ice that impacted the [Midland] Basin in early January both our production and completion operations were impacted mostly during the first two weeks of the year, which will obviously have a negative impact on first quarter 2015 production volumes. Our Permian gas and NGL volumes have also been impacted by a chronic third-party gas processing plant outages that started with the storm and have continued until today. We expect that the processing plant problems will be sorted out by mid-March. We currently plan to invest about 21% of our capital budget in the Permian Basin in 2015 and slide 9 provides details of our Permian Basin properties.
Moving along the Pinedale with the end of the fourth quarter, we had four rigs operating on our acreage. We dropped one rig in early January and expect to maintain three drilling rig program at Pinedale for the remainder of 2015. In the fourth quarter, drill times from spud-to-total-depth averaged a record 10.7 days compared to an average of 12 days in 2013. We completed and turned to sales 21 gross Pinedale wells during the fourth quarter, including 6 wells for which QEP is the operator, but owns only a small overriding royalty interest.
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 45 gross Pinedale wells with QEP working interest that were drilled, cased and waiting on completion. During the fourth quarter, Pinedale net production averaged 285 million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day, and we recovered ethane from Pinedale production throughout 2014. But as Rich has already mentioned, given the current price environment our guidance anticipates ethane rejection for all of 2015 which by the way results in about a 7% or 8% reduction in natural gas equivalent volumes compared to that same volume with ethane recovery. 
On the theme of new completion designs, we have seen some very encouraging results from a new Pinedale completion design that we tested on 16 wells late last year. The new design has resulted in an average of 1.5 million cubic feet per of gas per day increased in initial production rates and an over 40% increase in 60 day cumulative production volumes compared to our old design. And the good news is that the new design doesnât cost us any more than the older. We are sufficiently encouraged by this early production response and employed that new design on all wells the we complete going forward. We will keep you posted on long-term performance. We completed 116 gross wells during 2014 at Pinedale, including approximately 10 wells of which we are the designated operator, but only on a small overriding interest. 
We current planned to invest about 19% of our capital budget in Pinedale this year and you can see Slides 10 and Slide 11 in the slide for more information on Pinedale.
Turning to the Uinta Basin net production averaged 81 million cubic feet of gas equivalent a day during the fourth quarter 28 million cubic feet of gas equivalent of which was from the Lower Mesaverde play. We recovered ethane from Uinta Basin during 2014, but like Pinedale we anticipate Ethane rejection in our 2015 guidance. At the end of the fourth quarter we had one operated drilling working in the Lower Mesaverde play which was drilling our six Lower Mesaverde horizontal well, and we continue to make good progress on reducing drill times and we are also experimenting with a refinement in our completion design on our horizontal wells and we should have results to talk about next quarter on our latest well. 
We expect to operate one rig during a portion of 2015 in the Uinta Basin and the play will attract about 3% of our total capital budget this year. Slide 12 provides details on our Uinta Basin Lower Mesaverde properties. 
Finally turning quickly to Haynesville, while we donât currently have any operated rigs running in the play nor do we anticipate running any operated rigs in 2015. We are still seeing a few outside operated well proposals that we expect to generate good returns even in todayâs commodity price environment. We continually like to participate in some of the higher return outside operated wells which we expect to result of spending about 4% of 2015 capital budget in the Haynesville. 
I am really proud of our accomplishments in 2014, we continue to deliver outstanding operational and financial results. We ended the year with a rock solid balance sheet which was obviously help significantly by our timely sale of QEP Field Services, which allow us to pay all of our short-term debt. We currently have an undrawn our revolver $1.8 billion and we have a significant cash position. We continue to improve the competitiveness of existing assets by enhance completion designs and by our focus on driving down cost. We are also aggressively pursuing opportunities to boost the inventory debt on our existing asset base through programs like our high density infield development in the Williston the delineation of the Spraberry potential in the Permian and the application of new completion designs in other parts of our portfolio like Pinedale and Uinta. 
We also have a substantial portion of our 2015 crude oil and natural gas production edge that prices well above the current spot price. But even with all these proverbial [indiscernible], we believe ranging in capital investment, slowing growth and preserving liquidity will allow QEP to successfully navigate through the current commodity price cycle and emerge on the other side well positioned for the future. 
In no uncertain terms, we are slamming on the bricks hard but let me also be clear that we are doing this from a position to strength. Our high quality assets are not going away and we believe that imprudent to aggressively drilled through our best acreage in the current price environment, despite the more than acceptable returns that these assets generates and todayâs forward oil and gas prices. 
We were diligently a transferring from QEP into one an E&P company with a more focused and balanced portfolio with higher return investment opportunities are capable of delivering superior returns on a variety of market conditions. We have been through a number of these cycles in the past and we are confident that we have the right assets, the right capital structure and the right talent to not only withstand the current market conditions but to most certainly prevail. 
With that Natalia, we can open the line for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Tim Rezvan with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. 
Tim Rezvan 
Hi good morning folks, thank you for taking my call. I guess first question I had on your 2015 oil guidance. It looks like there is some modest growth year-over-year, you are shortly down from 4Q levels. I know you spoke about managing the backlog of wells waiting completion. How should we think about the trends based on the forecast you have given?
Chuck Stanley
Good morning Tim. I think the best way to think about it as I said in my remarks we are slamming on the bricks hard and now that there is a slight uptake in the backlog of wells waiting on completion. I would expect that first quarter to be step change down from the fourth quarter in response to the dramatic decline in oil prices and then a flattish year after that for production. So don't think of it as a ramp down or over the year we're going to try to manage our completion backlog and manage the production volume downward quickly in response to lower prices and then push out the completions to flatten the year if not backward load the year depending on what happens in the oil price markets. 
Tim Rezvan
And then you gave some very encouraging data points on your high profit I guess productivity from the wells, you said you had 90 plus days of performance from about 20 wells what do you think on the EUR uplift from I guess the 1 million barrel type range you have talked about in South Antelope?
Chuck Stanley
Well it's a multi variable equation Tim because we will be in-selling now so we would expect some deterioration in the infill wells just in the EURs and what we're thinking and what we're seeing is that perhaps a lot of that is going to be offset by the large profit volume, well performance that we're seeing but it's too early to tell in the infill pilot program obviously what the EURs will be for the new wells we're drilling. What I will tell you is that on a same-store basis so if we have a well -- a set of wells isolated that are not seeing any interference from infill we would expect to see a 20% or 30% improvement in the EURs and again that's early days and might not be that good because obviously we're just seeing cumulative production data for the early lives of these wells. The first 20 wells that I mentioned that have the large proppant large 10 million pound proppant volumes 33-34 stage average completions, some of those wells have been online for 6 months now the performance is clearly [heading] ahead above the older family of 3 million to 3.5 million pound proppant volumes. Where it ends up on EUR we start to feel pretty good after a 120 days or 180 days of production that that increase is meaningful and sustainable but we need really more production history to be 100% confident. 
The newer set of wells and it's a much smaller samples that we have [reported in] about five, six, seven wells now Jim that have the higher stage count the 50 stage count, those wells have a remarkably higher 90 day performance and we're continuing to watch those wells the performance is very impressive better than 50% some even better than 60% cumulative production -- 90 day cumulative production improvement over the older offset wells. And that frankly is one of the things that drove our production outperformance in the fourth quarter. We didn't forecast that kind of outperformance and we have been extremely pleased and in fact surprised that how good the high stage count wells are working. So stay tuned very exciting and as I mentioned in my comments we're trying other tweaks and completion designs in other parts of our portfolio we're doing it in the Permian we're doing it at Pinedale and we're also doing it in the Uinta and we're seeing positive responses across the portfolio.
Tim Rezvan
I just have one more quick one and then I will step off. Another operator in the Pinedale is talking about well cost coming down to the $3.4 million, $3.5 million level, do you think that's possibly in the cards this year?
Chuck Stanley
Jim?
Jim Torgerson
Yes we were at 3.9 last year and we're thinking 3.5, 3.6 somewhere in that range for next year. 
Chuck Stanley
For this year. 
Jim Torgerson
I mean for '15, yes. 
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Corales with Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question. 
Brian Corales
Back to the Bakken it sounds like the new completions are working well and production has been strong, what are the cost changes to those enhanced completions?
Chuck Stanley
So if we I will let Jim pipe in. If we look on a pre-price correction and pre-cost correction basis $1.3 million to $1.5 million of additional cost for the added space count and added profit volume with sliding sleeve a little more if you do plug and perf and you will recall I didn't have anything in my prepared remarks but if you will recall in the last quarterly update we talked about pumping some plug and perf jobs to do a head to head comparison and answer once and for all whether or not there is a dramatic difference between plug and perf completions and sliding sleeve completions in the same rock with the same sort of offset well density and the same profit volume, we have pumped some of those jobs over year-end and we will be watching those during this quarter and into the next quarter to see if we see any results. My guts tell me and some other things we've seen from other operators tell me that it's probably an 
Unnecessary added expense. So 1.3 million 1.5 million before any top savings we think we can -- and our average well cost of 10 million we think we can get it down into sort of 9.7 or 9.5 and I could say lower but then Jim would reach over and grab me because he sits right next to me. But we have -- as I said in my remarks a relentless focus on driving down cost. The drilling team has done an incredible job of driving down they have drilled to 21,000 feet. I think our latest wells Jim help me out the record of 12 days which is just absolutely amazing, obviously we are taking some of that efficiency gain and improvement that their ability to achieve on the drilling side, and we are applying some of that savings back to the completion side by increasing the size of the frac jobs in the number of stages. 
The economics of doing that generate returns of well over 100% even on the forward strip. So we think itâs the right thing to do and we think itâs going to be key to infilling the South Antelope and Fort Berthold acreage and thatâs obviously very important to our long-term inventory on those properties. 
Brian Corales
Thatâs helpful. And just one more, and switching to the Permian. I know itâs a recently acquired asset; can you maybe talk about where you are in that play? Is there certain leasehold requirements you have to have or you still evaluating or you kind of on pad drilling and we can see some kind of efficiencies going forward? 
Chuck Stanley
So I think we are in the early innings, we drilled the number of vertical wells, for two reasons one to hold the remaining deeper acreage basically the lower part of the Wolfcamp and into the Atoka that was what drove the vertical drilling activity. On the horizontal side we are continuing as I said to tweak and refine stage count profit volume lateral placement and we are just now in the early stages of the evaluating the horizontal potential with the Spraberry is all new for us. The results are obviously quite encouraging and we are very encouraged by the results have been reported by offset operators. 
In one interval, in the Spraberry we assigned no value in our acquisition. So there is a lot upside there, not only in value but also in reserves as we continue to evaluate. As far as efficiency we are in the early days, I would say to use the baseball comparison we are probably in the third/fourth inning of efficiency compared to where we are in the Williston Basin. And part of that is been we are evaluating completion designs we are still learning exactly where we want to land lateral. So itâs been a learning curve. 
On the production side we have also been coming up to learning curve on optimizing our official lift. We started when we first acquired the properties using gas lift we moved like most of the other operators in the areas to a combination of ESPs in the early days and then rock pumps later in the lives of the wells in some instance to handle fluid volume. So itâs an evolution as we learn more about the Permian and the way the rocks behave. I will tell you they behave completely differently than the rocks in the Williston even though the permeability of the rocks is very similar. The way that wells flow back the link to time to takes for first oil after you frac a well, the interference when you frac a well and frac into an offset well is producing 100% oil or large volume of oil and you see that well get knockback to nearly 100% water after you frac into it, and then you have to wait for a cleanup cycle that looks just like the initial cleanup cycle to get the well back to full volumes are all things we are learning about as we refine our understanding in the Permian.

Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with TPH. Please proceed with your question. 
Michael Rowe 
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dive in a little bit into the Bakken in terms of how you expect production look like from that asset in 2015? Is the switch to higher volume proppant design in addition to the down spacing test that you all are doing, impacting the amount of time it takes to bring wells online or potentially creating shut-ins that backend of your guidance? 
Chuck Stanley
It will obviously impact volumes from shut-ins. I think the biggest impact is that we are going from seven rigs last year which have spent 99% of their time drilling on South Antelope which is high working interest and obviously prolific to two rigs to three rigs this year. So just the number of wells that are being delivered that are capable being completed in terms of sales can drop off dramatically, and then we are deliberately slowing down. We just don't think it makes sense to drive production growth and to consume what in our mind are some of the best return highest value assets in the company in fact in the basin in this commodity price environment. So what you are seeing in our guidance is in part operationally induced but is also in part delivered in an attempt to [due to] the response to the current oil prices. And another just final point on that is we think that if we can slowdown that we can also more fully embed the cost savings that we're seeing coming in from our service providers as we allow basically the cost to move through the drilling and the completion operations going forward. 
Michael Rowe 
And I guess you mentioned that you were looking in 2015 at down-spacing and other initiatives to enhance your inventory depth in your core assets. And so I just wanted to ask this is kind of a general question but I guess how do you think about M&A in terms of capital allocation in 2015 you obviously have a strong balance sheet and liquidity, so how could M&A compete for capital versus your portfolio of drilling opportunities?
Chuck Stanley
We look at capital investments across the waterfront whether it be drilling holes in the ground or acquiring oil and gas assets either through asset acquisitions or through M&A. We are evaluating a number of opportunities and we will see how it plays out.

Our next question comes from Brian Velie with Capital One. Please proceed with your question. 
Brian Velie
A quick question on drilling in or I guess drilled uncompleted wells you give the numbers about gross wells coming out of 2014 I wonder if you could provide what you expect to have in do you see inventory exiting 2015?
Chuck Stanley
I don't have that number. We normally buildup -- Pinedale is an easy one -- we normally consume standing wells during the season and then we shutdown completion activity in the late fall when it gets cold depending on the year usually October, November time frame and then the inventory builds through the winter and I think we had 40 some wells at year-end, so that's [fairly] typical. In Williston the inventory has built as we have gone into the end of the year we had 35 wells waiting on completion at year-end, we had 20 at the end of the third quarter and 18 at the end of the second quarter of last year, so the inventory is building. What will that inventory look like if you can tell me what prices are going to do for the rest of the year I will tell you what our ending inventory is because in part it will depend on whether we see a recovery in oil prices in the second half of the year or whether we elect to continue to push out completions. But as I said in our prepared remarks we try to manage inventory and manage production volumes not only for '15 but into '16 as well anticipating that prices should recover and cost should continue to come down through the year.

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andrew Coleman with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. 
Andrew Coleman
The first one I had was just on I think about Bakken differential, can you elaborate any more on I guess I see the spread between rail and pipe kind of evolving through the year and what you think differentials will kind of average?
Chuck Stanley
I think one thing that drives the economics of rail versus pipe is obviously the Brent to TI basis differential. And early in the year we saw that differential grind the end to a buck and a half or so it is widened back out now it's what $7 or $8 I have got the price sheet here in front of somewhere but it's in that sort of $7 to $8 range and I suspect that it will continue to widen as we see the big three inventory builds continue to push down TI relative to Brent. Yesterday it was $7.57 for the range of [15] so obviously the economics of rail have been driven in large part by the ability of producers to load railcars and access Brent or other [non] LLS Brent or other non-cushion based pricing points. And those economics have improved some over the past month or so as we have seen the basis continue to widen as inventories is built in the U.S. I think that's going to continue. Greg or somebody can you tell what we have baked in for basis for the year for $11 which is not unreasonable I donât think given where we are. 
Andrew Coleman 
And as you guys go through your -- testing have a feel of how many wells you participated in with other operators over the past 12 months to 18 months. Is it a material amount and we getting started on?
Chuck Stanley
For increased density or?
Andrew Coleman
Yes. 
Chuck Stanley
We have been in a few pilots, I donât have a number at the top of my head but I will say that in addition to that is probably one of it not the best date as far as just been able to glean data from public information through drilling et cetera just from filings. And so we have a pretty robust data base on not only oil performance daily monthly production volumes but also pretty good detail on completion designs from operators in the Basin as well. So we have got a pretty good sense not only from our own work but from the work of others is that whatâs going on in these pilots and if I didnât say it in prepared remarks I should have that everything we seen today has been encouraging with respect to infield development both on our property and from the stuff that others are doing. 
Andrew Coleman
If I could just one more in here just one the cost savings that you all are seeing is it possible to tier based on like versus pipe versus completions versus drilling or where you are seeing rough cost savings across the Board, do you have that detail or should I follow-up with.
Chuck Stanley
We have good detail on that probably rather than trying to walk through on the phone and if you have specific questions Will can provide with it. I will tell you that the area that has generated the lease savings is been pipe, both chasing in and touring because like everybody else we order the stuff and buy at well in advance to put it in the ground and so it has been at least responsive to reductions in cost initially, although I suspect it overtime it will come down although steel prices in general havenât come down as much as itâs just the services side. Biggest savings because itâs one of the biggest components in completed well cost on a pressure pumping side and we are seeing significant response from a providers there and itâs all components of pressure pumping, fuel -- obviously fuel is down and fuel has an impact not only on running the pumps but also trucking which is moving proppant location et cetera. So thatâs why the biggest component, day rates are coming down, we are at a good place with relative to lot of folks and that we have very few long-term contracts on rig so the rig day rates are moving very quickly, we are not sticky as sticky some are, thatâs probably the third biggest component. But the big one is pressure pumping services and related supplies for completion. Thatâs where we are seeing instantaneous savings.

Our next question comes from Brian Gamble with Simmons & Company. Please proceed with your question. 
Brian Gamble 
Good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask about thoughts for the rest of the year on the drilling plans in regards to commodity prices versus cost savings. So when you look at current environment makes a lot of sense. Trucking activity for better days, does an improvement on the cost side Chuck as you excited about the back half as far as the return in various Basins and have those improved or do you need to see both the cost savings and a price increase on the commodity side to really get you to levels that believe makes sense. 
Chuck Stanley
This is tough one to answer Brian because itâs a there is Contango in the curve. So letâs assume that we continue to see that Contango come to us throughout the year then we get more and more confident in ramping up activity if we can hold the lead on cost or drive cost down even more. So itâs play-by-play and itâs really difficult question to answer because my concern is we erosion in pricing against the forward curve. If the Contango disappears as we go through the year and thatâs just something that we are having the wait and watch and manage on a day-to-day basis. 
When do we ramp up activity, itâs at a different oil price in the Williston and in the Permian and in Pinedale or the Uinta. So we are watching it, we have specific prices in mind for each area and of course itâs dependent on cost as well. 
Brian Gamble
May be a little bit -- you guided a pretty significant stepped function change in Q1 production I know that was partially weather impacted but as you mentioned [truncating] activity pretty quickly. Does keeping the -- does keeping your production profile from Q2 to Q4 roughly flat does that indicate that you are I guess that the forward [continue to] hold and that you are increasing activity slightly in the back half or can you do that at a flat run rate by just completing a few extra ducts here and there and depending on the better completion designs to improve total [op up] per well over the back half of the year. Do you think â¦?
Chuck Stanley
That certainly helps with a lot of it and as I said we're watching the shape of the curve and in particular in the '16 because obviously the back half of this year second half of '15 is really more about 2016 volumes and 2015 volumes just like the back half of '14 really is what's driving a significant portion of 2015. So we will be watching not only what's happening to the price in the second half of the year for 2015 realizations but also what the curve does in '16 and beyond. And if it doesn't move up substantially then we will manage the completion activity and drilling activity to a different level than if it improves dramatically in '16 and beyond. 
Brian Gamble 
And then maybe one last from me. Big cash number on the balance sheet obviously; you kind of emphasized this in the prepared remarks just because it is such a large number do you -- given your conservative nature and your ability to do pretty much whatever you want with it moving forward. Do you hold it until you find something that you want to do or do we see some debt repayments during the year to keep interest rates down knowing that if you needed more debt you could easily lever some along to do whatever to do a deal later on?
Richard Doleshek
Yes hi Brian it's Richard. We don't have any debt that makes any sense to prepay -- everything that's out there today are the senior notes that have make [hold] provisions and thatâs just sort of prolifically expensive to think about pulling those in. I think the -- what we're [and obviously] we're using this we have got a [canteen] full of water and now we're going to be judicious in how we [sit out] that canteen because hope to find good opportunities and we're not sure how long dessert is that we need to cross. So I don't think we're going to do anything on the debt repayment side in terms of trying to divide notes in the market it's really sort of earmarked for capital spending and acquisition activity.
