Good morning and welcome to the Noble Energy's Webcast and Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your moderator, Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.
Brad Whitmarsh
Thanks Anthony and thank you all for joining us today. I hope you had a great holiday weekend. This morning, we provided a number of positive updates in association with today's event. These include our 2017 reserve report, our fourth quarter earnings release and supplemental deck, along with an updated outlook release and associated slides.
In addition, yesterday, we announced significant new gas sales contracts for Leviathan and Tamar in Israel. Each of these items are available on our website in case you want to access as we progress through this morning's conference call. Later today, we plan to file our 10-K with the SEC.
I want to remind everyone that today's call contains projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures and our latest news releases and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.
This morning, I plan to provide a brief overview of fourth quarter results before handing over to Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, who will comment on our updated multi-year outlook.
Our prepared comments may go slightly longer than usual as we have quite a bit of content to cover. Following our prepared comments, we'll hold a question-and-answer session. I would ask that analysts limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Joining us for the Q&A session is Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Keith Elliott, Senior VP for The Eastern Med; and other members of management.
As we did throughout 2017, we finished the year delivering another strong quarter of financial and operational results. Total company volumes were within our anticipated sales volume range despite winter storms and facility impacts to our production in Texas.
For the quarter, U.S. onshore liquids grew to comprise two-thirds of total U.S. onshore volumes. This represented a 20,000 barrel per day increase from the third quarter with more than half the growth coming from oil.
Combined, our Texas assets grew to approximately 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter with both the Delaware and the Eagle Ford setting quarterly volume records for our business.
Our second Delaware central gathering facility began operation in December with nine wells tied into the facility by the end of the year. In addition, the DJ Basin had another strong quarter with a record oil mix of 55% that marks the sixth consecutive quarterly increase. Well results in all of our onshore basins continued to show the strength of our onshore capabilities.
We also continue to see great performance offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, which delivered more than 37,000 barrels per day of premium-priced oil in the fourth quarter.
In Israel, volumes were right down the fairway as expected and we exited the year averaging more than 1 billion cubic feet per day in December on a gross basis.
Commodity price realizations and good cost performance added to the substantial beat on earnings, cash flows, and EBITDA versus Street expectations. Of particular note on the cost side, lower DD&A reflected the substantial increase in U.S. onshore proved reserves at the end of the year.
Cash operating cost, including LOE, production tax, gathering and transport, and marketing were about $8 per BOE for the quarter. Capital spending was well within our range of expectations, and operating cash flow before working cap changes showed a significant increase over the third quarter of the year. These all represent good trends as we move into 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.
David Stover
Thanks Brad and I appreciate everyone joining us today. We have communicated a number of strategic milestones between last week and this morning. A significant announcement was the Board-authorized share repurchase program, which reflects great confidence in our ability to deliver the strong cash flow growth profile we will outline today and we believe that purchasing our shares is a great investment in our future.
Thinking about the future, there's no doubt that oil and gas will continue to be a dominant energy source, playing a vital role in the global quality of life for decades to come. Noble's demonstrated excellence in onshore and offshore operations, along with our exploration and major project capabilities, position us to be a long-term winner. The outlook we provide today is centered around a $50 oil price, utilizing our current hedge book with a sensitivity to a higher price scenario.
To be successful long-term in the E&P space, we believe a company needs to be able to thrive in a $50 world while remaining flexible to take advantage of fluctuations in commodity price. Our outlook provides that.
We also believe a sustainable company needs to be able to successfully manage geographic and commodity risk. Our portfolio is designed with multiple high return investment options in low cost, high margin areas, minimizing the potential impact from those risks and providing a clear line of sight into the next decade.
Noble Energy has taken some significant steps to transform its portfolio over the last couple of years. The sale of our Gulf of Mexico assets is the last major step in focusing our portfolio to deliver our plan.
It also enables us to ensure our exploration teams are focused on the areas that can be very material to Noble with running room based on success. I look forward to being able to announce another material exploration focus area this year.
In addition, the announcement of new sales contracts for our Eastern Med gas into Egypt provides clear visibility into the significant new cash flow that will soon be generated by that region.
Our 2017 reserve growth was extraordinary as we exited the year with just under 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves. Organic reserves were added at an extremely favorable cost, under $3 per barrel of oil equivalent, which will benefit our income generation for many years to come. As shown in the earnings release, one of the highlights for fourth quarter was the generation of income both on a GAAP and adjusted basis.
Reflecting on 2017, it was truly a turning point for Noble Energy when you consider all that was accomplished. Our portfolio was strengthened through the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy and the divestment of our Marcellus and other non-core assets. The cash from the asset sales allowed us to pay down more than $1 billion in debt last year while focusing the organization on our high margin, high return assets.
Operationally, we delivered record safety performance with a recordable incident rate almost 50% lower than our previous record. Our Delaware, DJ, and Eagle Ford teams drove program returns 15 percentage point higher than originally expected through enhanced well performance and strict cost management.
This contributed to our ability to deliver volumes and operational cash flow exceeding our original expectations. The combination of our asset performance and our proceeds provided a significant all-in upstream cash flow surplus and we ended the year with liquidity of $4.5 billion.
Our NBLX Midstream business continued to enhance its value through the delivery of multiple gathering facilities while expanding third-party opportunities. Its focus in the DJ and Delaware Basins supports our developments and rapidly grows our retained EBITDA, providing substantial feature midstream monetization opportunities.
The sanctioning of Leviathan early last year was a major milestone and the project teams are continuing to demonstrate their exceptional ability to deliver major projects on schedule and within cost.
The project is currently around 40% complete with essentially the same team that delivered the Tamar project. Our announcement of the 7.5% working interest sell-down earlier this year provides certainty around our Eastern Med ring-fencing strategy.
Yesterday's announcement of contracts potentially totaling 700 million cubic feet of day, gross, for delivery into Egypt is a significant milestone in expanding the regional market. With these latest announcements, we have now contracted almost 900 million cubic feet per day for Leviathan Phase 1.
The accomplishments from 2017 and what we have announced already this year have continued to improve the multiyear plan we outlined for you in November 2016 and updated in January 2017 after the Clayton Williams acquisition. We have provided for your reference a slide pack that discusses this outlook for 2018 through 2020 and even beyond.
One of the key highlights from this plan is substantial excess cash flow generated, totaling $1.5 billion cumulative over the three-year period on our base $50 scenario. We're taking a balanced approach to the use of this surplus cash. Half of this amount will be utilized for the recently announced share repurchase program and $600 million will be used to reduce debt. Anticipated dividend growth should account for the rest.
At strip prices, our plan delivers an additional $1.5 billion excess cash flow. Given the current backwardation of the strip, we've not assumed any incremental onshore activity in this scenario.
We would anticipate utilizing the majority of the incremental cash to accelerate our buyback and consider expanding the program, along with additional dividend increases from cash flow expansion. Beyond this, we may consider funding specific projects that can generate incremental cash flow per debt-adjusted share growth.
Now, let's look at the slides that cover our plans through 2020. I will begin by spending some time on the overall strategy and focus of the company before laying out what our plan will deliver. Gary will then review the major drivers of the plan.
We believe that formula to deliver top-tier shareholder returns across a longer term horizon and a variety of commodity price environments contains five important factors, which are shown on slide two of the multiyear outlook pack.
First and foremost, we believe sustained cash flow growth on a debt adjusted per share basis is critical to being an attractive investment option across all industries. Accordingly, driving this cash flow growth is a top priority at Noble Energy.
Second, an organization must have a relentless focus on capital efficiency and returns, which along with the previous point, will ultimately drive increasing net asset value. We're committed to delivering double-digit corporate returns while substantially growing net asset value.
Third is the alignment of incentive plans with shareholder interest. We believe management compensation needs to be in sync with shareholder interest and our incentive plans are designed accordingly.
Fourth, strong financial capacity and flexibility must be maintained throughout commodity price cycles. This is why we have prioritized debt reduction over the last couple of years. Maintaining robust liquidity, strong balance sheet, and ample financial flexibility will remain a top priority for Noble.
Finally, we believe a successful company has to be fully committed to all its stakeholders. For us, it's living our purpose, energizing the world, and bettering people's lives. Our commitment to our shareholders, our communities, our employees, and the environment is key to Noble Energy's culture and it is a core component of the company's value proposition.
Noble Energy's strategy to deliver leading shareholder return is provided on slide three, starting with the five focus areas to enhance shareholder value on the left. As shown, we're concentrating on both long-term value generation as well as near-term direct value return to shareholders. We have talked many times about our belief in having top quality assets combined with leading execution and the balance sheet strength to deliver top tier results.
On the right side of this slide, we show the four strategic cornerstones around portfolio quality, differential onshore performance, unique Eastern Mediterranean value, and cash flows and financial capacity.
Before jumping into the key outcomes of our plan, I want to highlight on slide four the transformation and strategic portfolio actions that have been delivered over the last couple of years to position Noble Energy with a top tier asset portfolio and a clear future. We've accomplished an impressive portfolio transformation while executing on our strategy to allocate capital to the highest return, highest margin assets.
Early in 2017, we solidified the largest Southern Delaware Basin acreage position with the acquisition of Clayton Williams Energy. This consolidated a nearly 120,000 acre, 2 billion barrel resource, which has huge value for our company.
Our Delaware asset base will grow to more than 140,000 barrels per day within this plan period. As a result, we do not envision our need for any additional large scale M&A in this Basin.
Given our long-term view of U.S. gas price and the resulting inability of the Marcellus to compete for capital in our portfolio, we also divested our Marcellus upstream and midstream position in 2017.
You can see a number of the other actions taken over the last couple of years as we have positioned the company with a clear focus on high margin, high return growth opportunities.
On the right-hand side of slide four, you can see the significant increased contribution of our U.S. onshore liquids over time from around 30% to more than 50%. The portfolio actions have also enabled us to pay down around $2 billion in debt over the last few years.
Turning to slide five, we highlight key takeaways from our updated outlook through 2020. I am particularly excited by our expected cash flow CAGR of 35%, which represents our pro forma capabilities after all the transformation work that has been accomplished. With our planned share buyback and debt reduction, our cash flow per debt adjusted share growth would be even higher.
Return on average capital employed is increased to 10% in 2020 at the flat $50 case. We've also outlined the improvements from a higher price scenario. Growing to 525,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020 with leverage returning to historic levels are great outcomes in either case.
I mentioned earlier the improvement from the previous plan, and on slide six and seven, we have highlighted some of these changes. I will comment on three specific items. First, on slide six. Increased confidence in Leviathan volumes at start up following our recent marketing progress has moved our base case up to 800 million cubic feet per day, year one.
Second, moving to slide seven. The graph on the bottom right shows a substantial improvement in onshore capital efficiency despite 2017 inflationary pressures. This is primarily driven by improved type curves in both the DJ and Delaware Basins with similar volumes on lower capital and even fewer wells from the prior plan.
Third, on the top left of the slide is highlighted our improved total company margins, up 30% versus our plan one year ago, driven by the increased focus on liquids and Eastern Med gas along with the reduced operating cost outlook as well.
All of this leads to attractive pro forma volume growth and even more attractive cash flow growth as we have shown on slide eight. Steady volume and cash flow growth is expected over the next two years, driven by the strength of our U.S. onshore business and then with 2020 comes another step change as Leviathan starts production. Company volumes are anticipated to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate with operating cash flow growing almost twice as fast as volumes.
In 2020, at the base scenario, we're selling 525,000 barrels equivalent per day, 70% of which is U.S. onshore liquids and Israel gas and generating more than $750 million organic free cash flow. These outcomes are result of the focused portfolio and capital allocation priorities we have described.
On slide nine, we show that more than 95% of our capital will continue to go to the U.S. onshore business and Eastern Mediterranean. The Leviathan project remains on schedule and on budget, and you can see this capital falls off in 2019 and then completely in 2020 as the project starts up.
I've mentioned the free cash flow generation, and on slide 10, we show the sum total of sources and uses of cash. The current dividend is already included in the uses and in combination with the share repurchase, would provide at least $1.35 billion in return to shareholders over this period.
With anticipated dividend growth as cash flow increases, the incremental shareholder return could be closer to 60% of the free cash flow in the $50 case. The targeted debt reduction of $600 million would account for the remaining 40%, one-third of which was already accomplished in January. We will continue to take advantage of upward commodity price movements to layer in some higher price hedges.
I mentioned this earlier, but I want to be clear on our priorities. Given the current backwardation of the strip, we are not assuming any incremental onshore activity over what is included in the base plan.
We would anticipate utilizing incremental cash to accelerate our buyback and consider expanding this program, while also anticipating additional dividend increases. A portion of the incremental cash may be considered for specific projects that can generate additional shareholder value.
Turning to slide 11. We're focused on making sure our company incentive plans are aligned with shareholder interest. We've been proactive in increasing our emphasis on returns and cash flow on our plans over the last several years. Short-term incentive plan metrics that have been de-emphasized are shown in red, and those with increased weighting are depicted in green.
This year, we are adding consideration of multiple corporate return metrics and cash flow per debt adjusted share to our short-term incentive plan, while increasing the emphasis on performance units in our long-term incentive plan.
Before handing over to Gary, I want to comment on the capability of our business beyond the three-year plan that we have provided today. On slide 12, taking a look at the next three years post 2020, we expect to generate between $1.5 billion and $2 billion per year in organic free cash flow, continue improvement in corporate returns, and a production outlook that is growing consistently.
These outcomes beyond 2020 are driven by the depth and quality of our onshore portfolio with multiple decades of drilling inventory combined with our Eastern Mediterranean business, which provides repeatable, steady cash flow annually, along with significant expansion potential. We've certainly envisioned investing in additional projects while still generating substantial free cash flow.
That's a high level review of our portfolio plan and our company focus. The strategy hasn't changed, our value proposition is clear.
With that, I'll hand it over to Gary for an update on the operations.
Gary Willingham
Thanks Dave. As Dave just noted, our strategy remains the same. We will continue to allocate 95% of our capital to our highest margin, highest returning assets in the U.S. onshore and Eastern Mediterranean. Growth of these assets will drive the material cash flow growth that positions Noble for peer-leading total shareholder returns.
At each of these areas, we've made meaningful changes to set the stage for our enhanced cash flow generation and corporate returns outlook that Dave shared. This morning, I'll walk through the key updates from our prior plan from January 2017, beginning with the U.S. onshore.
In 2017, we enhanced our U.S. onshore portfolio by adding to our Delaware Basin position with the Clayton Williams Energy assets and also by divesting our Marcellus operations. And with this transition, we're focused in top liquids rich, low cost basins with multiple decades of high return inventory as we show on slide 14.
Our multi-basin portfolio provides optionality and flexibility for changing market demands. And I stack the quality of our assets and the strength of our execution up against any other onshore operator.
The combination of our portfolio totals 6,500 potential drilling locations with very strong rates of return, resulting in a business that can generate $900 million of asset level free cash flows over the next three years at our $50 price scenario as shown on slide 15. In 2020, our onshore business grows to a total of 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Also on slide 15, we've outlined the role each of our assets plays within our U.S. onshore portfolio to achieve this plan. The growth engine is the Delaware Basin. With its exceptional economics and large inventory, the Delaware will deliver substantial growth every year over the plan and is the leading contributor to Noble's oil growth.
In the DJ Basin, we've delivered significant performance improvements over the past few years. The increased productivity from enhanced completions is driving greater capital efficiency.
And over the next three years, the DJ Basin will deliver meaningful growth while generating significant free cash flow. Growth in the DJ will accelerate beginning in 2019, reflecting the timing of our 2018 activity, the higher productivity of the Mustang area, and the increasing infrastructure capacity.
In the Eagle Ford, following rapid growth in 2017, we expect to maintain flat production year-over-year through 2020, while generating substantial free cash flow.
Combined this plan delivers very competitive growth for our onshore business with volumes growing at a compound annual rate of 25% over the next three years and oil growing even faster at 31%. The volume growth over the next three years is right in line with our prior plan.
However, shown on 16, we expect to achieve those same volumes with $500 million of less capital, which speaks to the exceptional jobs the teams continue to do to deliver greater capital efficiency.
The DJ Basin is a significant contributor to this improvement. Given the strong well performance we realized from enhanced completions in 2017, we've increased our type curves by 25% on average in our near-term focus areas. The productivity increase per well delivers the same volume with significantly fewer wells online over the plan period.
In the Delaware, we've increased our type curves 20% to 25% for the Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp A upper based on the strong results we've delivered to-date. At the same time, we're releasing significant operating efficiencies as we've transitioned our program to long laterals and multi-well pad development. These include a 35% reduction in drilling cost per lateral foot from 2016 to 2017 across our entire Delaware position and significant improvements in cycle-time.
Importantly, our Wolfcamp A well cost have remained flat to our prior plan. The efficiencies we've gained, along with modifications in our completion design, have offset the impacts of higher intensity completions while also absorbing service cost inflation experienced in 2017. This is remarkable considering our proppant loadings have increased significantly above what was originally planned.
2017 was marked with a number of significant accomplishments in the Delaware. These include integrating the Clayton Williams assets, progressing our multi-horizon development program and executing significant infrastructure build outs, including the start-up of two central gathering facilities operated by Noble Midstream.
On top of this, we had outstanding well performance. On slide 17, we've highlighted this performance through third-party analysis of available state data. In just a few years of developing this asset, we've already demonstrated superior well performance with Noble's oil production per 1,000 lateral foot the highest in Reeves County and it's 58% above the average of other operators.
We've progressed our activity from delineation to full field development mode, concentrating on multi-well pods and long laterals. And one area I'd like to point out is the encouraging results we've seen from the Calamity Jane 7 well pad, which is covered in more detail in our fourth quarter supplemental slides.
This was our initial test with multiple Third Bone Spring, Wolfcamp A Upper and Wolfcamp A Lower wells, which target a half section development using our planned lateral and vertical spacing assumptions.
In early days, the wells are exhibiting very encouraging results with a lower GOR than originally expected, resulting in about 70% oil. In particular, the two Third Bone Spring wells averaged an IP-30 of 2,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 350 BOED per 1,000 lateral feet, exceeding our prior Third Bone Spring Monroe well. Wolfcamp A Uppers have also outperformed expectation with an IP-30 of 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or approximately 315 BOED per 1,000 feet.
We're seeing highly effective containment and no evidence of communication between the wells across the Third Bone Spring and Wolfcamp A, which provides us further confidence in our well spacing assumptions and go-forward development plans.
Slide 18 shows our increased type curve expectations for each zone in the Delaware. The Wolfcamp A type curves are now split between the Upper and Lower zones, and they are shown compared to the prior blended average.
Through our acquisitions of Rosetta Resources in 2015 and Clayton Williams Energy in 2017, we've established a highly contiguous position, the largest in Southern -- in the Southern Delaware Basin.
Prior to Noble's ownership of these assets, neither was set up for impactful growth. With the implementation of our integrated development plan philosophy, these assets are now positioned to realize their full potential. With great execution in 2017, we're currently well on our way to deliver value above our assumptions at the time of the acquisition as we've outlined on slide 19.
We've transitioned to pad development drilling with nearly all of our activity focused on two-section lateral wells, increasing the average lateral length by 60% from Clayton Williams.
At the same time, we've continued to reduce drilling time from 26 days for a 5,800 foot lateral well drilled prior to the acquisition to 23 days for a 10,000-foot lateral. We focused on multi-horizon co-development, which not only drives efficiencies, but optimizes full reservoir potential and value creation.
We've gained further sub-surface knowledge with 3D seismic data across the acreage position integrated into our geo-steering workflows. With optimized well landings, our drilling precision is within a 15-foot target interval across a two-mile long lateral. This rigorous precision is critical for stacked pay development.
With our integrated midstream approach, we're building the infrastructure that supports our long-term plans while significantly reducing capital investment and returning more value.
Approximately a year after the close of Clayton Williams, we'll have two central gathering facilities operated by Noble Midstream servicing the legacy Clayton acreage and connected to our water network. Across the entirety of our Delaware acreage, we'll have five CGFs online by midyear, creating the foundation for the substantial growth with this asset over the next few years.
Fair to the assumptions at the time of the acquisitions, our raised type curves represent a 25% increase to the blended Wolfcamp A type curve from Clayton Williams and over a 50% increase to the Rosetta type curve. This combination of increased productivity while maintaining flat well costs is delivering significantly more value.
In fact, less than a year from closing the Clayton Williams acquisition, we now estimate we've increased the per well value of those assets by 20% versus our expectations at the time of the transaction.
We've also been very encouraged by the results we've seen from tests in the Wolfcamp B and C zones across the acreage position. We highlighted the continued performance of the Cole Younger Wolfcamp B well in our fourth quarter supplemental materials. The well is averaging nearly 350 barrels of oil equivalent per day per 1,000 lateral foot over the first 90 days on production.
There's certainly sizable value upside from these additional zones, considering we attributed nearly all the value from acquisitions, the Wolfcamp A zone. While the majority of our activity will remain focused on the Wolfcamp A and Third Bone Spring, we'll continue to test the Wolfcamp B and C until they're fully integrated into our development plans.
Moving to the DJ, we've shown our acreage map on slide 20. Over the past few years, we strategically focused our operations in rural areas away from urban development and in liquids rich, large, contiguous positions ideal for capital efficient long lateral, multi-well development plans. We've accomplished this through several strategic acreage exchanges which blocked up our acreage position in our core IDP areas.
In addition, we generated over $1 billion by monetizing areas that we were not going to get to for quite some time, given the extensive high return inventory in our key IDP areas. Importantly, given that the divested acreage remains dedicated to Noble Midstream, we further benefited from the accelerated development of those assets.
Overall, these transformations created a contiguous acreage position of significant scale in the liquids rich, highly productive part of the Basin. It's prime for our IDP philosophy and long lateral development and it's far away from surface development challenges experienced by other operators.
Focused in this high quality acreage position, we delivered fantastic results in 2017 from the Wells Ranch and East Pony development areas. With the lessons we've learned over time, we've tailored our completion designs to maximize the value of our program.
We've progressed our basin leading enhanced completion designs to use a standard of 1,800 pounds per lateral foot, up from 1,400 pounds per foot previously. We also continue to evaluate the optimal stage and cluster spacing.
I'd like to draw your attention to the graph on slide 20, where we've shown the same third-party analysis and of data from 2017 wells. Noble stands out from the pack, delivering two and a half times the basin average for oil productivity per foot. This is another clear example of where Noble delivers more from a well than others.
I expect this focus on oil-rich areas to continue over the next few years. We saw great results in East Pony from enhanced completions in 2017 and this has expanded our view of the potential for the remaining inventory in this area. We'll bring on a handful of wells in East Pony over the next few years while we work our larger developments through the federal permitting process. These developments will be permitted for our optimal higher intensity completion design.
Over the next three years, our development will be focused primarily in the lower-GOR areas of Wells Ranch and Mustang, where we have extensive high return inventory. Our updated type curves for these areas are shown on slide 21.
And interestingly, the oil production per lateral foot that we've shown in the new Mustang and Wells Ranch type curves is very similar to the results we saw in East Pony in 2017, given the higher EURs even with a slightly lower oil cut.
We've [technical difficulty] sometime about the next leg of growth in the DJ coming from the Mustang IDP. With similar rock quality and GOR to Wells Ranch, we view Mustang as an opportunity to replicate the successes of Wells Ranch and apply the lessons learned from across our U.S. onshore operations.
We're optimizing the development across the Mustang IDP, leveraging the row concept we utilized in the Eagle Ford. This will maximize capital efficiency by improving cycle times and the sharing of EcoNode facilities.
We originally saw the uplift from enhanced completions in the Marcellus and have replicated this in Texas and across the DJ Basin. Based on what we've seen with similar reservoir characteristics in Wells Ranch along with the strong well results from bolder completion designs on the Mosher pad, we're confident we will see strong well performance in Mustang.
Finally, in conjunction with our midstream partners, we're utilizing best practices learned from Wells Ranch infrastructure to protect our volumes from potential downstream processing constraints.
With the initial wells coming online midyear in Mustang and continued development of Wells Ranch, I'm confident we will continue to see the strong industry-leading productivity that we have shown over the past few years from our other developments.
Moving to our Eastern Mediterranean assets, I think this is an area that truly differentiates Noble. The sustained cash flow profile from these world-class reservoirs, coupled with stable pricing and minimal maintenance capital, will continue to benefit Noble Energy for years to come as shown on slide 24.
As Dave mentioned earlier, we've increased our base case assumptions for Leviathan volumes in 2020 to 800 million cubic feet a day gross. In fact, this is conservative estimate, given the agreements we've already announced.
Beyond what we have contracted, there are substantial remaining opportunity in both the regional export market and within Israel. The graph on slide 25 shows that in 2013, coal fueled over 50% of Israel's electric power generation.
Since then, supported by the exceptionally reliable production from Tamar, coal power dispatch has been reduced to under 35% of power generation in 2017. This trend will continue into 2018 and beyond as the government mandates further switching from coal. We expect there to be another 450 million to 700 million cubic feet of demand in Israel alone from power, transportation and industrial growth.
As you saw in our announcement yesterday, we have executed two exciting new export contracts to Egypt, a firm contract of 350 million a day for Leviathan and an interruptible contract for up to 350 million a day for Tamar highlighted on slide 26. This natural gas was anticipated to help supply Egypt's industrial, petrochemical and power generation demand.
These agreements continue to demonstrate the strength of the regional demand for our natural gas and provide further clarity and confidence in our cash flow profile. And we continue to see Egypt demand grow. In fact, as we've spent more time in the country, we see even stronger evidence of more latent domestic demand than we have assumed in this plan.
Our team remains on track to deliver Leviathan first gas by late next year within budget. The project is approximately 40% complete and the drilling rig will be arriving on site within the next month. 2018 will be a busy year for our team with the completion of four wells, ongoing facility construction and start of field installation.
With the significant portfolio changes, including the Gulf of Mexico sale announced last week and the Tamar working interest sale, as well as 2017 portfolio actions, important to understand the pro forma impacts of each of these transactions. Affecting all of these items back to January 1, 2017, our pro forma sales volume for 2017 equated to 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Considering these changes, 2018 volumes are right where we expected in our prior plan and up, pro forma, 12% from 2017.
On slide 28, we've provided a graph showing the pro forma adjustments along with the 2018 guidance range and additional details on these adjustments were also included in the appendix.
Before handing the call back over to Dave, I want to take some time to cover our key objectives for 2018, which sets the stage for our three-year outlook. We expect to grow U.S. onshore cash flows while continuing our focus on capital efficiency. U.S. onshore volumes are expected to be up over 20% from 2017 pro forma on flat capital.
We will continue to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in U.S. onshore oil in 2018, both on absolute and as a percentage of total volumes, driven primarily by the Delaware Basin. Midstream build-out will progress in the Delaware and DJ Basins in support of the upstream growth, which ultimately grows the midstream value of Noble.
We'll progress our world-class Leviathan project for start-up late next year. As we've said before, the $750 million of capital expenditures are more than covered by the previously announced 7.5% working interest sale and the Tamar cash flows.
The momentum that we are generating in the Delaware, along with the return to growth in the DJ, position our onshore business to deliver approximately 25% growth in 2019 over 2018.
Continued onshore growth, along with a full year of Leviathan volumes, provide over 30% growth for the total company from 2019 into 2020. This growth, focused on our higher-margin areas, drives our total company cash flow growth even higher.
With that, let me hand the call back over to Dave.
David Stover
Thanks Gary. I'll conclude with slide 29, which highlights three key points: Our commitment to returning value to our shareholders, our proven execution excellence, and our high quality asset base and inventory that provide visibility to sustainable differential value creation through 2020 and beyond. It is the combination of our strategy and our highly capable workforce that will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.
This time, Anthony, we will open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles Meade
Good morning Dave to you and your team there.
David Stover
Hey Charles.
Charles Meade
Dave, you hit this point at least twice and maybe more, this issue of returning cash to shareholders. But I'm wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on how your decision process in balancing investing in the portfolio versus some different avenues of returning cash to shareholders.
Is there a percentage of your cash flow that you're targeting for dividend payout? Or alternatively, is there a metric that you're looking at on your share price or your valuation that would tip you more towards buying back shares versus increasing the dividend?
David Stover
I think, Charles, you're right. We did touch on this a couple of times in the discussion. I'll tell you how I think about it. We're now at the place and when you look at the valuation of the company relative to recognizing the significant cash flow growth that's come up in front of us, it's a great time to start our share reduction, our share buyback provision now, which we announced last week. I think so the priority is getting that implemented now and we're doing that because we've got a clear line of sight, as we've laid out on cash flow that can support that.
I think as I mentioned in the call from the dividend perspective, we would anticipate that our dividend will continue to grow as the cash flow grows and we'll manage that in sync with the cash flow growth and just as we've done in the past.
So, I think specifically from a priority standpoint and timing, it's a great time to implement the share repurchase with the actions that have been taken to create the cash flow visibility. I think the dividend will grow as cash flow continues to grow. And I think that sets us up well to provide significant shareholder return over the plan period.
In fact, I think what I mentioned in there was the anticipation of the cash flow growth, we could return probably 60% of that $1.5 billion even at a $50 case directly to shareholders.
Charles Meade
Right, right. I heard that. That's a big, big slice there. And Dave going back one other thing and this perhaps works in with the longer-term outlook. I think in your prepared comments, you talked about looking forward to announcing a new exploration area this year. And I'm wondering if I got that right. And even if I didn't, can you talk about how exploration fits in your portfolio through 2020 and beyond?
David Stover
Yes, Charles, it's a great question. It's very observant because I do expect that, given our focus on continuing to have three to four team material aspiration areas, and actually the opportunity in the market right now for folks like us that have maintained that capability and are very proficient in that part of the business has been an excellent time to look at new opportunities that can be extremely material going forward. And I think we'll have the opportunity to highlight at least one of those as we move through the year, one additional one.
Charles Meade
Dave, thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
David Stover
Thanks Charles.

Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram
Yes, good morning. Dave, I wondered if you could comment on what type of impact the gas sales agreement to Egypt is having in terms of domestic customers in Israel. And could this positively impact your ability to get up to 1.2 Bcf a day contracted for Phase 1 of Leviathan?
David Stover
Well, let me to start, the last part of it. Absolutely, it positively impacts our ability to get Leviathan filled up for Phase 1. I mean, this is a huge impact, Arun. I think one of the questions that have been out there was, is there still a desire from Egypt to bring in our gas? And I think when this answers and should highlight is they want as much of our gas as quick as we can deliver it.
I think on the domestic front in Israel, I think it also highlights that -- and we're in a number of discussions there that it's an opportunity to jump in and fill up the remaining volume capacity that we have in Phase 1, and then as we do that, be able to look at was the progression beyond Phase 1.
But I think the main answer to your question, absolutely it gives us a lot of confidence in being able to fill up Phase 1. Between the combination of Jordan, Israel and Egypt, I have no doubt that that will happen.
Arun Jayaram
And then just quickly, for your 800 million a day gross volume expectation for 2020, does that reflect your expectation that you'd be fully contracted. And perhaps just the ramp in volumes throughout the year, give us a little bit of color on what that assumes in terms of 2020.
David Stover
Yes, essentially, it assumes just the contracts that we've announced to-date, including the Egyptian portion and then taking into account how they ramp up in that first year. 
Arun Jayaram
Okay, great. And then my follow--
David Stover
Incremental contracts may adjust that as we move forward.
Arun Jayaram
Great. And my follow-up is I just needed a little bit of help in recognizing -- in reconciling the $1.5 billion of free cash flow generation over the plan period. Can you just help us understand what type of monetization proceeds does that incorporate?
David Stover
Well, I think beyond what we've announced so far, what you're really looking at is the additional midstream contribution. We've always talked about a drop per year type of thing, so there's a lot of value that will be recognized from our mainstream business over that period of time. And then we have the units, both in Tamar petroleum and in CONE that will monetize over that period of time.
Arun Jayaram
Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer
Thank you. Good morning.
David Stover
Hey Brian.
Brian Singer
You highlighted the substantial increases in type curves in the DJ Basin, about 25%. And I know you spent some time in the presentation talking about Mustang and the improvement there. But can you just talk about how your productivity and capital efficiency changes in 2018 and 2019 relative to, say, the last year as you shift a little bit more away from East Pony and a little bit more towards Mustang?
And as part of that, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments with regards to East Pony, that there may be some greater inventory that emerged from some of the drilling and productivity work from 2017. If you could talk more about that.
Gary Willingham
Yes, Brian, this is Gary. Yes, I mean, in the last couple of years, we've had most of the activity focused in Wells Ranch and East Pony, as you're aware. The focus on East Pony has been driven by a couple of things. It's the highest oil content area that we've got and we certainly saw the benefits of focusing on oil versus gas over the last couple of years.
And then it's also been off of our primary third-party midstream provider up there, which got us gas into our own plants and not subject to the constraints that have been in the basin.
So, we've delivered some really great results up there. I think those results, taking your -- the second part of your question, those results have caused us to go back and look at the IDP more broadly. And I think we've got probably more potential there over the coming years than maybe we thought a year ago and we'll continue to work that.
And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, work the permitting issues associated with that, since a lot of that is on federal acreage and we'll go back to that area here in the next couple of years and start drilling some more.
In the meantime, we are shifting to Mustang from a capital efficiency standpoint. When you think about capital efficiency as resources delivered, production delivered per dollar spent, Mustang is certainly higher capital efficiency than East Pony is. You saw the type curve that we laid out is 1.3 million barrels for the Mustang area. And so that's a much higher efficiency than what we've been seeing in East Pony. It is a bit gassier.
And the interesting thing, as I noted in the prepared comments, is given that higher EUR, even with a little bit lower oil cut per lateral foot basis, it actually delivers just as much oil per lateral foot as East Pony does.
So, still very phenomenal wells. We're excited to move the Mustang. We've been talking about it for a couple of years now as our next IDP for growth. And we've spent the latter part of 2017 and the first part of 2018 getting ready for that growth, laying out our pads, getting the infrastructure in place and timing that development so that it comes on kind of midyear as the infrastructure capacity on the gas side in the primary part of the Basin increases. So, looking forward to that, expecting some phenomenal wells in that area.
Brian Singer
Great. Thank you. And my follow-up is with regards to Israel gas. What would you need to see to convert this new Tamar contract that you've signed to export to Egypt from interruptible to firm? Is it just simply proceeding with an expansion? Is it have to do with the domestic market? Or do you need to have more confidence in the overall resource?
David Stover
Well, I don't think it's any lack of confidence in the overall resource. The resource is pretty well established. And in fact, I think we saw that the resource actually grew over this past year with some additional work. So, I think that's pretty well defined and extremely high quality and large.
I think really, Brian, it's just going to be a little bit of time. I think it's going to be some time to move forward, see some of this gas moving and then be working with the partners on the right time to make the next decision there. But as you highlighted, it's a great opportunity for us.
Brian Singer
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Doug Leggate
Thanks. Good morning everybody. Dave thanks for all the details this morning. Two questions, if I may. I guess the first one is on Israel. The Tamar contract, is that -- the interruptible nature of that, does that some way smooth out the seasonality of sales?
And I guess my follow-up on the 2023 guidance that you gave. I know that's very long-term, but what are you assuming in there for further expansions on Tamar -- I'm sorry, on Leviathan? And what would the implications be for capital if you did? And I've got a follow-up, please.
David Stover
Yes, I think on the first part, definitely implementing the interruptible contract would smooth out any seasonality and it would kind of level out the whole system. I think when you look at the longer term, I think the question was in 2023, what have we assumed in there?
We haven't input the assumption of the expansion or the next phase of Leviathan. I'll tell you when you look at it though and looking at the numbers, where you're generating $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year of cash flow, you can easily absorb those projects and still have a significant amount of cash flow.
Doug Leggate
Maybe ask the question differently, Dave. You've obviously moved quite quickly in getting the proportion of Phase 1 secured. So, where are you in the negotiations for moving to a larger development over time? Are those discussions started? Or are they ongoing? When do you expect to be able to talk about that?
David Stover
I don't know. Let me let Keith kind of talk to you how he thinks about it.
Keith Elliott
Yes, Doug. I mean, certainly, we have, in our longer range plans, we've thought about the Phase 2 expansion. But our focus right now is filling Phase 1 at start-up and moving that to -- moving that project forward.
We're really, really pleased that we've been able to demonstrate the confidence in the Egyptian market there as the demand in Egyptian market. And we just see that there's further opportunity as that matures as well as continued growth in the Israel domestic market.
David Stover
Doug, to your point, I think -- and what I've talked about many times, is that the demand that we see on the contracts and the progress that we see as we fill up Phase 1 and the demand beyond Phase 1 will drive the timing of the next phase. I think part of what you're getting at, though, is also that the next phase of development for Leviathan will probably be even more cost-efficient than the first phase, given how we set up that up initially.
Doug Leggate
Okay. Dave, my follow-up, hopefully a quick one. Given the guidance on the DJ Delaware, split, and Eagle Ford flat, I guess, should we assume that all the line pressures issues in the DJ are kind of now a thing of the past? And what have you assumed your guidance? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Gary Willingham
Yes, Doug. I mean, they're not yet, right? I mean, that's why we've talked about how we've tailored our program over the last year with that in mind in the DJ. But the next DCP plant starts up in the third quarter this year. That's adds another 200 million a day. They've got another plant after that starting up in the first half of next year. And then there's [Indiscernible], which is another 200 million a day.
Those two plants by themselves increased their handling capacity in the basin by 50%. And then they're already, I think, having discussions about a third plant, new plant beyond that.
So, that all certainly increases the capacity. I think the interesting thing about Mustang is we've got a mix of acreage dedications there. A large part of it's dedicated to DCP. We've got some that's dedicated to a third-party and then we've got some that's actually undedicated at this point.
So, I think given all that, we feel very comfortable with where our activity is going to be focused here over the next few years, given the productivity of the wells we expect and the ability to handle that gas into the system.
Doug Leggate
Great. Thanks again fellas.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy.
Michael Hall
Thanks. I guess I wanted to come back to the outlook around free cash flow and just kind of get a high level picture from you as to what you think is like an optimal level of payout in the context of the next several years. And longer term, in the context of portfolio reinvestment and maintaining your inventory.
David Stover
I think, Michael, what we've laid out is pretty clear on how we see the use of free cash flow, both in a $50 case and a strip case over the next three years. I mean, the majority of that, as we've talked about, will go to direct return to shareholders.
I think as you go beyond 2020 and look at the amount of free cash flow in those years and the opportunity that we'll have some for some very accretive projects, they'll be a mix. But I think even in that case, probably at least half of it is still available for free cash flow for return to shareholders. And we'll see how that plays out. That's still a ways down the road.
Michael Hall
All right. Okay. That longer dated profile, I was curious about it also in the context of the commentary on exploration. Should I take that to imply that there's less than appetite for corporate and/or asset level M&A in the next several years relative to what we've seen in the last few years?
David Stover
Well, I think one of the reasons we clearly laid out our plan for next three years is to show you how we're moving forward. We've delivered what we said we would do. There was some M&A that played a role in that to getting the portfolio to where we wanted it to be, but it's where we want it to be now and that's what we're focused in on executing going forward. So, that's our emphasis.
Michael Hall
Understood. And I guess as a follow-up, just curious on the U.S. onshore growth profile in the outlook provided, what sort of additional efficiencies are being assumed, if any, through 2020? And what are the exit rig counts look like for each of the key areas?
Gary Willingham
Yes, we haven't really talked about rig counts. And given the ongoing efficiencies we continue to see on drilling wells faster, rig count means less and less I think actually. I think as far as efficiencies going forward, obviously, we've delivered tremendous efficiencies already, especially on the drilling side when you look at the progress that we've made in the Delaware Basin now drilling wells in the same or less time that are a lot longer laterals than drilled before.
So, I think there will still be efficiencies beyond that. Completion side, we'll obviously still drive things from productivity standpoint as well as just an overall capital efficiency standpoint.
So, we'll see some of that. I'd say some of that's baked in as far as our ability to deliver greater efficiencies offsetting the potential for further cost inflation in the industry, especially in more of a strip price scenario. Some of that's baked in, but I'm certainly hopeful that we'll continue to deliver more than we have baked in, like we have in the past.
Michael Hall
All right, great. Appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeoffrey Lambujon
Thanks. Good morning. Just one quick question on the Eagle Ford. Any updated thoughts on just the assets within the portfolio as you look forward? I know you've talked about being largely done following the monetization. And I realize the asset's pretty cash flow generative today. But just wondering if there's flexibility kind of in the way you look at that, in case you can bring forth some of that value. And then also if there's any more detail you can give on plans for more Upper Eagle Ford testing.
David Stover
Well, I think Gary highlighted a little bit about it, but I think we see there's still tremendous value to the Upper Eagle Ford opportunity in the combination of the Upper Eagle Ford, Lower Eagle Ford development as we've laid it out. So, I think we still have ways to go there.
Jeoffrey Lambujon
Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Scialla with Stifel.
Michael Scialla
Yes, good morning. Just wanted to see on the Delaware for your plans for 2018. Obviously, you had a lot of success, especially with the Wolfcamp B here recently. Any other zones you plan to test this year? Any news on the Wolfcamp C? You'd said that, I think, you've seen some positive results there, anything more specific on that?
Gary Willingham
Yes, Michael, we brought on one Wolfcamp C well very late in the fourth quarter, so we don't really have enough data to talk about it yet, I don't think. As far as the plans for 2018, I think as I mentioned, most of the activity is going to continue to be focused on the Third Bone Spring and the Wolfcamp A. Given the results, we could continue to deliver from both of those, especially the Third Bone Spring. That will continue to be the focus going forward.
We do have plans to test some of the other zones. We're continuing to test some of the other zones in 2018. I think most of the other zones in 2018 is really focused on the Wolfcamp C more than the B. Part of that is to continue to hold the acreage position together as well, but it's less than probably 10% of the total wells that we're going to bring on this year, probably closer to 5% in 2018.
Over the plan life, kind of the three years that we've laid out here, I would expect the Wolfcamp B and C to probably be 10% to 15% of the total locations that we drill.
Michael Scialla
Bone Spring Shale be part of that -- in that plan?
Gary Willingham
Not really any plans yet. I mean, we're continuing to focus on the intervals that we've had success with on our first three wells, right? So, as we get more testing done, our view of that could change. But given the results we've had on these first three, I'm pretty interested to continue to pursue it and see how much incremental value we can deliver from it beyond what we assumed at the time of acquisition, which was essentially very little.
I think as we continue to test it across the acreage position, our expectation is that Third Bone Spring is probably going to be productive over at least half, maybe a little more, of our acreage position. So, we've got a huge prize here I think.
Michael Scialla
Okay. Thanks. And then hate to bring it up, but it seems like it crops up every two years. Any comments on Colorado -- excuse me, the Colorado political scene at this point?
David Stover
Well, I think we're in a good place with that. I think the history over the last four years has helped put us in a good place. Probably one of the best things we've done over the last five years was get out in front of this and be more engaged, along with Anadarko in the community. And with the public up there, I think there's still a tremendous amount of support for the industry. And I expect us to be able to carry out our programs.
Michael Scialla
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe Generale.
John Herrlin
Yes. Hi. Two quick ones for me. In terms of the new exploration area you mentioned, fair to that would be onshore and not off?
David Stover
We're looking at both areas, John. Probably too early to say what will come up first.
John Herrlin
Okay. Thanks Dave. And then the second one for me is West Africa. You're kind of blowing it down. Is it really strategic, long term? Or is that going to be part of keeping a deepwater team intact?
David Stover
Well, I think the main thing there is the gas monetization opportunity that we have over there. I think Gary's team's made tremendous progress there. I expect that we'll be able to create and highlight some real value there, especially when you think about the gas resource that we have in place already discovered in that area. So, I think that's the next step for that, is to clearly be able to show and bring in to the plans what that can look like. It's very low investment cost.
John Herrlin
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dave Kistler from Simmons, Piper Jaffray.
David Kistler
Good morning guys.
David Stover
Hey Dave.
David Kistler
Following-up just a little bit on the new exploration area. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the appropriate spend for exploration is going forward? Or what the necessary spend is to keep that core competency that you guys have always had in-house?
David Stover
Yes, I think all together, when you include organizational cost, overhead and capital, what we have in place right now is a program that we're spending probably $100 million a year or less all together on that. And what that's enabled us to do is to keep that core competency and also focus on some things that we feel we can mature over the next three years to have ready, post-Leviathan, that will fit very well with that timeframe and as high cash flows that we're generating per year.
That -- then at that point in time, with appraisal and so forth, we can step that program up a little bit but also keep a pretty tight discipline on it. And I think that tight discipline, along with the market and environment we're in now, has enabled us to -- I think what you'll see over time is a significant replenishment of that portfolio with some very material opportunities.
David Kistler
Okay, I appreciate that color. And maybe traversing from that a little bit to the kind of 2021 through 2023 annual free cash flow that you guys are highlighting for us. Obviously, a portion of that might be used for harvesting whatever exploration success you have.
But can you talk a little bit about should we be looking at that number and thinking about Noble as more of a free cash flow yield story and sort of very differentiated from the strategy that took place during your transitional process to more U.S. onshore leverage and Eastern Med leverage?
David Stover
Well, I think to that point, Dave, what the transition's enabled us to do is now set out a program and a plan that gives the visibility that even with new projects like we've talked about, even with exploration success, even with Eastern Med expansion and some of these things, we're still going to be in a position to be a significant free cash flow generator out in that period of time.
David Kistler
Great. I appreciate the added color guys. And great job on the transitional process.
David Stover
Thanks Dave.
Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Grigel with Macquarie.
Paul Grigel
Hi good morning. Hitting back on the free cash flow. Where does further debt reduction or acceleration of the one and a half times leverage goal fall within the priority of dividends and share repurchases, assuming above $50 pricing moving forward?
David Stover
Well, I think what we've laid out and what we've talked about is there's not that much more debt reduction that we really need to implement. And In fact, I think what we talked about is our focus is on probably another $600 million, a third of which has already been done this year and the rest of that is all based on some favorable early calls on some debt that really will cover everything that probably even makes sense to do on the debt side over the plan period.
The nice part about it is, with all the work that's been done over the last couple of years, it's positioned us now with combination with the growing cash flow and the visibility of the cash flow over the next couple of years, that the work we've done and that visibility of increased cash flow puts us back in that one and a half or below range very, very quickly here, whether it's in the $50 case or whether it's in the strip case.
Paul Grigel
Okay. And then maybe a follow-up here for Gary. Could you guys discuss -- as touched on for the DJ with line pressure, could you discuss maybe on the Delaware side, any thoughts regarding infrastructure market outlets, both for crude and perhaps more specifically on natural gas that was put into the multi-year plan and operational execution risk there?
Gary Willingham
Yes, Paul, not a lot of concern, actually. I think our partnership, obviously, working with Noble midstream on first building out facilities within the field and then helping us deliver our product to where it ultimately needs to get to is certainly an advantage that we have on the crude side with the Advantage Pipeline and certainly with the announcement that we made on dedicating our acreage to the EPIC pipeline and having an equity investment option in that, getting that crude down to Corpus. We feel very good about our oil export from the basin.
On the gas side, a lot of noise around that right now. I think, again, with the existing agreements that we've already got in place with our partners on the gas side, no real concern in my mind on this issue.
I think given the high oil cut area that we've got certainly helps. It's nice to be 70% oil and it's nice to be partnering with folks that we feel like can take care of our gas volumes that we do have.
So, I think the basin could certainly get a little tight here in the next couple of years until some of the announced projects come online. But I feel very good about where we're at.
Paul Grigel
And then just of quick follow-up there. Do your relationships with your partners have the ability to take it beyond the hubs? Or do you sell it at the end of the process and center its FOB shipping point for them at that point in time?
Gary Willingham
Yes, I'm not going to get in, for commercial reasons, to where we actually sell that. But I will say I feel very confident with their ability to get it beyond the hub.
Paul Grigel
Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities.
Leo Mariani
Hey guys, I was hoping you could just maybe talk a little bit to your CapEx plans over the next three years. I guess you guys are guiding to roughly flat. Certainly understand that there is some outsized Leviathan CapEx here in 2018. But maybe you could just kind of give a little bit of color in terms of are you baking in some service cost increases in those out years? Or maybe, just kind of high level, how that CapEx moves around over the next few years.
David Stover
Yes, I think, Leo and we've provided a plot. I can't remember what page it was, page nine, I think it was, which highlights the capital, how it moves between the main components or the main areas of our business over the next three years.
But as we talked about, now Leviathan ramps down fairly fast next year. I mean, 2019's capital is substantially less than 2018's some. By 2020, it's kind of rolled off altogether. And what you see is some increasing capital going to the onshore business over those couple of years.
I think, as Gary mentioned, we've accounted for some inflation in our capital efficiency ability to offset and we'll just see how it plays out and whether we can continue to show efficiency improvements like we've have shown over the last couple of years and reflect in the plan. So, we'll just have to see how that plays out.
Leo Mariani
All right. Just the follow-up on the Eagle Ford and I know that's an area where maybe you don't have quite as much inventory as the DJ and the Delaware. I think you guys had said that it will show some declines from its peak in 2018.
Could you talk a little bit about how the Eagle Ford production fits into the -- as you get out into 2019 and 2020, is that expected to be held flat or it will get back in the growth mode? Just any thoughts around that.
Gary Willingham
Yes, Leo, I mean, we've talked about it on one of the slides where we kind of show the role of each part of the portfolio plays, that's on slide 15. We show Eagle Ford production being pretty flat through the plan period. There will be some ups and downs within the years.
As you know, we delivered some really phenomenal wells late last year in the South part of Gates Ranch and so we exited 2017 at a very high rate and we'll see some decline in the first part of -- actually, through 2018 until some of the 2018 drilling starts coming on. So, there will be some end-year kind of fluctuations, but overall kind of year-to-year comparison, we expect it to be pretty flat for the next few years.
Leo Mariani
All right. That's helpful there. And I guess just on Eastern Med, obviously, it's always difficult to see how things play out. But do you think it's reasonable that we'll see some incremental gas contracts in 2018, just based on where you guys are in some of these negotiations?
David Stover
Yes, definitely, Leo. I think we're in discussions. Domestic -- additional domestic contracts in Israel that, I expect, will come together this year. I have no doubt about that.
Leo Mariani
All right. Thanks guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.
Gail Nicholson
Good morning gentlemen. Just looking at the operational efficiency that you guys have gained in the Delaware as well as the DJ across the U.S. portfolio. When you look at pad sizes, how do you maximize the value of things operational efficiency gain versus limiting stranded capital with the optimal pad size? Just your thoughts there.
Gary Willingham
Yes, I mean, there's no easy answer to that. It depends on where we're at, what size fracs we're pumping, how long laterals we've drilled. I mean, it all goes to your point of cycle-time I think. So, it's something that we evaluate on kind of a case-by-case basis. Overall, I think we've transitioned to probably an average of about four wells per pad.
Gail Nicholson
Okay, great. And then just looking, you're actively adding crude hedges in 2018 and 2019. Can you talk about that strategy of your hedges? And how has that potentially changed and evolved kind as we look back to the last three to five years? And how we look forward to the next maybe three to five years?
David Stover
I'd say if you look back over time, we've kind of had the philosophy of protecting a certain amount of our cash flow with up to 50% hedging in both global liquids and domestic gas. I think as we've seen opportunities in the market over the last few months, we've taken opportunities, especially on the oil side to layer in some hedges and we'll contain to look at that.
In fact, we actually increased our authority from 50% to 75% on the global oil this year just in case we see some great opportunity to layer in some more and protect some of this cash flow, which also provides the opportunity to accelerate some of the share repurchase and provide more value -- and accelerated value for our shareholders. So, we'll look at all that.
