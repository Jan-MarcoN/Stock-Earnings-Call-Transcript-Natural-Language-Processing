Michael Tessler
John -- good morning and thank you for taking the time to discuss our second quarter 2014 results. Iâm happy to report that we had a strong quarter with solid sales growth primarily from our flagship hosted Unified Communications or UC-One business. We continue to see acceleration across both our Cloud and software products, highlighted by some significant new wins in the quarter.
Our UC-One business momentum is a result of two key factors. The first is the growing adoption of our solution by major service providers worldwide and the second is the sell-through of our customers existing market offers to their end-users.
We mentioned on prior calls our excitement about several large strategic opportunities. Iâm very happy to report that we successfully completed some of these agreements in the second quarter.
As Jim will discuss a little later, we will see some of this activity reflected into deferred revenue. While I canât share the customers name with you at this stage, let me provide some color on these wins.
The first is the new North American cable provider customer. This service provider wanted to develop a market leading offer that will meet the growing needs of its business customers. It determines that UC-One included the broad range of the communication services, the businesses are increasingly seeking to stay productive. This customer will leverage our UC-One capabilities to address the needs of small, medium business as well as large enterprises.
Their offer will include our UC-One app to provide mobile access to instant messaging and presence, desktop sharing, conferencing capabilities and more. The initial contract value is about $3 million and we recognize of approximately 12-month period, starting later this year.
We also closed a strategic deal with a major international incumbent service provider. Initially this customer will offer hosted Unified Communications in its home country with the potential to expand into other countries where it has major operating entities.
The software revenue from the first order will be recognized in 2016 and currently included in long-term deferred revenue. There also be substantial professional services revenue from this project, which is not yet been build. And finally, we completed several new BroadCloud agreements in the quarter. We continue to be very encouraged by the growing interest in and sales activity for BroadCloud.
We hosted our first very successful BroadCloud Summit in London, in May, which has led substantial new sales activity throughout the region. We will host our second European BroadCloud Summit in September when we announced the commercial availability of the service for Germany.
Weâre also excited by the velocity of our sell-through by our existing BroadCloud customers, as our monthly users now exceed 100,000. As we continue to assist with significant pre-launch activities of those BroadCloud customers not yet in market, we consulted in many go-to-market activities with our BroadCloud customers in the second quarter, including helping them to find their offers, assisting with the development of sales compensation strategies and sales enablement tools and providing guidance on their broader commercial launch marketing strategies. Some of these customers will formally introduce their BroadCloud support offers later this year.
You may have seen announcement this morning about our acquisition of SDD, a leading services provider for the hospitality market, a market that includes 12 million hotel rooms across 128,000 properties globally.
By combining SDDâs JAZZ Fusion SaaS services with our communications services, we believe that we will be -- we will enable our operators to capture a significant new market opportunity. Let me provide some background on this opportunity.
Hotel owners around the world are faced with the challenges of very old PBX solutions, that have reached their end of life, and increasingly expensive to operate. And many of these property owners do not have the technical expertise to run complex communication solutions and are seeking to significantly lower the cost and complexity of their infrastructure. This is especially important as in-room telephony is no longer the profit center for the hotel property that it once was. As a result, these businesses are actively seeking cloud provided communication services to align with their corporate IT cloud migration strategies to save money and free resources that can be focused on more efficient guest services.
Today SDD provides JAZZ Fusion to many of the largest and most prominent global hotel brands worldwide. Our acquisition of SDD has enabled us to develop a new market offer UC-One hospitality. UC-One hospitality will allow our service provider customers to offer a unified solution that enables hospitality properties to provide a broad range of new communications and integrated services, allowing these properties to create customized services using dynamic targeted pricing, packaging and service authentication.
UC-One hospitality builds on our unique open platform strategy by leveraging JAZZ Fusion to seamlessly integrate our Unified Communication services with property and guest service management platforms. We believe these tightly integrated capabilities will provide hotel staff immediate access to information they need to provide a superior hotel stay experience to their customers. We believe the offering will also provide significant economic benefits to hotels and hotel groups, as they move the cloud based communications.
The SDD team has a deep understanding of the business challenges hotel and property management companies face, and Iâm very excited to have this experienced team with their strong relationships with the global hospitality brands join BroadSoft.
So to summarize, weâve had a strong quarter driven by strong billings and revenue, resulting from our customer base. Our growth comes from acquiring new customers, expanding our presence with these global operators, and successful sell-through of our solutions.
Weâre committed to increasing our long-term strategic value to our customers as evidenced by an introduction of UC-One hospitality. More broadly, weâre excited about the momentum weâre experiencing and the profound market opportunity in front of us for unified communications.
Little later, Iâd be happy to answer any questions that you may have, but now Iâll turn the call over to Jim, who will go over the financial results and our outlook for the third quarter and full-year. Jim?
James A. Tholen
Thanks, Mike. Let me provide some key financial highlights before I go into more detail regarding our Q2 results and our guidance for Q3 and the full-year 2014.
For Q2, total revenue was $52.5 million, up 19%, from the year-ago quarter. Billings, which we defined as revenue plus a net change in deferred revenue were $59.2 million, up 30% year-over-year. From a product perspective, our unified communications business had a very strong quarter. On a geographic basis, year-over-year billings growth was led by Europe.
We had one customer that accounted for greater than 10% of revenue in the quarter, but that customer we recorded $4.3 million in revenue from the large $18 million plus project we had referred to on previous earnings call. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.31.
Now let me provide you a bit more color on our Q2 revenue and billings. Software license revenue was $25.6 million, up 4% year-over-year. Software license billings were $29.3 million, up 11% year-over-year. On a billings basis, our core hosted UC business was a key growth engine and all international geographies showed strong year-over-year growth. Weâre pleased that we also saw strong sell-through on hosted licenses during the quarter.
Our subscription and maintenance support revenue, which includes our BroadCloud business was up 35% year-over-year to $22 million. Maintenance support revenue was up 15% year-over-year. Cloud SaaS revenue of $5.7 million grew from $2.2 million in the year-ago period and from $5.6 million in Q1.
As we mentioned at our Analyst Day, our cloud business has two components, one consists of our core UC services and the other is legacy direct to enterprise products from acquired companies. On a sequential basis, the UC services component grew very nicely and was up nearly 10% quarter-over-quarter. This was offset somewhat by a 20% plus sequential decline in the legacy business.
In Q2, the legacy business represented about 16% of the cloud total and we expect that number to continue to decline over time. Total subscription and maintenance support billings were $20.8 million, up 36% from year-ago.
Professional services and other revenue of $4.9 million was up 62% from the year-ago period, while professional services and other billings of $9.1 million were up 148% from the year-ago quarter. The billings growth was driven by increased customer activity and milestone based invoicing on a couple of large projects.
Now moving on to costs and margins. In Q2, we had gross margin of 76% versus 82% in the year-ago quarter. Software gross margin remained at 90% plus, subscription and maintenance support gross margin was 68%, down from 78% in the year-ago period and professional services and other gross margin of 27% was up from 14% in the year-ago period.
Overall gross margin was impacted by both the decline in subscription gross margin and from subscriptions increased in our overall revenue mix. Specifically, we saw decline in our SaaS gross margin that was impacted by some one-time items as well as our investment in the business. Given the significant scale economies inherent in this business, we remain comfortable with our long-term expectation of 70% to 80% gross margins for cloud. For Q3, 2014 Iâd expect the overall cost of sales to increase a bit from Q2 levels impacted by our SDD acquisition.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $30.6 million and operating margin was 18%. For Q3, 2014 we expect operating expense to be up slightly from Q2 levels due to ongoing costs from the SDD acquisition as well as one-time transaction costs of about $300,000.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $198.7 million at the end of the second quarter. Accounts receivable of $59.5 million, were up $6.1 million from Q1. Deferred revenue of $80.8 million was up $6.7 million from Q1.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we want a very strategic international deal during the quarter. The increase in our long-term deferred balance is driven by initial software billings from that deal and we expect revenue recognition on the project along with associated professional services in 2016.
CapEx for the quarter was an above trend line $3.9 million, primarily as a result of investment in our cloud infrastructure. Our expectation is for second half of the year CapEx to be about $3 million to $3.5 million in total.
Now Iâd like to spend some time talking about our Q3, 2014 and full-year 2014 outlook. As you've seen in our press release, we expect Q3 revenue to be in the range of $48 million to $52 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.36. For the full-year 2014, we now expect revenue in the range of $207 million to $213 million and continue to expect that non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.46.
Our expectations for the core BroadSoft business remain unchanged from our previous outlook. The $1 million increase to our previous revenue range is driven by the SDD acquisition. The revenue should be fairly ratably distributed over the remaining months in the year. We expect the acquisition to be diluted by $0.01 to $0.02 in 2014, but we believe we will be able to absorb that and thus there is no change to our previous EPS guidance. For 2015, we believe we will have another $0.02 of dilution and that acquisition will be accretive following that.
Iâd like to provide a little color regarding guidance. We feel very positive about our business competitive position and market opportunity. We clearly feel good about our perspective performance for the rest of the year, given our reaffirmation of annual guidance. While I recognize that our Q3 guidance a bit lower than the Q2 we just posted. That to me is solely a matter of how we think the second half will play out and really is not a comment on the tone or direction of our business overall.
So overall we were happy with the quarter, which was marked by strengthened billings revenue and new customer project wins, and our go forward business momentum. We also continue to make progress in growing our strategic cloud business, which we believe will be very positive to our business model over time.
With that, Iâll turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, can you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company
Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I wanted to just get a quick clarification here. So the SDD transaction that is $1 million in revenue that business is doing, I just want to make sure that there is no adjustment to the revenue expectation for the full-year, sans that acquisition?
James A. Tholen
Thatâs correct George. We think it will be a little north of $1 million for the rest of the year and thatâs what we did to bump the revenue number.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company
Got it. Okay. And then for -- so just looking at your, I guess guidance for Q4, I guess implicitly netting out the full-year versus the first three quarters. I think that kind of gets you guys somewhere between $60 million and $66 million in revenue for the quarter. How do you feel about the end of the year typically you guys see budget flush, I know there have been years where youâve not seen budget flush, but can you kind of talk us through which you guys are seeing in terms of Q4 outlook and budget flush?
James A. Tholen
Yes, so -- itâs exactly correct. And I think weâre expecting a pretty normal positive Q4 much like we saw last year where we saw really strong buying by our customers. You may remember we were in the 70s on billings for Q4. It had a pretty big acceleration in revenue from Q3 last year and I think this year will play out quite similarly. The bottom is up forecast for us for -- from where weâre sitting now for Q4 looks strong.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company
Got it. Okay. And then, just given how, I guess, per your comments earlier about how you see the balance of the year playing out, are there explicit signs in the business right now that suggest that more of the opportunity in the second half for the year shifting from Q3 to Q4 or is this just sort of you guys kind of looking back and looking at precedents from prior years, I guess Iâm trying to understand exactly how the interplay from Q3 to Q4 works?
James A. Tholen
Yes, I actually think it will play fairly normally from past years. Again, you look at last year and Q3 was not the strongest quarter we ever posted and then Q4 was very, very strong. And look, Q3 can be a little tricky, you have publication, you have a very short selling window in Europe and then -- you really hit it strong for the rest of the year. So I think itâs a pretty normal sequence for us.
George Notter - Jefferies & Company
Got it. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty.
Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Company
(Audio break) taking my question. One housekeeping item. Did I miss your U.S revenue contribution, Jim?
James A. Tholen
So yes -- so U.S was down little bit on a revenue basis. Billings looked fine. Iâd say that -- just to put a little color to that, on a unified communications -- on the unified communications business, Europe was -- U.S was up quite nicely. We still have remnants from first half of last year and specifically Q2 of last year on some consumer revenue. We had actually pretty good consumer quarter Q2 of last year and that was in North America and so that really drove the year-over-year softness on total revenue for the U.S.
Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Company
And the other question is can you guys talk a little bit about where we are with VoLTE? Youâre now hearing AT&T, T-Mobile, etcetera in Europe all moving that way. Can you give us an update on where you stand with the opportunities?
Michael Tessler
Sure, Catharine. Itâs Mike. I think the -- we continue to see kind of the similar rollout plans. I mean most of our activity in the VoLTE side is on the -- obviously as we talked about a number of times around business VoLTE, continue to work a number of those projects in North America and I think those are continuing on schedule and as weâve talked about previously. Iâd say that generally the rollout around the world, the rest of the world seems to be slow. We donât see a tremendous amount of push yet. We see little test activity going on here and there, but yet to see really major commitments to it. We are engaged in a number of business VoLTE projects in Europe that will probably play out in kind of 24 month timeframe.
Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Company
All right, thanks. And then, one more question on North America. Where did you guys stand on Tier 2 and Tier 3 opportunities versus Tier 1?
Michael Tessler
Yes, so Q1 was a really good Tier 2 quarter. Q2 Tier 2 was a little softer, it was fine. And the slack was picked up on what weâd call the strategic side or strategic accounts.
Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Company
All right. Thanks. I will move on.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company
Thank you. Jim, as it relates to the enterprise VoLTE projects youâre working on, can you give us any color on what these services are going to look like, how theyâre going to differ from the consumer services and how theyâre going to take advantage of your guys technology?
Michael Tessler
Richard, I will take that. Itâs Mike. I think the way to look at the business VoLTE opportunity is, if you kind of take a small business, let me use a concrete example, take a small business today that would have a fixed infrastructure, high speed broadband router, switching, etcetera serving 25 employees. What weâre starting to work with and weâre starting to see the operators looking to plan is offers that would be completely wireless. So basically moving the LAN infrastructure into the network, into the RAN of the radio network, moving all your devices to being wireless devices, those devices may in fact look and feel like good old hard phones, except the uplink is not physical, itâs wireless and really kind of radically simplifying the deployment of unified communications to small and medium businesses and also radically reducing the cost and complexity for those businesses. So no longer do I need a LAN and a switching and all the technology I would normally need. Iâm basically outsourcing my LAN WAN in unified communications to the operator. So thatâs the major functionality that you will see when people launch business VoLTE capabilities obviously from the voice and video and instant messaging capabilities it would be a full unified communications capability, even though we call it VoLTE, Voice over LTE, it will really would be UC and unified comms over LTE is a better way to imagine what that services will look like.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company
So just to be clear, they wouldnât be using Wi-Fi, they would be using actually the cellular service as their wired infrastructure or wireless infrastructure?
Michael Tessler
Richard, thatâs a good point. I mean, again you will see a mix of all the solutions. Iâm not saying everybody is going to go away from wired, physical IP and Cat5. You will see a mixture of that. You will see some small businesses are going Wi-Fi on the prem and then you will see others going fully, if you like, into the radio network or they may have no infrastructure on premise. So I think there is going to be kind of a number of potential rollouts to the small business segment. I do think that itâs kind of a personal belief that if I was running a small business and I could outsource my LAN and broadband and protecting that network into the radio network, into the carrier network, that would seem to be a pretty interesting opportunity, pretty interesting way to save money and complexity. So it will be -- we will have to see how that rolls out as people start planning for these small business over LTE rollouts.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company
Great, thanks. Just one more on the non-UC parts of the business, SIP trunking and consumer. Wondering if you can give any color on your expectations for them for the entire year? And I think you had talked about consumer being in kind of the 5% range for the year and just wanted to make sure that was still what you were thinking. Thanks.
James A. Tholen
Yes, I think consumer will be in that 5% SIP code, I think there is a lot of upside there. Trunking will be growth year-over-year. We had a really good Q1. It was a little light in Q2, but I think we will have a growth year-over-year.
Richard Valera - Needham & Company
Okay. Thanks, Jim
Operator
Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Thank you very much. Just on the couple of opportunities you mentioned. First of all, is the large incumbent service provider for wireline only or also for mobile?
Michael Tessler
Its both. The initial rollout will be for -- will be primarily on the fixed side. And the reason I say that is that the initial rollout will actually be -- will encompass new customers, but also will include some transformation of the existing customer base thatâs currently being served by TDM. So there will be a little bit of both and thatâs the first rollout then additive to that will be a VoLTE kind of FMC rollout kind of in Phase 2. So thatâs the rollout plan today for that opportunity.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Okay, so that is a new VoLTE win for you guys?
Michael Tessler
Yes, I guess Simona is so focused on the Phase 1, didnât realize, thatâs true. Thatâs true.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
And is that what accounts for the $6 million increase in deferred or were there other components in there?
James A. Tholen
So that really was the delta on the long-term deferred.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Okay. And then on the cable win, which I think you said was about $3 million, did that go into deferred for the short-term or is that going to run through as book, ship, and bill business?
James A. Tholen
Itâs a bit of both that we -- the $3 million was the full contract value. The software value which was -- letâs call it half of that is in deferred.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Okay. And then what percent in the quarter came from new customers versus existing customers?
James A. Tholen
Its actually for revenue, it was mostly new customers. I mean, mostly existing customers.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
I was going to be quite impressed.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
James A. Tholen
And so the -- yes it was basically not 90/10 on a sales activity basis existing versus new.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Great. And then just last question. I think you mentioned a monthly user number. Can you just repeat that and also is that a number that you provide regularly or just some other metric of sell-through that we can track?
James A. Tholen
Yes, actually what we provided Simona was the total BroadCloud PBX endpoint number. We said it was north of 100,000 which we thought was quite a significant milestone. I think our thought is on those specific numbers to do that more annually than quarterly, but we thought 100,000 from zero two years ago was a pretty cool number.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
And anything on BroadWorks you can provide as a similar metric or is the recurring sell-through metric?
James A. Tholen
So again, I guess, two comments. One at the Analyst Day, we did mention that there are 9 million BroadWorks endpoints for unified communications, which again we thought was a pretty profound number. And from a sell-through standpoint, our plan is to be qualitative quarterly and then like we did at the Analyst Day, much more specific on an annual trend basis and the qualitative is Q2 was a very nice sell-through quarter for unified communications.
Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.
Tavis McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
If UC-One is by definition a licensed or hosted product or do you give the carrier the option to deploying in either fashion? And then on your hosted business, that is the direct to [ph] [sale] business that you inherited, are you actively transitioning customers away from that, so we should expect those types of sequential declines going forward or was this something unique that happened in this quarter? Thanks.
James A. Tholen
Yes so -- no, I think there is a bit of a trend there at all. I think as a proportion of cloud that will diminish, itâs not growing arguably its declining a little bit. And itâs just not a business, itâs a direct to enterprise business that weâre pursuing or actively really kind of transition it. So you will -- certainly on a proportional basis that will be less and less of our overall SaaS number.
Michael Tessler
Let me take the first part of the question. UC-One is really the service offering and as weâve described before the service provider really has the option to deploy using our traditional software means and that means they integrate that software in their network and build the full end-to-end business process around our software or they can deploy using our BroadCloud infrastructure and leverage that for quicker time to market. And then they clearly have the optionality to go from cloud back to software as some of the carriers who are leveraging cloud have indicated they would like to do. So really we kind of make either of those options available to the carrier and in some cases it will be kind of a single strategic choice the carrier might make. The carrier may also make a choice of saying depending on segment, some segments may go cloud. Some segments may go software. So, weâre seeing all those variations in our dialogue with our customers.
Tavis McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And on the North American carrier where you just indicated theyâre shipping some TDM customers over to your platform. Is that an opportunity at a lot of large carriers, are there still a decent amount of traditional Centrex customer base eventually these carriers will have to transition over to IP?
Michael Tessler
So, just to clarify the comment I made a few minutes ago was on the strategic win we announced in the script which is an international carrier not a domestic carrier. And it is a transition of some TDM services from their legacy circuits which network to the IP network. So we do also believe that there is, to your point, there is also broader opportunities as carriers start to roll out more IP and more unified communications. We may see more drive towards not only just acquiring new customers, using hosted unified communications, but a choice to start to migrate some of the legacy base from circuit switched to IP. And there is still, I wouldnât say huge numbers but there is still a fair number of subscribers that are using legacy TDM Centrex.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Yes. Hi, can you guys hear me?
Michael Tessler
Yes, Dmitry.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Okay, thank you. So, as I joined, I missed your opening remarks, I apologize if these questions or these items have been addressed. But I wanted to get a couple of quick ones here. First on the $50 million customer that youâre recognizing revenue each quarter this year, what was the contribution from that customer? And also on the BroadCloud what was the contribution of BroadCloud?
James A. Tholen
Yes, so the -- so its $4.5 million from the -- and it was a 10% customer in the quarter. And then it was $5.7 million of BroadCloud revenue in the quarter.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Great, thanks Jim. And then how do we think about your margins going forward into Q3, Q4? Your overall margin was flat I believe as I look at the numbers here on the quarterly basis. Clearly it sounds like subscription has gone down this quarter. How do we think about that margin going into Q3, is it increasing, staying about the same, license I think also if you could comment on that, that would be helpful and also on the professional service if you could break those three down that would be great.
James A. Tholen
Sure. I think second half gross margins with be up. We still have a goal for the year of overall 80% gross margins. Q3 will be approximately where we are this quarter plus or minus depending on where we come in on revenue obviously in the middle term much of what's in cost of sales is flat or is fixed and so that will -- depending on where we come in, in Q3. In the remarks Dmitry, we talked a little bit about what pulled down gross margins in the quarter with gross margin on subscription and there were some one-time things in the subscription revenue that caused a little bit of a decline in Q2. And my expectation is that weâll continue to see increasing margins in the SaaS business for the second half of the year.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Okay, thanks Jim. And if I may also, on this acquisition of SDD, how many people are coming onboard and how to think about the R&D ramp sort of or maybe even sales marketing ramp into Q3, Q4, can you help us understand that? Thank you.
James A. Tholen
Yes, its headcount a little north of 30 people. It will be incremental R&D headcount, but I think it will, the numbers are not â will not be noticeable externally. The investment is really around integrating -- further integrating the JAZZ Fusion SaaS offering with our software and cloud offerings.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Okay, great. And then last one for Mike, just I didnât want to leave Mike out. On the BT announcement from one of your over the top competitors out there I think they won that BT business or at least they have an offering there. Are there couple of others in that same category that theyâre competing with or trying to offer soft of a -- it seems like a Chinese menu of items for their customers. Can you help us Mike understand the differences between that part of the BT business offerings and where you play which is I think BT wholesale. If you could separate the two and give us a sense of how strategic maybe each one of these segments are to BT or to you that would be great. Thank you.
Michael Tessler
Right. So, I think as you commented Dmitry, I think the carriers like to have a little bit of a portfolio effect with different solutions across the portfolio and generally Iâm not going to comment specifically on them at BT and where, let BT talk about that. But I think generally we see the ring central guys focused in the kind of sub (indiscernible) marketplace when engaging with the carrier side of the community. So, theyâre very much at the low end. Our relationship with BT, weâve, obviously as existing customer of ours we have been selected as a strategic supplier to BT group. You mentioned the piece that we already announced which was around BT wholesale, which we announced back in February and weâre working with a number of other groups, in other projects, in other market launches and I suggest that you guys stay tuned to hear about those, and then the full picture will emerge over time.
Dmitry Netis - William Blair & Company
Okay. Thank you gentlemen. Keep up the good work.

The next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities
Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to follow-up on the last question about the gross margin and try to better understand some of the specific one-time impacts that did hit the subscription margins in the period to what degree pricing may have played a role on BroadCloud, and what's giving you confidence these one-time items won't persist beyond the current quarter?
James A. Tholen
Yes, Jess the pricing really wasnât an issue on the gross margin side. And I mean, look, it was a combination, but the one-time really are one-time, and itâs not a huge cost of sales number. So some stuff flowing through impacts the gross margin point. The other bit of the spending was just, we are -- and you saw the CapEx number for the quarter was reasonably healthy. So we are seeing growth in the depreciation cost expense which will continue, but the one-time really were just in the quarter.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities
So would the expectation be that the subscription and maintenance gross margin would be back in the 70% range in Q3?
James A. Tholen
Bare with me for a second. Yes, it will -- I think it will -- yes, it will be there or close.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities
And then maybe just following up on the earlier question on the outlook for the year. I assume you hit the high end of your Q3 earnings outlook, it seems like youâd have to have a very strong Q4 just to get to the low end of your earnings target for the year especially given the dilution from the SSD deal. So I was hoping to understand what's giving you confidence the midpoint or high end of the range are still in play here, if we should be modeling full-year EPS closer to the low end?
James A. Tholen
Yes, look -- I mean, Jess, your guidance I think we feel good about the range; Q4s are typically quite profitable for us. Again, most of our costs in the mid term are pretty fixed. So, I think we feel pretty solid about the guidance.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities
All right guys, thanks. Keep up the good work.
James A. Tholen
Thank you.

The next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
Couple of questionâs if I may. First off, Jim, I trust that you guys are religiously tracking your win rate, so two related questions. What is that win rate, and how many opportunities are you looking at right now that haven't been awarded that are up for grabs that you may or may not win? And then Iâve got a follow-up.
James A. Tholen
I will tell you, we win way more than our unfair share. And itâs fairly rare that we lose a unified communications deal to a service provider. So, the win rate is really pretty high. And Iâd say weâve a healthy pipeline of new opportunities both new and as Mike said on the strategic deal we win at kind of a group level or home country level these large international incumbents and then youâre the preferred supplier as you work through their operating entities in other countries and those are really all new wins for us and so, again the pipeline there is healthy.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
Jim, I apologize but can you translate that for us. Are the opportunities measured in single-digits or are they measured in double-digits? What are we talking about?
James A. Tholen
I mean the biggest ones are lifetime values are clearly double-digit millions. Youâre talking about number of opportunities?
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
I'm talking about the number of opportunities, not the dollar value. That was going to be the next question, but I'm talking about the number of opportunities.
Michael Tessler
I mean, yes, double-digit. Yes.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
Double-digits and so Mike, to your question, what would that constitute in terms of total perspective opportunity?
Michael Tessler
I mean its very hard to answer your question Paul, I mean depending on the size of the operator is really the size of the channel available to us winning a Tier 3 operator versus winning a global multi-OpCo group is huge life on value difference, one it could be in the single millions and one could be in the hundreds of millions. So, itâs really hard to put a finger on that. I mean weâve always talked at, we run a very large portfolio of opportunities from new markets, new customers in existing markets, new segments in existing operators that generates 100s of opportunities that weâre pursuing in any one time. Some maybe small and some maybe very large life time value opportunities that weâre pursuing. So, I think the range is so dynamic. Itâs hard to come up with a number -- single number for you.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
Fair enough. It sounds like not to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there is still significant opportunity measured both in terms of the number of opportunities and the dollar amount. But thatâs the setup for the next question which really goes back to the series of questions Simona was asking which I really think was going to visibility. If we looked at your current customer base, the revenues that they generate quarter in, quarter out and Jim, I understand from your commentary that you really don't want to get quantify it for us on a quarterly basis although that would be nice. So the, question if you won't quantify it, from a qualitative perspective, that run rate business putting aside if one wanted to take a very bearish point of view and assume you never won another piece of business again, your current customer base -- what been the growth -- what does that look like generically -- how would you characterize visibility today versus 90 days ago, 180 days ago, etc. whatever frame of reference you want to provide us?
Michael Tessler
So, Paul I would characterize the UC growth of our existing customers as healthy, strong. The sell through data that we shared at the analyst day showed sell through for year-over-year percentage growth in the 30âs and thatâs really in a lot of ways an existing customer measure, and I will tell you that Q2 was a really healthy sell through month. So, clearly the market dynamics for you see they are very positive for us. We are the predominant supplier into what we think will be the predominant supplier or predominant seller of UC services worldwide, the service providers. We donât see our position competitively selling into the service providers, worsening -- lessening in fact, its interesting some of the large PBX vendors that you guys were all concerned about a year ago, weâre not getting a lot of questions on those guys right now, and because I think again weâre beating them selling into the carriers. So, thatâs all to us quite bullish on our business.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
All right. And I will apologize to you and everybody else on the call, but one last question. The volatility -- the ongoing volatility weâre seeing from quarter-to-quarter, can you just remind us what that is a function of? What swings the numbers around? Is that the deferred revenue issue or is it just rev rec? What are the issues that are creating that significant volatility from quarter-to-quarter?
Michael Tessler
I think we sell large chunky software to material buyers. I mean weâre selling into telecom. I think its really not just rev rec, rev rec does swing it around. But Q4âs are very strong. Q1âs thereâs usually an overhang coming from Q4, and the Telcoâs havenât gotten their budgets approved. Q2âs tend to be pretty good. Q3âs are a mix because sometimes youâll get good order flow and sometimes you just can't totally transact the business in Europe. So, I think thatâs clearly a pattern for us.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company
Got it. Thank you. I will pass (indiscernible).

Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital.
Mike Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
How many Tier 1 service provider customers do you have for BroadCloud at this point?
James A. Tholen
I donât think weâve released that publicly. Obviously we have noted Verizon in the U.S. is our flagship North American customer in BT in Europe for Europe. And we continue to sign Tier 1âs on BroadCloud.
Mike Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Do any of those have contract renewals up in the next 12 months, let's say?
James A. Tholen
Sure. Yes, I mean most of them are --- I mean thereâs some level of auto renew, they can be anywhere from 12 to 36 months initial terms.
Mike Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Got it. And professional serviceâs is growing fairly rapidly. Is some of that tied to the cloud business as well?
James A. Tholen
Relatively small, itâs actually these larger projects that weâve been referring to that are more software oriented. There is some professional services with cloud, but itâs relatively modest. But certainly on a billings basis and a revenue basis, the large deal thatâs rolling through the income statement this year would definitely growth in PS and then couple of the other large software deals that are in deferred also, there was some -- we hit invoice milestones, we were able to invoice and you saw that going into deferred.
Mike Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Okay. And then SIP trunking this year, is this growing a little slower than it did last year? And if so, kind of whatâs going on in the environment, if thatâs the case?
James A. Tholen
Yes, the rate of growth is probably down just a little, but itâs relatively consistent. We had a pretty large trunk in Q4, so I think its just more carriers working through some or Q4 and Q1 just some license inventory but I think the overall SIP trunking market continues to be robust for us.
Mike Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Sure. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Matthew Hoffman with Mizuho.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
Okay. I want to build on Rich's earlier question on VoLTE in the small and medium business. I was hoping specifically if you could outline how you see BroadSoft's products differentiated from the more consumer oriented VoLTE solutions out there from say Ericsson, Mavenir and others. You see it on the delivery pricing features? What is it that will separate your offerings in those 25 employee niche that you are talking about? Thanks.
Michael Tessler
Right. So, I mean primarily itâs a fair amount of feature functionality. The capability is to support the business environment across the full unified communication stack. Almost all the consumer VoLTE rollouts basically are kind of substitution of voice offer is really moving mobile subscribers from their legacy infrastructure to Voice over LTE, very little focus on kind of feature functionality. So, the big difference is all the group level function, the enterprise class voice features, the various modes of messaging, text messaging, collaboration, video, all those capabilities that we include in our unified communications separates our solution pretty dramatically from the consumer Voice over LTE providers. And I think the gap is pretty large to -- that gap is a pretty large gap to close. Lots of IP that we have in terms of delivery of these advance feature functionalities on IMS core networkâs that really no one else has been able to kind of really gain that experience as weâve been doing that for almost 10 years in the IMS network world.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
Got it. And just a quick housekeeper for, Jim. The CapEx guide, I think you said it was $3.5 million. Was that an annual or 2H number? Thanks.
James A. Tholen
Second half. $3 million to $3.5 million, second half.
Matthew Hoffman - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
Great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank
Vijay, calling on behalf of Brian Modoff. Two questions, if I may. The first question is, help us understand the interactions between the underlying Voice over LTE service and the feature sets and capabilities you provide. I think here is where Iâm coming from. Would you have anything in your feature portfolio that would be uniquely enabled by Voice over LTE or would it just be a set of features and services that happen to ride on the top of VoLTE? Help us understand what you offer interacts with VoLTE? Thanks.
Michael Tessler
Yes, I think I mentioned before. I think we look at the access technology as a kind of -- let me -- there will be variety of access technologies that service providers and enterprises will utilize from fixed broadband to which will include things like MPLS, to access to lager enterprises, to Wi-Fi, to LTE. And we look to provide that unified communications, feature functionality ubiquitous across all of those. So, weâre not really looking to drive if you like specific additional features out of the deployments on the LTE. I think the requirements for an LTE deployment obviously is inter-op and integrate with those LTE infrastructures which are, can be different than the other infrastructures. Thereâs the interoperability integration with the mobile handsets, thatâs again different than integrating with an IP handset. And so, there is different delivery requirements and skills and knowledge and expertise that we have around delivering on those IMS core mobile networks. But from a feature functionality delivery standpoint, weâre looking for ubiquitous feature functionality across any of those access delivery technologies.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank
Okay, thank you. And then a quick follow-up in terms of competition. Any thoughtâs heading into the back half of the competitive dynamics playing out versus Cisco on the hosted side and also versus Microsoft on the on-premises side? Thanks.
Michael Tessler
Yes, I would say that the competitive picture hasnât changed very much. We continue to see I think Cisco being focused in the carrier channel at the high end. Thatâs where they have been for a number of years with HCS product offering. We have not seen a tremendous amount of success in rolling that technology out through the carriers for a number of reasons, price, complexity, scaling issues, integration to the network. Obviously youâre taking a PBX and now trying to integrate with carrier network technologies like I just mentioned, IMS and LTE which are pretty foreign to the HCS solution. So, weâre seeing very, very small success in that segment and we are seeing a number of operators looking at expanding our market offers from small to medium to actually overlapping with that large enterprise segment. So, I think on that front, I think pretty positive -- continued positive step in the carrier side competitively. Microsoft continues to obviously focus primarily on the premise side with Lync. I think we see a fairly good rollout of Lync on the, let me call IT side of the house around email and IM and things like SharePoint et cetera, all the functionality and I recall more IT centric very few companies really adopting the Microsoft technology for their real time communication aspects, voice video, text messaging and audio conferencing and video conferencing. So, I think weâre still seeing a focus on the Microsoft products really as an upgrade on the IT side, not so much on the voice and video side.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank
Thank you.

And Iâm not showing any further question at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our host.
