Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IMS Health First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, April 24, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Markwick, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Andrew Markwick
Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss IMS Health's First quarter 2015 performance.
With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Financial Planning and Analysis and Investor Relations. Ron Bruehlman apologizes that he can't attend today due to passing of his mother.
Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on our Events and Presentation section of our Investor Relations website. The Investor Relations website is easily found in the top right-hand corner of our website, imshealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, April 24, 2015.
Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are in fact achieved would depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company.
Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
During this presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and unlevered free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.
These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
Now I will turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Andrew, and good morning everyone. I would like to thank you all for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. We came out of 2014 with strong momentum and I am pleased to report we continued this momentum as we moved into 2015.
Our constant currency revenue growth was 7% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the revenue growth rate was about 6%. We continued to drive margin expansion in the quarter with solid profit performance. Adjusted EBITDA grew 9.8% in the quarter, again, constant currency.
Tech services had another great quarter with 12.7% growth on constant currency, which included continued strong performance in a real world evidence and technology and applications. Information offerings grew 3% at constant currency. Emerging markets revenue increased 11.2% and developed markets grew 6.1% before the impact of FX.
As you know, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter against our basket of foreign currencies, increasing the headwind against the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. Tom will walk you through the impact of this currency headwind in a fair amount of detail on our reported results.
During the quarter, we gained traction with new technology deals as clients continued to see the compelling value of IMS One and of our Nexxus suite of applications. As an example, we signed up another mid-sized client for our broad Nexxus suite. That deal included master data management, CRM and performance applications.
We also continue to expand our footprint at existing IMS, Nexxus user clients. In Q1, the three current [ph] Nexxus clients expanded the usage of the Nexxus application suite to support additional geographies and new product launches, thus adding more licenses for CRM marketing and incentive comp. In addition to our momentum in tech and apps, we continue to see good traction with our real world evidence offerings.
In Q1, three [ph] top-15 pharma companies expanded their RWE platform capabilities with us. What is driving this growth in real world evidence is increasing requirement for our customers to prove to physicians and payers the effectiveness of their treatments in the real world settings.
By combining our unique anonymous patient assets with our proprietary technology, we increased the speed with which clients access real world data and we provide powerful insights to support the placement and pricing of their products.
Now, as we reported recently, we just closed the acquisition of Cegedim and strategic data business. With the closing of this acquisition behind us, we have started the complex task of executing our integration plans. This integration will take time to complete.
In 2015, we are going to be focusing on the heavy lifting for this acquisition and there will be much effort and investment around the world to lean out our combined operations. As a result, you already know not to expect any upside in 2015.
Furthermore, since we only have a partial year and lots of accounting reconciliations to go through, I am sure you know to expect some level of complexity in our financial reporting for the balance of the year.
Now, I know our finance function will do its best to provide reconciliations along the way. Let me say that we are looking forward to advancing this important role this year and we expect significant synergies to kick in beginning in 2016, as we had previously anticipated.
Let me elaborate on our immediate area of focus. First, we will be bringing the Cegedim and IMS sales teams together to make it easier for clients to engage with us and to better present our combined capabilities.
Second, Cegedim's mobile intelligence offering has made a major player in the CRM space for life sciences. We intend to play and we intend to win. We are focusing on linking MI with our Nexxus applications to provide clients an integrated solution for running their commercial operations.
The one key database of $14 million healthcare professionals around the world is the global gold standard and it has enhanced our industry-leading information offerings. One key will be integrated into IMS One, our unique cloud platform, providing access to the world's largest and most complete healthcare reference database through the Nexxus application suite.
Third, we are leveraging the tremendous technical resources of Cegedim to help advance our overall technology services' growth strategy. Once again, we are excited about welcoming our associates to IMS, and we look forward to [ph] the many opportunities the combined companies bring to our client base.
Now I would like to turn it over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, FP&A and Investor Relations, to take you through the first quarter financials in more detail. As Andrew mentioned, Ron is unfortunately unable to be with us today due to passing of his mom the day before yesterday. Tom?
Tom Kinsley
Thank you, Ari. Good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, we had another strong quarter of operating performance as evidenced by the constant currency growth rates, he highlighted. Of course, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against our basket of foreign currencies continues to impact our reported results. I will discuss both, constant currency and actual currency results in my remarks and I will talk later about the impact of currency on the balance of the year.
Revenue in the first quarter increased 7% on a constant currency basis. This growth was again driven by our technology services offerings, which increased 12.7%, with particular strength in our real-world evidence and tech and apps offerings.
Information revenue was up 3% constant currency, driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets. Revenue declined 2%, due to the impact of currency. The strengthening of the dollar versus the euro was responsible for over half of the FX impact, with smaller impacts in numerous other countries.
Technology services revenue grew at 5.3% on a reported basis, while information revenue declined an even 7% on the same basis.
On a geographic basis, develop markets grew 6.1% and emerging markets 11.2% at constant currency. On a reported basis, developed markets declined to 1.8% and emerging markets 2.9%.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $216 million, up 9.8% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined half a point.
For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA margin grew 87 basis points at constant currency. Margins expanded despite the dilutive impact from higher revenue growth in technology services as we executed against to our cost reduction initiatives, including tightly controlling overhead expenses and moving work to our low-cost centers of excellence overseas. On a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA margin grew 49 basis points to 34.2%.
Moving down the P&L, GAAP net income was $298 million during the quarter compared with the net loss of $24 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Now, there were a number of unusual items in both years that impacted this comparison. By far, the largest impact related to taxes, because during the first quarter of 2015, we asserted that all of our non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.
This resulting in a $256 million non-cash income tax benefit from a one-time reduction in the deferred tax liability as we no longer expect to pay the higher U.S. taxes that we previously accrued on our non-U.S. earnings, so going forward we will not be required to accrue to the higher U.S. tax rate on our non-U.S. earnings. Consequently, we expect our effective book tax rate to be in the high 20% going forward.
The change in assertion though does not impact our cash tax rate, which as we have already previously told you should remain in the high teens as a percentage of adjusted pre-tax income and that is all the way through 2018.
As you may recall, we had unusually high equity compensation expense in the first quarter of 2014 that related to our IPO. Equity compensation expense in this year's first quarter was more in line with what we would expect in a normal quarter.
Depreciation and amortization associated with purchase accounting declined $14 million in the first quarter of 2015 as the intangible assets assigned five-year lives at the time of the LBO are now fully amortized.
The full year 2015 impact for this will be $140 million. Included in the first quarter 2015 net income is a $7 million pre-tax charge for a further revaluation of our Venezuelan Bolivar monetary assets and liabilities. The Venezuelan government eliminated
The Venezuelan government eliminated the SICAD II exchange rate of approximately 50 bolivars to the dollar that we have used since June 30th of last year. The new applicable rate is 193 bolivars to the dollar. Therefore, at the end of the first quarter, we re-measured our Venezuelan bolivar monetary assets and liabilities at the new rate of 193 bolivars to the dollar.
For context, remember we took charge in the second quarter last year when we moved from 6.3 bolivars to the dollar to 50 bolivars to the dollar and now we are moving to 193 bolivars to the dollar.
Okay. That's it for net income.
Now, the GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.86 in the first quarter compared with the diluted loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year.
Adjusted net income in the first quarter was $136 million compared to $70 million in the prior year, primarily the result of lower interest expense. Adjusted net income also included a $7 million benefit from foreign royalty hedges and another $1 million benefit on the natural edge provided by the interest expense on our euro-denominated term loans.
Adjusted net income also benefited from unusually low cash taxes this quarter. Cash taxes were $13 million lower than last year. About $10 million this improvement was timing-related and will be paid in the second quarter. Consequently, while the cash tax rate was only 11% in the first quarter, we expect the full year cash tax rate to normalize to the high-teens.
As a reminder, since adjusted net income includes cash taxes rather than book taxes, the $256 million benefit I previously mentioned did not contribute to any of the growth in our adjusted net income. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.39 in the quarter compared with $0.24 in 2014, reflecting the increase in adjusted net income I just explained, partially offset by higher share count.
Average fully diluted shares outstanding increased from $288 million in the first quarter of 2014 to $345 million in this year's first quarter, mainly due to the issuance of new shares at the time of our IPO. FX had a negative impact of $0.02 per share versus the prior year.
Now, moving to the balance sheet, although we closed the acquisition of Cegedim CRM and strategic data businesses in the second quarter, the debt required to fund this transaction was issued in the first quarter, which increased our cash and debt balances at the end of the first quarter.
We issued â¬275 million of senior notes, with the balance of the transaction and related fees funded with cash from the balance sheet. These eight-year notes carry a nice fixed rate 4% and an 8% interest. Issuing euro-denominated notes was attractive, because rates are currently favorable on euro debt, and because the interest payments act as a natural hedge against our euro earnings, this debt issuance was considered in the earnings guidance we provided last quarter.
At March 30, 2015 cash and cash equivalents totaled $639 million and debt was $4 billion, resulting in net debt of $3.3 billion. Our gross leverage ratio increased to 4.5 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA compared to 4.3 times at year end 2014.
As we begin to include adjusted EBITDA contribution of the acquisition, the ratio will decline. On a pro forma basis that is including 12 months of Cegedim earnings, our March 31, 2015 gross leverage ratio would have been 4.2 times, down from 4.3 times at year end 2014. Finally, as we realize projected synergies, the acquisition should actually further reduce our gross leverage ratio.
Cash flow from operations increased by $133 million to $30 million during the first quarter compared to net cash used of the $103 million in the first quarter of last year. Our unlevered free cash flow grew $57 million or 27% of adjusted EBITDA versus negative 11 million in last year's first quarter.
As we previously discussed, the first quarter is our lowest quarter for unlevered free cash flow as we pay our annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of each year. You will recall that last year's first quarter also included about $26 million of capital expenditures for the purchase of a building in Bangalore, to house our global delivery center.
Now let us take a minute to discuss the acquisition as we ourselves are learning more and more about the business.
First, let's talk about the phasing of the quarters. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA of the acquired Cegedim businesses have historically had seasonality and therefore cannot be projected ratably over the course of the year. As a result, and because we closed the deal after the first quarter was over, we are providing you with Cegedim's historical quarterly revenue and EBITDA phasing. We are only providing the data for Q2, Q3 and Q4 at this stage to help you better phase the post-acquisition financials in 2015. You will note from the slide that this seasonality is weighted more heavily towards the end of the year, primarily due to a greater volume of delivery in the fourth quarter versus other quarters.
Second, our guidance for Cegedim includes some downward adjustments for few items, such as translation of IFRS financials to U.S. GAAP, some incremental operating costs associated with the integration, the likely termination of a small business activity as well as and more importantly to factor in the impact of foreign exchange on Cegedim's results as it is also a global business covering more than 70 countries.
Before we move to guidance, let's take a minute to discuss FX. As you are aware and as depicted on the chart, the euro and the Japanese yen significantly weakened against the U.S. since the beginning of last year and these two currencies have the largest impact on IMS reported results. It is astonishing to see the euro and yen weakened 20% and 15%, respectively against the dollar in the last 15 months.
You can see from the chart that the totality of the decline has happened over the last nine months. In fact, almost 60% of the 20% euro decline occurred in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, and assuming rates remain unchanged through the end of the second quarter, the impact of FX in the second quarter will be at least as dramatic and likely even more severe than in the first quarter.
Now, of course, these compares should significantly improve in the second half of the year, assuming once again rates remain as they or potentially become more favorable.
Now, we do not normally provide quarterly guidance. However, given that we are bringing in Cegedim this quarter and given the sizable impact of FX, we realize that you need more visibility and therefore we will make an exception this time and give you more color on what we see for the second quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
On a constant currency basis, we expect second quarter revenue growth of 25% to 26% for the combined business. On a reported basis, we need to consider a number of factors that impact second quarter growth. First, as you saw in the previous chart, the dollar strengthened entirely in the second half of 2014, against our key currencies and with respect to the euro, largely in the first quarter of this year.
Second, we had a tough second quarter compared, due to the combined effect of the Venezuelan bolivar revaluation that occurred at the end of the second quarter 2014 and the additional valuation we are taking in the first quarter of 2015, which I will remind you takes the second quarter compare from six bolivar to the dollar to 193 to the dollar.
Thirdly, Cegedim has a greater proportion of non-U.S. denominated revenue in the core IMS business. Therefore, assuming exchange rates remain constant for the remainder of the year, we expect the second quarter reported revenue to be 11% to 12%. Applying the same rationale, we expect the second quarter adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% to 9% on a constant currency basis, down 5% to 6% on a reported basis.
As a reminder, to help you interpret foreign-exchange movement, including the impact of the Cegedim acquisition, a hypothetical 1% change in the value of the dollar versus our basket of currencies would impact IMS revenue by $19 million to $20 million, a percentage point move versus the dollar in the value of the euro either upward or downward results in about an $8 million to $9 million impact on our reported full year revenue. For the yen, each point is worth about $3 million and for all other currencies combined; it is another $8 million.
Now, let's turn to the full year guidance. You will recognize this chart as it is the same one we showed you last quarter. The full year guidance on a constant currency basis for core IMS and IMS with the Cegedim acquisition are the same as we provided you last quarter, so we are reaffirming guidance for all key metrics on a constant currency basis.
Only two numbers on the guidance chart have changed and they are not bolded and in italics, once again they have change solely, because of FX. We now expect full year revenue growth for the combined business to be approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA growth to be approximately 4% on a reported basis. When I say approximately, I mean, it could move a half a point or so either way.
As you can see from the slide, there is about a 10-point drag from FX on full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA Just as a note, we are maintaining our full-year 2015 reported guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for the combined business as we are able to offset the FX impact on adjusted EBITDA, primarily due to hedges.
We expect our unlevered free cash flow for the combined company to be between 70% and 80% of adjusted EBITDA. Look, I apologize for the level of granularity I am just taking you through, but given the level of complexity from adding Cegedim in the second quarter and the significant FX moves, the Venezuelan bolivar and otherwise, we felt it appropriate to share how we see the second quarter and the full year shaping up.
Once again, as you saw and to summarize this call, we had a great quarter. We are very pleased to see the technology services offerings continue to gain traction and we are reaffirming all of our full-year guidance on a constant currency and reported basis with the exception of revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a reported basis and that is solely due to FX.
We are excited to welcome the talented team from Cegedim to IMS. We are intensely focused on executing a successful integration so their customers can begin benefiting from the full offerings and capabilities of our combined company. Once again, as Ari stressed, we expect to see strong synergy benefits from this acquisition beginning in 2016.
With that, I will ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik
Yes. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for all that detail actually. I appreciate that. The first question I had for Ari was, I was wondering if you could just help us understand the magnitude of all the sort of integration efforts you referred to for this year now that you have Cegedim, I guess, in your ownership and sort of how much of prep book was already done. I am just trying to understand like if there is some potential to get this done sooner or what stage you are in?
Ari Bousbib
Well, thanks, Manav. We are going to focus as the top priority this year in addition to our business as usual execution which as you know already included a very busy agenda.
Manav Patnaik
Correct.
Ari Bousbib
We are going as far as can be, but look we are absorbing, we are increasing our workforce from day one by 50%, right? This is almost 5,000 people that we are adding to our existing 10,500 or thereabouts, so it has not been easy effort. It is a lot of heavy lifting, how fast can we go, you are integrating all over the world. They are and 70 countries. We are in a 100; we have had obviously to reorganize.
We announced the reorganization even before the close of the acquisition. Two of my new direct reports come from Cegedim. We have a totally new organization in terms of business unit, in terms of functions, so a lot of movements and it is all people-driven, so bear in mind that when we start looking at - from day one, we are incurring as Tom mentioned, incremental operating costs on the run rate basis.
We did say that there would be efforts to make the combined little more efficient and inevitably there will be some restructuring and so on around the world, but that takes time. From day one and this is why the second quarter is going to be a little muddy. From day one, we actually be incurring incremental operating costs as we bring in people on our e-mail system, on our HR policies, on our additional licenses for a variety of whether it is SAP or other things, so we are actually incurring incremental operating cost, which is separate from the whatever charges we are going to incur as we proceed with the integration efforts, so that is why the second quarter is muddy and it takes time, right?
I mean, people are not leaving the company overnight. There are contracts, there are unions all over the world, so we need to deal with that and that is going to be a heavy effort and very intense effort over with the balance of 2015. Again, to answer your question very intensive effort involving everybody and that's very hard to do you even though we have the plans ready to address the second part of your question.
Manav Patnaik
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
We have a pretty good idea of where we want to come out. It is just a question of execution. Most people will tell you it takes two to three years to execute and we obviously have a lot shorter timeframe than that and I did say we expect synergies to begin kicking into '16 and I intend fully to deliver on that commitment, but it takes a lot of work and that is why '15 is going to be a little tough on all of us.
Then secondly, we have product integration issues, you have got the got-to-market strategies to harmonize a lot of work, but yes it is an important part - focusing on. Thank you, Manav.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. That's great. I think, I will leave it there. Thanks guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Steinerman
Good morning, Ari. I first want to verify the approximate organic growth of tech services. You said it was about a point overall, so I am thinking the 12.7% constant currency translates to a little bit more than 10% organic for tech services in the quarter. Is that about right?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. I mean, that I do not have the math in front of me, but yes, that is about right. I think as you know all of the acquisitions have been tech services.
Andrew Steinerman
Perfect.
Ari Bousbib
We had maybe very, very de minimis we did a small acquisition that was a data business in South Africa will impact our [ph] very, very small.
Andrew Steinerman
I got it.
Ari Bousbib
Totality of each of these is tech services.
Andrew Steinerman
I got it. Then when I think about the 12.7%, obviously, you call out tech and apps and world evidence being the strongest. If you could just give one comment or direction on each of the subset tech and apps were workforce analytics, real-world evidence and consulting just for the quarter how did that all come together to make the 12.7?
Ari Bousbib
Well, I mean, tech and apps was about that rates like to mid-double digits I would say in the 13-ish percent, 13% to 14% kind of rate. The workflow analytics was high single 9-ish, 10%, something like that. Real world, it was very strong. I made the point of emphasizing that was really more the upper teens about 20% or so.
Andrew Steinerman
Great.
Ari Bousbib
Yes, more than 20% actually. Consulting was a little bit strong this quarter, but again in the kind of not high single digits thereabouts.
Andrew Steinerman
Great. That is a lot of breadth. Thank you very much.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Andrew.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger
Hi. Thanks very much. Ari, if you look at year segment results at the gross profit level, it seems like information margins deteriorated from last year while technology got quite a bit better. Can you just talk about that the drivers that drove the divergence?
Ari Bousbib
Well, look, this is consistent with what we have \been saying all along, right? The tech services' margins were going to grow as we further expand and gained scale and that is simply, because the SaaS model lend itself to higher margin accretion, the more licenses, the more applications we sell, the more we penetrate the client base with new geographies, new product launches et, cetera. That is just going to be a natural expansion of our margins, plus we continue to reduce our cost and leverage the investments we made in our COEs around world and the scale effects again allow us to deliver those products at a lower cost.
On the data side, we also spoke about investments we were making in our panel just because information is the historical data business, does not mean that we are ignoring, right? We are also investing in information offerings. We intend to remain the gold standard. We spoke about for example making investment in specialty data.
I was hesitating to mention it, but we did win this quarter a very major customer, a top-10, pharma company which was in the U.S., which had historically been and when I say historically, I would say two decades been with our competitor in the U.S., on the information side and for the first time in really more than 20 years, they are now going to be entirely with us. That is not in the numbers. It is going to be probably kicking in towards the end of the year and more likely '16, but why did we win it is primarily because we made these big investments in new data acquisition and expanded the panel more.
Overall, our data cost have crept up a little bit. Apples-to-apples, they have gone down. If you go back a few years, thus we made new investments in specialty data to have better coverage, better granularity and to maintain once again our gold status, so I think it is starting to payoff and that is why you will see our data margins tighten up little bit.
We also grow in emerging market, but the second driver of our data cost increases and we continue to expand our coverage to make ourselves to maintain the relevance of our data offerings. We need to continue to invest and grow in emerging markets, where inflation is growing the fastest, so these are the two reasons why margins have a little bit compressed.
Again, as we grow information that as you know the beauty of the data business is that, as you grow every dollar of incremental growth on the data side really brings a lot of margin with it, so it is just an issue of cyclicality. We made the investments this quarter, in the first quarter and we intend to see growth in subsequent quarters.
John Kreger
That's very helpful. Thank you. Just one other macro question, it seems like your data actually suggest that your customer growth in terms of revenues is improving of late. As you think about their budgets for what you are selling into, are we still in a cost cutting mode as we have been over the last several years? Are you seeing signs that their budgets are starting to expand with a better top-line?
Ari Bousbib
Well, I mean, that the intuitive conclusion I am not seeing that so much. What has happened is, I think our client base has become a lot better at managing costs, and once you acquire that discipline, just because the growth is returning does not mean that you go back or at least you would hope that you would maintain that discipline. I think that is what we are seeing.
Having said that, because there are lot more product launches, they need to support those launches and so yes, there are - I would not say that the budgets are expanding, but there are new budgets to support those new job launches.
John Kreger
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Blake with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
Elizabeth Blake
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In the press release, you are highlighting deal spending of $26 million. Can you provide any details there?
Ari Bousbib
I am sorry. Can you repeat the question, what is $26 million?
Elizabeth Blake
In your cash flow statement you have $26 million of deal spending in the quarter. Can you provide some details on what that entailed?
Ari Bousbib
Well, was that spend on the acquisitions that is what it is?
Elizabeth Blake
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
Well, I think, I mentioned before we - ImpactRx, which is a company in South Africa. What else? Do we have more detail on this? That was it?
Tom Kinsley
That was primarily. I think, there was one other acquisition that we did.
Ari Bousbib
Yes. ImpactRx, there was a little bit of - that is the revenue associated with prior, yes. I think that most of it was this new acquisition that we did in South Africa data business. Maybe we can follow-up Andrew and Tom will follow up with you after the call.
I think there was maybe a remaining payment for Aileron, the company we bought. I think was it last year?
Tom Kinsley
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
I think that is it.
Elizabeth Blake
Okay. Sure. That would be great if we could follow-up offline. Then we saw you all at Conference [ph] last week. Do you have any broader takeaways from that meeting, maybe an update on your expansion into non-manufacture areas?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. This means, you are saying is it a conference on consumer, we did have a small presence. We are doubling in consumer apps, the healthcare, we put out a few - we have something called AppScript, which allows doctors to prescribe to patients an app. We catalog and inventorize literally tens of thousands of apps that are out there. A lot of people as you know were trying participate in this marketplace.
To be very frankly, there is a lot of investment in it, particular venture capital investment. Not a lot of revenue yet that is being derived, but because we are at the crest of the business, we are keeping abreast. We have technology that is best-in-class to do all of that and we want to stay current with the data that can actually be extracted from this patient applications, but other than that again I think it is still very early to derive major implications.
Just if I may, Elizabeth, just want to confirm and close out your first question, which is the $26 million final acquisition in the first quarter and apologize will increase of the back year is 100%. The acquisition of ImpactRx, which is a data business we bought in South Africa.
Elizabeth Blake
Okay. Great. That is helpful. Thank you very much.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Stockton
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, and this may just be a different way of asking what John did earlier on budgets. As we have kind of 2014 in the books, and specialty had a really strong year last year for the pharma industry overall, have you seen any change in behavior maybe specifically for those comps or I mean is there any color you can give us on what the marketplace looks like.
It seems like your info business saw a little bit of an acceleration during the quarter. I know it sounds like maybe that was more driven by what is going on outside the U.S. than in the U.S., but any color there?
Ari Bousbib
Correctly pointed out, the bulk of the group in the U.S. and other was European markets, a great - this trend to continue. Specialty is really where our investment is as I mentioned before on the data side. As we said many times before, the growth that we see in our current base in specialty will reflect itself in our business more in the real world evidence era.
This is why we have, I think as I said earlier more than 20% growth in the quarter. In a real world evidence, and by the way this is basically all 100% organic growth. That is because it is a more complex area of specialty with more complex channels.
The data is not, you know, just prescriptions. It is not a retail channel, infusion center specialized centers, it is deeper reach of information that are requires a lot of more customized analysis and a lot more technology to derive the type. For examples there is a lot more predictive analytics on this, because the samples sizes are much smaller we are talking about the variety of niche markets for the industry as opposed to large, as opposed in primary care.
Again, because of all those reasons, the bulk of the growth in the industry in the U.S and Western Europe is specialty. That we translate itself into more growth in our technology services business and specific in a real world evidence platforms less so on the info side. The growth you saw in info was drive, as Tom mentioned, by emerging markets.
Jamie Stockton
Okay. That is great. Then maybe just one follow-up, Tom, in the SG&A line was there some benefit from writing off the deferred tax liability or something else that would kept that number down this quarter?
Tom Kinsley
In the SG&A line, no. The deferred tax liability only impacted the deferred tax liability and the deferred tax expense. It had nothing to do with SG&A, so SG&A was SG&A for this quarter.
Jamie Stockton
If we back then - out of the SG&A line, this is a level that we should expect kind of for the core business obviously Cegedim. Can I have an uplift effect on it, but for the core business is the level that it is kind of sustainable?
Tom Kinsley
Yes. I mean there are certain things that are moving a little bit one way or another. It is not going to be steady state all the time, but is representative within a range and not outside the range.
Jamie Stockton
Okay. Thank you.
Tom Kinsley
Yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Toni Kaplan
Hi. Thanks. Just continuing on the specialty side where we are seeing a lot of growth, which competitors are you running up against there, when you are trying to sell the customers in that part of the business?
Ari Bousbib
Sorry. Tony I was - competitive in which area? Information, or tech specialty unit?
Toni Kaplan
Yes. When you are selling into the specialty, either in information or in tech sources?
Ari Bousbib
I do not want to mention, but they are small companies that are more just ''consulting type'' companies with more - they sell more expertise, people expertise rather than data and technology.
As you know, our focus when we changed the strategy of the company was to productionize what we sell to our clients as much can be. There is always a degree, especially in specialty as I just explained earlier, the degree of customization, but we want to do that from existing platforms that we have productionized and standardized, so we really do not see anyone who brings to this business the combination of anonymous [ph] patient database that we have, the breath of our data.
Bear in mind, even when you have competitors that do have access to data, A, it is not clear. It is actually ambiguous that they have right and I am thinking more of companies without mentioning any names that do work for payers for example that services payers, so they need the payers' data, their customers' data to perform certain services for them and as they utilize that data, they are counting that they have access to data and they can put together offerings that address these market needs. Once again, it is not clear that they actually have the right to use that data.
Number two, it is limited and partial data. We specifically choose the data for that purpose and we have the broadest by far sourcing efforts on a global basis, so our anonymous patient database I think it is over 500 million records and nobody comes close on a global basis.
Again, because of the data access and number two because of the technology capabilities, I think we are fairly very differentiated and our competitive in that space range the gamut from small consultancies-type boutiques, which offer highly technical people base expertise to people who provide other services particularly for payers, so they have access to claims databases in the course of performing the services and they want to leverage that to offer the type of services that are required in real world evidence.
Once again, this is limited data generating limited geographically and limited, because it is their clients and it is also limited in terms of their ability to use it.
Tom Kinsley
Okay. I think we have got time for one more question.
Ari Bousbib
Thanks, Toni.
Tom Kinsley
Thanks, Toni.

Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper, SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
Sandy Draper
Thank you very much for squeezing me in. My initial question and, Tom, if it makes sense to do this more offline, that is fine. As I just look at your constant dollar growth for the year and I appreciate the guidance for the second quarter, my simple math, if I take what you reported in the first quarter, what you are implying for second quarter, it looks to me like you actually have slower growth and lower numbers in the back half of the year?
I did know it is sort of counterintuitive to what you said about Cegedim being stronger in the back half of the year. I do not know if there is something going on there. Again, maybe I just did some quick math wrong, but I checked it and it looks like there is a little bit of a slowdown in the second half, back half of the year, which sort of surprised me?
Ari Bousbib
You mean on the core business or on the combined?
Sandy Draper
The combined, so if just take the total constant dollar revenue growth.
Ari Bousbib
Yes.
Sandy Draper
â¦and say, take the middle at 19.5%, back out the first quarter you just reported in your guidance, mid-point of your guidance, the constant dollar numbers are lower in the back half. I am just trying to understand what would drive that?
Tom Kinsley
Revenue growth in the first quarter was strong. We have, this is the issue of being a public company. March 31 is an arbitrary cutoff date, so if something happens on April 1 then it is not in the first quarter numbers and all of a sudden you end up with say 4% organic growth. Then if something that was supposed to happen in the second quarter, happened in the first quarter and now you are end up with 6% organic growth, so you have to look at the whole year. So, we are maintaining our guidance and I think what has happened is we had a few things that we expected to happen in the second quarter that happened in the first quarter, which explains the strong growth in the first quarter.
Now, are more things going to happen? Look, we have visibility on our business about two-thirds or 70% our revenue is basically booked in. That is the beauty of this business, but we still have to chase 30% to 35% of the business and there will be some variability quarter to quarter.
I would not derive any other - look, if we continue to be strong then maybe we will be higher, but I just thought I would not encourage you to bump up the numbers for the year. We are trying to maintain our guidance and we are being prudent. Given all the work that we have to do on the Cegedim integration, we are working this year, of course, but my horizon year is '16, '17, '18.
Sandy Draper
Great.
Ari Bousbib
That is the best answer I can give you.
Sandy Draper
That makes sense, so to maybe summarize there is nothing changing dramatically that would make you raise the guidance, but you certainly executed better in the first quarter and we will just see how the execution goes in future quarters, but the general outlook is the same as you started the year?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. Absolutely, that is right.
Sandy Draper
Okay.
Ari Bousbib
If you can get some reconciliations or conversation with Tom and Andrew, they would be happy to answer more detailed questions.
Sandy Draper
Okay. Great. That is helpful. If I could squeeze in one last follow-up and it is sort of tails onto what a lot of people have been asking. Ari, when you think about the winning and as you are growing a little bit better when I think about three broad categories, are you taking market share and taking away customers or is it areas where customers are buying stuff they were never using before or is that areas where they were trying to do it internally and they are now saying, you know what? IMS can do it more efficiently. Is there a way to think about, I am sure you are winning in each of categories, but any one of those particular categories a stronger area of where you are growing? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
First of all, those three categories overlaps somewhat and the absolute truth is, it is all three of the trends that you mentioned, right? We are gaining some market share. I just talked about even information we just won back very large a top-10 pharma company that we did not for the last two decades, so we are gaining market share over our competitors. By the way, the same is true on the tax services side. I mentioned every time, we have to win and we displace somebody.
Number two, there is technology applications available today that they were not there before, so a lot of manual analytical works that was done by our clients can now be automated using some of the applications we are bring to market. In some cases, we are competing with others and others we are bring a proprietary unique platform, but this is what is generating the growth.
Number three, yes, there are activities particularly in the workflow analytics that were historically performed in-house that increasingly pharma companies have been looking at outsourcing just because they do not consider to be a core to their business.
Again, since we had zero people in India, just three years ago and we have 2,000 people today, so they are all working for clients and this is what they are used to be done well by the clients themselves in-house. In other cases, by the competitors, so it is a little bit of the three trends you mentioned.
Sandy Draper
Great. Thanks very much.
Andrew Markwick
With that, I think we are out of time. Thank you for taking the time to join us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2015 earnings call. In the meantime, do not hesitate to contact myself and Tom with your follow-up questions. We will be available along with Reena Patel. Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask you please disconnect your lines.
