Good afternoon. My name is Kyle and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the TriQuint Semiconductor Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).
Thank you. Mr. Brown, you may begin your conference.
Grant A. Brown
Thank you, Kyle. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Iâm Grant Brown, Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Ralph Quinsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Steve Buhaly, our Chief Financial Officer.
During the call weâll make forward-looking statements about TriQuintâs business, our projected financial results, and our proposed merger with RFMD. Actual results could differ materially from our projections based on various risk factors, including those described in the press release we issued earlier today and our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All financial measures presented in todayâs call are on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures report tax on a cash basis and exclude equity compensation charges, entries associated with mergers and acquisitions, including expenses associated with the planned merger with RFMD, and other specifically identified non-routine items. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance understanding of our core operating performance. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is in our press release and in the Investors section of our website.
Iâll now turn the call over to Ralph to provide an overview of the quarter.
Ralph Quinsey
Thanks, Grant and good afternoon everyone. I am delighted to report TriQuintâs third quarter revenue was $272.1 million and earnings were $0.28 per share, both well above the high-end of our prior guidance.
Revenue grew 18% sequentially and 8% year-over-year with gross margins at 46.6%, an impressive 8.6% increase as compared to Q3 last year. In fact Q3 was a record quarter for revenue and profits and with strong demand in design win momentum in place, I anticipate Q4 will also be a record quarter. 
We have made considerable progress transitioning away from low margin and non-strategic foundry revenue while serving a growing demand for our higher value products. Our improved financial performance is a result of many years of fundamental technology investment and product development in growth markets for premium filters, advanced GaAs/GaN products, and highly integrated solutions. We achieved another record in Q3 with 55 new products released in the quarter. These investments have positioned us for sustainable and profitable growth supporting long-term growth markets such as the build out of the worldwide communications infrastructure, continued smartphone adoption, and the deployment of advanced electronics with critical defense applications. 
At the mid-point of our Q4 guidance, full year 2014 revenue will be up approximately 14%. Growth would be 28% disregarding the $100 million headwind caused by our exit from low margin and non-strategic foundry business. Additionally our strategic investments combined with solid operational excellence is expected to push gross margin performance through a 14 year high in 2014 with more margin upside and better than market growth anticipated in 2015. 
Regarding our pending merger with RFMD to for Qorvo, we received overwhelming shareholder support and expect to close once we complete final regulatory approvals prior to the end of the year. Our time since the February announcement has been used constructively with significant progress being made by integration teams to ensure we maintain momentum into a successful launch of the company while creating a platform for strong ongoing business results as a combined entity. 
Now looking more closely at our major markets and starting with infrastructure and defense, Q3 revenue was $86.9 million flat sequentially and up a healthy 24% compared to Q3 a year ago. The growth in IDP came from rock solid execution coupled with strong demand for base station products supporting the worldwide expansion of LTE primarily in China. 
With a diverse mix of revenue across a large number of customers and products our IDP business is built on some of the world's best technology as we continue to grow revenue through an ever expanding product portfolio including 130 new products launched this year. Not only do these long lifecycle products feed a fly wheel of accumulating revenue, they also pave the way for cross over revenue in adjacent markets. 
BAW is a clear example of a technology that today generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that had modest roots in the defense market. We believe GaN based products enabled by 10 years of investment are following a similar path with new opportunities now opening up in base station power and other commercial applications that require higher power, higher efficiency, and greater bandwidth. 
In the base station market Q3 revenue was $25.6 million up over 53% compared to Q3 of last year. The message in the base station market is consistent with last quarter as we continue to experience strong demand related to the worldwide 4G LTE build out. Over the course of the last 18 months, demand for our base station products has ramped to just north of $100 million a year. We expect to maintain this level through 2015 and likely well into 2016 as carriers continue to build out their networks worldwide. Including India for an estimated 1 billion loyal subscribers are eager to transition to LTE in broadband smartphone. 
Total revenue in our transport market was $25.4 million and looks to remain strong as we continue to win, continue accumulate key wins in next generation designs. Optical network products have been area of strength for TriQuint where revenues were up 86% over Q3 last year and up approximately 14% over 2013 on a year-to-date basis. 
As networks move from 40 gigabits to a 100 gigabits and beyond, higher bandwidth, lower power consumption, and smaller size will be required. All areas our products are differentiated as compared to our competition. Ultimately the transport market is driven by data traffic which continues to expand rapidly. Global monthly data traffic is expected to double from current levels by 2018 providing an encouraging bright spectrum for future demand. 
Defense revenue of $28.4 million was up 7% sequentially, this quarter after being up 16% sequentially last quarter. Similar to last quarter we launched many new GaN based products with continued strong customer interests. In fact during the quarter we were proud to announce achieving a major industry milestone, manufacturing readiness level 9 as determined by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. This achievement means that TriQuint's GaN has met the full performance, cost, and capacity goals required to support full rate production for key defense programs. 
Turning on to mobile, TriQuint's third quarter revenue was a $185.2 million up 28% sequentially. This growth was due to two factors, a large product ramp at a major customer and continued strong demand from a broad set of customers primarily in China. We now expect discreet builder revenue to more than triple in 2014 as compared to 2013 and MMPA revenue is expected to grow in the range of 30%.
Broadly speaking the RF content in mobile devices is increasing and will continue to rise as a number of bands perform continue to expand. This phenomenon is being driven directly and indirectly by all parties involved in the mobile ecosystem. Carriers and governments are looking for more efficient use of expensive spectrum driving aggressive filter specifications. Handset manufacturers have sworn hard to LTE phone development requiring significantly more filter and switch content for both regional and world phones. And finally consumers want faster data rates for streaming video, photo sharing, and other data rich applications that come with LTE enabled smartphone. 
Specifically new frequency bands, wider specifications on existing bands, and carrier aggregation are creating a strong growth bucket to premium filter suppliers such as TriQuint. Our teams have been working tirelessly to expand our capacity and product grip. We continue to allocate new capital for both BAW and TC-SAW to support current and future demand. 
New capacities are coming online as we speak and we will continue to expand throughout 2015 in support of this fast growing market. Steve will now provide a detailed financial review of the quarter and outline our guidance for the fourth quarter. 
Steve Buhaly

Thank you Ralph. For the third quarter of 2014 revenue was $272.1 million, up 8% from the third quarter of 2013 and up 18% sequentially. Sequential growth was led by mobile up 28% driven by strong demand from our filters. Year-on-year networks was exceptionally strong up 45% from the third quarter 2013. For the third quarter our end market revenue split was 68% mobile devices, 22% network infrastructure, and 10% defense and aerospace.
Please refer to the supplemental data posted on the investor section of our website for more detailed breakdown and trend of our revenue by market. During the third quarter, Foxconn Technology Group was 30% of our revenue. Please note that our end customers may use multiple subcontractors to build their products and that the mix of these firms may vary over time.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.40. Gross margin was 46.6% for the third quarter of 2014, up sequentially from 41.7% and up sharply from 38.0% in the third quarter of 2013. Gross margins for 2014 year-to-date compared to the same period in 2013 grew by over a 1000 basis points, 42.0%. Active management of our portfolio highlighted by strong growth in our premium filter business and reductions in lower margin revenue contributed to the dramatic improvement in gross margin over last year and sequentially. Efficient factory execution and the cost reductions taken earlier this year also contributed to the improved margins.
Operating expenses were $74.7 million for the third quarter of 2014, up $2.7 million from the prior quarter. We hired additional premium filter designers and incurred somewhat higher costs for variable compensation. 
Tax expense for the third quarter was negligible. Net profit for the third quarter was $51.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share. Return on equity more than doubled year-on-year to 19.8%. Total cash and investments increased by $24.4 million to $247.9 million during the third quarter. Cash flow from operations of $47 million and cash from employee equity programs of $28 million was partially offset by capital expenditures. 
Third quarter capital expenditures of $54.2 million were almost entirely for premium filter capacity. We expect capital expenditures during the fourth quarter to be between $75 million and $100 million as we align our factories to keep pace with market demand by doubling our premium filter capacity across both BAW and TC-SAW. These incremental investments will directly address an exciting set of market opportunities where we see intense customer interest. 
Moving to our financial outlook, we believe fourth quarter revenue will be between $330 million and $340 million, up 23% sequentially at the midpoint and up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be between 46% and 48% driven by product mix, better yields, and lower factory costs. 
Operating expenses are expected to be about $75 million in line with last quarter. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share is expected to be between $0.40 and $0.45 per share. As of today we are fully booked, the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance.
On the investor relations front, we are looking forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day on November 18th in New York which we will hold jointly with RFMD. A link to the live audio webcast and presentation materials will be available on the Investor Section of our website. Given our pending merger with RFMD, we are not providing a tentative date for our Q4 2014 conference call at this time. 
I will now turn the call over to Ralph for closing comments after which we will open the call to your questions.
Ralph Quinsey

Thanks Steve. Overall the mobile market is in the midst of a long-term growth cycle fuelled by the adoption of LTE and the growth of the smart phone as the primary access device to the internet. This transition creates a significant increase to mobile RF content and in particular premium filters, high performance switches, and high efficiency amplifiers. 
Additionally we see an extended cycle of infrastructure spending to support the large growth and worldwide data traffic expected over the next decade. This creates long-term revenue opportunities for TriQuint where we have leveraged leadership GaAs/GaN technology and premium filters into an expanding portfolio of long lifecycle products for this market. 
Lastly we remain in the early innings of a defense industry upgrade cycle with the ramp of the joint strike fighter and the retrofit of U.S. and international fleets to phase their radar and advanced electronics for defense applications. TriQuint's improving financial performance is a result of long-term investments and strategic technology and product development. These investments help enable smaller and faster smart phones for consumers and greater power efficiency and bandwidth for IDP system developers. I expect Qorvo our combined company with RFMD will benefit from this legacy technology development. 
TriQuint brings advanced SAW, TC-SAW, BAW and industry leading GaAs/GaN technologies to each of our markets as well as strong customer relationships and deep expertise in infrastructure and defense application. This coupled with RFMD's leadership and complex high performance switching, strong mobile systems expertise, and low cost assembly and test operations positions Qorvo as a truly differentiated leader in two synergistic markets. The high growth market of mobile and the high performance, high value markets of infrastructure and defense. 
Qorvo will be endowed with a comprehensive portfolio of technologies and unmatched engineering expertise to serve the world's most demanding customers while being equipped with the scaling cost structure to competitively deliver benchmark financial performance. I look forward to this professional completion of the remaining regulatory approvals and the launch of Qorvo. Kyle, we would now like to take questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Your line is open. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Thanks very much. Ralph, couple of questions here, on BAW capacity I think last time we chatted it was about 400 million a year, are you still at that level now or has it increased. It sounds given the CAPEX expansion, it sounds like from today's results that the premium filter demand is still exceeding expectations? So, second question is how far do you think the doubling in capacity that you outlined last quarter will take you, will it be in 2015 or you think it will get it in 2016 the way things look now and then I have a follow-up?
Ralph Quinsey

Sure, and I think that if all the revenue attributed to BAW is in that range of 400 million maybe a little higher depends upon the mix of payout revenue and how much you take of that. But you are on track and again thinking of it doubling is probably a good way to think of it going forward. We are seeing quite strong demand right now. You know the fundamental structural reasons as far as expanding filter content, it is very broad based demand and as far as future spending we will spend to keep up with the market. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

So, no commitment on how far the doubling will you get you. I think last year or even earlier this year you were thinking that your existing capacity would take you probably into 2015 but that's been sidelined by what looks to be very strong demand overall. But with this doubling you just pretty much -- any guarantees if it all will get to mid next year you think or beyond?
Ralph Quinsey

Well typically we are investing now for revenue that is somewhere in the future in the range of depending upon the type of capacity anywhere from 16 to 18 months. But we believe the cycle will continue. So I think we are well positioned to handle the growth over the next 18 months but depending upon the market demand which I think will continue to go up we will continue to invest and keep up with the market. 
Steve Buhaly

And I will just add as you know we recognize capital expense when we pay the bills but that's usually proceeds implementation of production by three or four months depending on equipment lead time. So as usual second half of the year is often the strongest and we are getting ourselves well prepared for that with recognizing capital expense now.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

Good and then Avago is running hotter than 100% in the (inaudible) I noticed that publicly before and that doesnât come online until later this year, beginning of next. Are you seeing share gains from still over demand, do you think, I know it is difficult to assess but -- and is it pushing you towards the limit of your capacity now or you are going to get a pinch time between your expansion and where you stood today. And then bigger picture, how is that effecting pricing. I mean were you securing about shortages in BAW overall so where is pricing relative to where you were last year?
Steve Buhaly

Yes the market is quite strong. We are not so focused on share gains or share loss. At this point we are focused on growing with the market. You know the market is doubling in a two year period. As far as pricing, the products that we build on these technologies are largely performance driven. So I wouldnât say there has been a lot of swing in pricing. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

And then what's the split, given how it kind of exploded in a broad based demand outside of your largest customer what's the split now between discreet and integrated filter sales for you. I think you had said before, about 100 million you expected this year in discreet, so that's great. Is it still a case or is it split more 50-50 or how is the breakup?
Ralph Quinsey

It will be much higher than a 100 million this year in discreet and a good rule of thumb is probably 50-50 revenue from discreet and from highly integrated products. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

And last year what was the discreet orâ¦
Ralph Quinsey

I think the exciting story year-on-year is discreet filters have tripled this year versus last year and we are likely to do more in a given quarter now than we did in 2013 as a whole. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

Great, and then you talked about premium filters and that's both BAW and TC-SAW and TC-SAW is out of four to five (ph) how are these used spaces, expansion there are going to require brick and mortar expansion. Will it take longer or can you add equipment because I think when we think about strategy we are talking about being pretty tight there overall between all the SAW and TC-SAW building?
Ralph Quinsey

Well we have been adding equipments for that factory all year this year and we still have some room to squeeze in some more equipment. But we can grow in that factory without more brick and motor at this point. 
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research

Alright and then final question, you mentioned MMPA is up significantly year-over-year but that came off a fairly small base last year and is it primarily reference design for a base manufacturer or are you seeing design outside of that in lower cost phone?
Steve Buhaly

Yeah, primarily design inch is on a smaller base than our filter revenue, you are right. It is still good growth and again success in China and success where we have targeted performance. 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss, Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. 
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group
Hi guys, nice job. Ralph are you losing any business from not having enough capacity, are you turning down any designs on the BAW side? And then secondly love to hear your current thoughts on recurring contribution margin? And then lastly given your guide for Q4 is it fairly similar between your biggest customer and also what you are seeing out of China, curious to hear more detail on China sequentially in the Q4, thanks?
Ralph Quinsey

So, we are tight and our premium filter capacity probably tighter on the high performance SAW and the BAW. Demand continues to go up and so we are chasing rising forecast but we are doing a relatively good job serving demand in BAW. In some cases lead times have stretched out. 
As far as the growth in China if I understood the question correctly is primarily from the BAW devices. We are just seeing very broad based adoption of our filters and the expansion of LTE phones in China. 
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group

Okay, and then I guess for Steve, the cash base margin question. 
Steve Buhaly

Yeah, I am going to stick with the 55% right now. I think thatâs working with our improved portfolio. 
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group

And then lastly Steve what is your current capacity utilization?
Steve Buhaly

We are doing extremely well. It mixes the variants we did by plant, little bit lower in GaAs and pretty well up against it in terms of premium filters. 
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group

Okay, great job guys, thank you. 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open. 
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks for taking my question. Ralph there is some concern about excess 3G and 4G smart phone inventory in China. I understand the content growth dynamics but could you give us some color on how you see the supply demand dynamic there from a unit perspective?
Ralph Quinsey
I think from a textbook perspective when you see this type of growth, it is not uncommon to have these questions. I am not seeing evidence of excess right now. We donât have as much exposure in 3G. I have anecdotal evidence of some access in 3G. We just donât have the tremendous amount of exposure there and 4G demand remains strong. 
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Got it, and then the content trends at your largest customer, how do you see those sort of conceptually playing out because again another pushback that investors probably have is that, that high end customer is doing very well right now but could we be reaching peak levels and content at that customer?
Ralph Quinsey

Yes, without specifically referencing any particular customer we are seeing quite a bit of content in these global LTE phones, north of $13. And regional phones probably in the range of $8. 
I think if you look at just those instances you are not getting a full picture of the expansion of the opportunity because it is more about the migration from 2G, 3G, to 4G and really driving up the aggregate demand for a variety of components. So it turns out that filters and switches are at the tip of the spear because of the nature of the architecture of the phone. So I see fairly strong demand in those areas and then continued strong demand as we are seeing in high performance, highly integrated, high efficiency amplifiers for some time. I understand that when the market is growing like this people get concerned about corrections. My sense is like I said probably an appropriate question to ask and maybe sometime in the next 12 months we will see some correction. I donât this it is going to change the long transactor of this market for the RF industry. I think it is going to be a strong market for some time. 
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Got it and one last one, obviously very strong performance on the gross margin side Steve, and obviously I think you are benefiting from the mix shift to more of your premium filters. As you look out over the next year I guess the good or bad news is that you have already achieved a lot of the gross margin targets that you had set as a combined company with RFMD. So without talking about the combined company how should we think about the gross margin drivers that you have left from this point onwards? Thank you.
Steve Buhaly

So let me just talk about TriQuint. You know I took a look over the last nine months of this year in comparison to the same nine months from the prior to see why didnât we pick that 1000 plus spaces for a gross margin improvement and how sustainable is it. It turns out that about just over half of the improvement came from our improved portfolio. Definitely more premium filters, less lower end active devices. And I think that has got a great leg. In fact I think that's got some room to continue while the low margin active portfolio is quite small now. There it still looks like terrific growth prospects in premium filters. 
And then a couple of 100 basis points came from our shuttering of the Texas 6 inch line and as you probably remember we were able to move a lot of that equipment and personnel into our growing BAW line both of which were in Texas. And then yielding scrap have improved significantly year-on-year and then along with that a little bit of revenue growth helped. So I think all those are very sustainable and I think we will continue to see very healthy margins from TriQuint's business into 2015.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Hey thank you. 
Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Your line is open. 
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.
Hey guys let me just say for substantial results both on the top line and especially the margins, Ralph just wanted to come back to your prepared script, I think you made some comments about your sort of outlook for 2015 and was wondering if you could just reiterate those expectations. I think you said that that you feel pretty well positioned to outgrow the broader market so was just hoping you could clarify that?
Ralph Quinsey

When we look at the strength in two areas like margin and revenue growth we saw -- we are seeing a pretty good deal. We have got with the mid-point guidance of Q4, growth of about 14% in 2014 and as Steve just highlighted great growth in margin performance. That's with the headwind of -- in both revenue and margin of the lower margin business, the non-strategic foundry that we are dealing with this year. That falls away largely for 2015 and so I think we will see a healthy growth rate in 2015. We think the market is growing in the range of 10% to 15%. Their goal is to grow faster than the market and I think that you will see the benefits of the margin improvement continue to build through the bottom line as well. 
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.
And just wondering obviously you have talked about contemplating (ph) to get a premium filter 2014 versus 2015, any outlook you could give us for 2015 premium filter and then I have got one more follow-up?
Ralph Quinsey

I am quite confident we will grow but I am not ready at this time to put a number on it. That is why it tripled twice in a row. 
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.

Agreed, and then lastly just you made some good comments on the base station business. First off can you give us obviously lots of comments coming about demand from base stations in China wondering if you could share your thoughts on what you are seeing out of the China markets specifically. And then you also mentioned India as an opportunity, are you finally starting to see the LTE orders from India. Are those starting to be placed or is that still more on a to come basis?
Ralph Quinsey

I can't tell you specifically I am seeing the orders being placed. Just recently the first licenses were released. It is a great opportunity for us going forward. As far as India, as far as China yes, we have just seen a good solid build out throughout the year, another area with fast growth where we have been worried about a correction. Havenât seen signs of a correction yet. And pretty much the same story that if in fact we do see a correction, donât see one you have in the right but if you do I donât think it will change the long-term trend line for the industry where we are just seeing very strong build out demand. We have plateaued now at about $100 million a year level, up significantly over the last 18 months. I think you will see continued growth but it could be more growth that we are used to not 50% to 60% in here but more single digit growth year-over-year in the base station market. But sustained for I think quite a long time. 
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co.

Great, thank you. 
Operator

Next question comes from the line Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open. 
Blayne Curtin - Barclays Capital 

Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Just coming back to the China market, obviously buying out far as capacity seems tight, just any perspective, I know you are a smaller player but outside of (inaudible) or any of their components particularly PA is seeing any tightness when you comment on your outlook for that market, do you have any perspective outside of filter line?
Ralph Quinsey

The only area of perspective here outside of filters is that I believe there is some constraint in SOI, our SOI in the marketplace. We see that as well but other than that I have heard a lot of constraints. This is what I mentioned. 
Blayne Curtin - Barclays Capital

Got you and then Steve, on the gross margin you upsided nicely in the quarter and I think you are seeing it about in flat in December, now you have a slight uptick. Typically you are building, you seasonally declined in March and you often see utilizations and margins go down. Is it really the filters here that is keeping the margins up or are you still riding GaAs utilizations quite strongly into December?
Steve Buhaly

You know I think we will have a -- let me start over, half the margin improvement is portfolio mix so it is not really going to change much. In Q1 if anything we have a little bit more infrastructure in defense which is healthy margin. The transition of our Texas 6 inch line isnât going to change. So I continue to expect us to have very significantly improved margins on a year-on-year. Obviously Q1 can be a little softer but I think it is going to be pretty good. 
Ralph Quinsey

And I would just add on the GaAs utilization, we did make adjustments in the early part of the year. Late last year, early part of this year as far as cost structure with our GaAs capacities and as Steve mentioned we did transfer a significant amount of equipment from GaAs factories into filter factories. So, the headwind of gas utilization just isnât that big of an issue right now for us. We took out just for reference about $20 million of annual expense out of the Oregon plant a year ago. 
Blayne Curtin - Barclays Capital

Okay and just one final question Steve, I know this will probably roll in next year, the tax rate has been pretty diminimus this year. You have been talking 10%, is that still the right number?
Steve Buhaly

Yeah, that's a reasonable number for TriQuint. 
Blayne Curtin - Barclays Capital

Okay, thanks guys. 
Operator

Next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is open. 
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James 

Great, thanks a lot guys. I would like to add my congratulations on the great numbers. Just curious as we look at the March quarter which is typically seasonally down and alright as sensors good growth coming, but could that be a pretty decent down tick in the revenue as we saw last year?
Ralph Quinsey

Way too early to talk about Q1, no reason to believe that it would not be typical and historical as far as the seasonality. 
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James

Okay great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the technology around premium filters evolving over the next couple of years in the context of integration or shrinks such that as you do your capacity adds, how do you balance adding that capacity rapidly versus maybe not needing as much in the future if you do more integration and shrinks?
Steve Buhaly

Right, great question. Most of the development right now that we are putting into filters from a technology perspective is for improved performance. The footprint or the filter is off and determined by the frequency. We have optimized the number of die per wafer we have gone through the traditional space optimization in die shrinks. But it is not like the silicon world where you see generations of optical shrinks, the filter world, the power world doesnât follow that path. And an interesting point is that if not just the filter technology TriQuint has invested in successfully develop great wafer level packaging for highly integrated modules that include filters and that is a strong component for our BAW technology as well as for our BAW technology because that is what allows us to really create a high performance cost effective highly integrated modules in the future. 
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James

Okay great and then just as you mentioned this year you have got some headwinds in growth just because you are walking away from some business, sounds like specific products you are talking about are going away. But are there any other businesses or parts of the business that you may walk away from next year in any of your segments?
Ralph Quinsey

I think we are well stabilized in our transition. There were some low margin product and some non-strategic foundry that we have been transitioning out of for some time. I have been talking about it for some time and that is largely behind us now as we transition into 2015.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James

Okay and last question, just on the Chinese handset site, can you talk a little bit about the transitioning there in terms of how those guys are gaining share and you would expect their growth to be say in the next year. 
Steve Buhaly

Yeah, no news to people on this call that China Inc is doing quite well in ramping up great smart phone not just for indigenous consumption but also pretty good shares developing now in Europe. So I see fairly broad category of customers in China of which I am happy to report they are all customers of TriQuint doing quite well in this generations smart phone. 
Ralph Quinsey

It is interesting to know that if you include Avnet Asia as a primary Chinese company. Three of our top five customers in the quarter were in China including Avnet Asia. So things have definitely changed there as that market has taken off. 
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James

Great, thanks guys and congrats.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Burton from Brean Capital. Your floor is open. 
Mike Burton - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.
Hey guys congratulations on the good results and guide. Most of mine have been asked but I wanted to ask about the upcoming merger with RFMD, can you give us a sense of some of the joint projects that you have been able to work on before and after the shareholder vote, if there is anything that is actually being held up by the pending MASQAM (ph) approval?
Ralph Quinsey
Yeah, it is probably inappropriate to get into too much detail for obvious reasons. I would say most of the focus is on building a platform of technology capability and cost structure to be successful as opposed to any intense joint development of products. We do see great opportunities across the board not just with the mobile market which is tremendous and Steve pointed out we are making significant investments to leverage that technology into Qorvo going forward. But really good synergistic activities going on between the two IDP like business. So net, net I couldnât be happier with the amount of energy, with the progress being made, with the tone of the teams that are executing the integration, they are keeping the momentum in our business and they are creating a platform for success as we reach conclusion of this merger. 
Mike Burton - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.

Thanks and we will look forward to more of an update at the Analyst Day. Steve I was just wondering on the OPEX side too, the good cost control adding into Q4, how should we expect OPEX to trend for TriQuint going into next year, thanks?
Steve Buhaly

You know I think TriQuint's OPEX will be flat to down a little bit actually. We have a couple of things inflating it right now, lot of employee stock option exercises which are driving FICA cost up and then we do have some enhanced variable cost this quarter as we have achieved better results than we expected. So both of those would wash out with the beginning of the New Year and I think we would be pretty flattish.
Mike Burton - Brean, Murray, Carret & Co.

Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of David Bluey (ph), please go ahead. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst 

Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I guess couple of clarification questions, Steve could you just repeat what you said the book to bill was during the quarter?
Steve Buhaly

Sure, it was 1.40.
Unidentified Analyst

1.40, and then I think you mentioned that you are 100% booked to the revenue guidance and usually you are 90% to 95% booked, is that accurate?
Steve Buhaly

We said fully booked and yeah we are usually about 90% but we are about a week later as was typically announced?
Unidentified Analyst

Okay, and I am sorry I might have lost track of this, you might have said it, what do you expect the total filter revenue to be in 2014 and perhaps what was it in the quarter that just finished?
Ralph Quinsey

Yeah, not an easy number to be definitive with because a significant amount of the revenue comes from the places that have filters integrated within them. So what I said for 2014, consistent with what we have said in the past is a 400 million number is reasonable and it might be a little bit north of that leans forward and takes in a lot of revenue for the total integrated devices. So, 400 million is a pretty decent number. 
Unidentified Analyst

Okay, and that would be for 2014 split roughly between discreets and the embedded, however you want to call that?
Ralph Quinsey

Roughly yes. 
Unidentified Analyst

Okay. And just a clarification, on the Chinese base station revenue or ramp or whatever you are seeing there, a lot of other semiconductor guys have seen a pause and you seem to see your business I guess flatten out and many of the sites go down and now it is starting to ramp up again, would you expect that to grow on a sequential basis throughout the next couple of quarters for you?
Ralph Quinsey

You know for us we think that the network business in Q4 is going to be relatively flat. We will see some growth in defense and we will see growth in mobile. So that is the near-term visibility. Longer-term, like I said I think that base station is really swung up hard and now I think it will revert to more traditional growth rates in the mid single digits. Defense business looks very positive going forward, it typically has that mid single digit type of footprint. And then mobile devices I can say we see that markets growing in that 10% to 15% range. 
Unidentified Analyst

Thanks, one final thing from me is, on customer concentration, would you expect it to become less concentrated over the next couple of quarters and would you expect there to be a -- or one of these Chinese customer show up as a 10% customer eventually?
Ralph Quinsey

In fact it has become less concentrated already. We are now serving over 50 customers with our discreet filters and as Steve pointed out China are rather are. 
Steve Buhaly

Yeah, I think there is every chance Huawei to be 10% customer at some point. If you remember Huawei was last quarter, so though it is non-common and I won't be surprised if it happens again. 
Unidentified Analyst

Thank you.

Your last question comes from the line Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co
Good afternoon. So I was hoping to first get clarification, did you say it was 16 to 18 months before your capital spend turns into revenue? 
Steve Buhaly
No, I think it will be -- I think it will much -- you might be looking at 4 to 6 months between recognition of the expense and implementation of productive capacity. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co

Okay, that is good to hear, so some of this -- spending into them right now actually will help you in 2015 in the second half?
Ralph Quinsey

Oh, I think all of it will. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co

I got a little scared there for a minute and then hoping to get a little bit more on the relative size of the segments of premium filters between TC-SAW and BAW, what are the relative size for use of those two markets and where do you see the relative growth rates of those two markets?
Ralph Quinsey

So, BAW is the larger opportunity, the larger part of the revenue stream. TC-SAW is a little newer technology. The overall markets are a little smaller but most likely to BAW dominate but still. TC-SAW should grow nicely over the next 18 months. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co

Okay we know a lot about your expertise on the BAW side, do you think you have a competitive advantage on the TC-SAW side as well?
Ralph Quinsey

In fact we do and it is different for different bands, the combination of technology and design expertise. But we have gotten good feedback on similar devices where it maybe the only device that solves the problem. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co

Okay and previously you talked about tripling of the revenue, is that just the BAW filters or is that the combination of all premium filters?
Ralph Quinsey
That's discreet filter revenue includes all premium filters. 
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co

Great. Okay, that's it. Thanks. 
Ralph Quinsey

Thanks Tom.
