Good day and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Given Imaging first quarter 2013 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Fern Lazar of Lazar Partners.
Fern Lazar
Good morning and thank you for joining us. With us today from Given Imaging are Homi Shamir, President and CEO; and Yuval Yanai, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I'd like to read the following regarding forward-looking statements. During the course of this conference call the company may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of Given Imaging.
We wish to caution you that such statements reflect only the company's current expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. You are kindly referred to the risk factors and cautionary language contained in the documents that the company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed March 7, 2013. The company undertakes no obligations to update any projections or forward-looking statements in the future.
In today's call, the company will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating expenses. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the company's first quarter 2013 financial results press release, which is posted on the Given Imaging website.
I'll now turn the call over to Homi Shamir, President and CEO of Given Imaging.
Nachum Shamir
Thanks, Fern, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. In the first quarter of 2013, we were very encouraged that we returned to solid sales growth in both the EMEA and APAC regions, which demonstrate record Q1 revenue growth of 5% and 20%, respectively.
However, we were disappointed that the total revenue growth in the quarter was below our expectations due mainly to a shortfall in sales execution in the America regions. We have taken decisive action to correct this situation. We expect that the Americas region will be back on track in the second quarter.
So far, we are encouraged by second quarter's sales to date, which are ahead of last year at this time. While we normally do not disclose any information about the current quarter, we wanted to update you because we are confident that we can achieve our financial guidance provided earlier this year.
On a positive note, I am pleased to report that the first quarter of 2013 gross margin was strong. On a GAAP basis, we achieved gross margin of 77.1% compared to 75.6% in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin reached 78.1% compared to 76.2% last year. Yuval, will provide additional financial detail shortly.
The most important medical meeting of the year for Given Imaging, Digestive Disease Week begins next week in Orlando. More than 120 abstracts covering out seven PillCam functional on GI diagnostic products will be presented at the meeting.
Importantly, data from PillCam COLON 2 U.S.A. pivotal trial to asses the accuracy and safety of PillCam COLON 2 compared to optical colonoscopy in 885 station will be presented in a podium presentation by lead investigator Dr. Douglas Rex, of Indiana University Medical Centre. Following his presentation in the conference on May 21, we will be hosting a meeting with member of the financial community to review data as well as other highlights.
Dr. Rex, will discuss PillCam COLON 2 data and Dr. Cristiano Spada of Rome will review additional PillCam COLON 2 abstract. Dr. Sam Adler of Israel will discuss highlight of our next generation PillCam SB 3. This event will also be webcast and we look forward to your participation.
On the PillCam COLON 2 regulatory front, we are encouraged with our advance discussion with both U.S.A. and Japanese regulatory authorities and continue to expect decision this year. We started shipping our next generation PillCam SB 3 capsules in Europe and Australia at the beginning of the second quarter.
PillCam SB 3 offer physician enhanced image quality and enclosed adaptive frame rate technology used in our PillCam COLON 2 capsules. We received very positive feedback from physician, who has begun using the product and believe that PillCam SB 3 will further solidify our global competitive and leadership position.
We remain on target to launch PillCam SB 3 in the U.S.A. later this year, pending FDA 510 clearance. We look forward to telling you more about this product during our Investor Call at DDW. At DDW we will be celebrating a significant milestone for Given Imaging, the sale of 2 million PillCam capsules. We sold our first capsule in 2001 and eight years later we reached 1 million capsules sold. It took us just four years to sell an additional 1 million capsules.
I will now turn in the call over to Yuval Yanai, who will provide additional details on our first quarter result.
Yuval Yanai
Thanks. As Homi mentioned, we achieved revenues of $40.6 million in first quarter of 2013. Revenue in the Americas region in the first quarter decreased 11% to $23.9 million, for reasons Homi just discussed. In the EMEA region, revenues increased 8% to $11.6 million from $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2012.
Revenues in the APAC region increased 20% in the first quarter of 2013 to $5.1 million from $4.2 million in the same period in 2012. It should be noted that the weakening Japanese yen had an adverse effect of approximately $400,000 on the regions revenues compared to last year.
Total PillCam SB sales were 54,600 capsules in the first quarter of 2013, a 3% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2012. In the Americas region, PillCam SB sales in the first quarter decreased 8% to 30,800 capsules compared to 33,700 capsules in the same period of last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, PillCam SB in the EMEA region increased 3% to 15,500 capsules, while PillCam SB sales in the APAC region increased 7% to 8,300 capsules.
Worldwide sales of functional diagnostics products decreased by 12% to $11 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $12.6 million in the same period last year. The decline is mainly due to the shortfall in revenues in the Americas region.
In the Americas region, functional diagnostics products revenue decreased 17% in the first quarter of 2013 to $8.3 million compared to $10 million in the same period last year. Functional diagnostics revenue in the EMEA region was $2.3 million compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. Revenues in the APAC region was $400,000 compared to $700,000 in the same period last year.
On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $100,000 compared to $400,000 in the first quarter of 2012. The decline in GAAP and non-GAAP operating profit is attributable predominantly to the decline in revenues. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2 million compared to $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2012.
The company did not record financial income in the first quarter. Interest income derived from financial investment was completely offset by the translation losses resulting from the devaluation of the U.S. dollar compared to Israeli currency. This quarter, cash used in operating activities totaled $2.2 million.
On a GAAP basis, net loss for the first quarter of 2013 was $200,000 or $0.01 per share compared to net income of $200,000 or $0.01 per share in the same quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2013 was $1.5 million or $0.05 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $1.8 million or $0.06 per share on a fully diluted basis in the first quarter of 2012. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP earning is available in our first quarter press release, which is posted on our website.
Moderator, you may now open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
First wanted to, I guess if we look at the U.S., I mean results were down across the entire portfolio. I guess just want a little more color, what were you guys seeing with this kind of a slow utilization quarter in general? And if so, I know, Homi, you commented on stronger trends thus far in the second quarter. What are you seeing or is there something that has happened to improve trends this quarter or was there something more going on last quarter?
Nachum Shamir
I think first quarter was, the only thing is execution in the U.S.A. team. It's sometimes like we are into the NBA finals now. It's like you had a bad game. We know some player did not show up the way we wanted it. We made some adjustments, and we believe this adjustment will make us in the right direction. And the way we start progressing with the Q2, I don't think there is any fundamental difference. As a matter of fact, I am very bullish, we have a great team in the U.S.A., and we just had a bad game.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
But is there any sort of specific, some players had a bad game. What kind of adjustments did you or are you making to ensure, because I know it's a commentarial, so you haven't altered guidance at all. So I assume that means that whatever adjustments you made have been put in place and those numbers should be back on track the rest of this year?
Nachum Shamir
Yes, we really don't want to go to the detail. You normally in a game don't talk too much about the court and let (inaudible). We believe we make all the right changes, and there is no doubt in our mind that U.S.A. team is going to deliver and that's why we're feeling very confident in our guidance for the year. So we remain on track. And again, let's see the result of the second quarter, but so far I feel it was (inaudible) given the last couple of days, because we're tracking them and we see them as a good progress.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
And then one or two quickly on Japan. It looks like things have settled down there. I remember, last couple of quarters were a little lumpy with the transitions to the direct sales force. Can I assume from these numbers that, that is now progressing on track and we shouldn't have these issues any more?
Nachum Shamir
Yeah, Japan is moving and progressing very well with the sales execution. Just to remind, most of all, over between 60% or 70% of sales now in Japan coming directly. A standard indication, the one that we got last year is working very well. We see more and more utilization into this market. And we are very pleased. But again, we have to continue from quarter-to-quarter to achieve better in Japan and we intend to do so.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
One more on the U.S. and then I'll hop back in queue. Should we read anything into maybe in the U.S., was there any distraction from that sale process that you had undergone, might that have been a bit of a contributor?
Nachum Shamir
Not at all. As a matter of fact, through all the sales process, we did not lose any talent whatsoever bought in the company in the U.S.A. or in the corporate. As a matter fact, we recently refilled some position that were very good talent, so no, not at all.
Operator
We will go next to Bryan Brokmeier of Maxim Group.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Was North America weak throughout the quarter or how do they trend during the quarter?
Nachum Shamir
Generally it was a good month then we dip into. That's what happened, Bryan.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
And when did you make the adjustments that you expect to reaccelerate the growth in North America?
Nachum Shamir
Beginning of this quarter, beginning of April.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
And what are you seeing, you've previously talked about colonoscopies as leading indication of your volumes and what are you seeing in terms of colonoscopy volume in the United States and are you seeing that also starting to improve in the second quarter?
Nachum Shamir
We did not monitor, Bryan. We do not monitor recently how colonoscopy, but talking with physician, generally question, how is business? And they said business is good. And because it's mainly driven by colonoscopy, so I don't think even if we get the result data, we'll find that there is a decline in colonoscopy.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
And just back in terms of the performance in North America, Sierra in particular was below my expectations. Any details on how that specifically was weak in the quarter as opposed to just overall weakness of the SB business?
Nachum Shamir
Yeah, if you look, we were down across the board, so that's also showing and demonstrate that there some micro, or some issue particular in small bowel or in Bravos here, it just was across the board.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
You really didn't talk too much about China. I know that that's an area that was a little bit, didn't sort of, pick up as much as you would have liked to last year, but from the prior conversations, it sounds like the distributor is really starting to understand the business and getting up and running. Is China performing well so far, sort of, what's your outlook on China for the remainder of the year?
Nachum Shamir
A decent, not outstanding, really the most, as I keep saying Asia-Pacific is driven by three areas, which is Japan was a very good quarter, Australia; we had a very good quarter. China was decent. Again, we believe it will perform to our expectation, but really is the biggest and as you know also from pricing point of view, both Japan and Australia are much higher pricing per capsules, so that's really where most of the revenue coming. There is also a very good business in China coming out of manometry and we have close to 200 units installed in China, that also a good business for us.
But as I said, decent, but we're really focusing to make sure Japan is our biggest opportunity by far not only from quantity of capsules also from the price we are selling in Japan. As we know it's a close to $800 per capsule. The opportunity of COLON that is not far from ours, so and obviously the expanded indication we have in the SB. So that's our focus, but obviously China is important, but China is not a huge contributor from a dollar point of view.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
And lastly, in terms of the SB 3 launch in Europe and Australia. You said that's going well and doctors are encouraged, you are encouraged by the reception from doctors, but I was assuming you might still have some inventory of SB 2 capsules. And still wondering how you expect that transition to occur in transitioning doctors over from the SB 2 to the SB 3. How you expect that to aspire over the next couple of years.
Yuval Yanai
I think we are well experienced in transitioning between products. We did it quite successfully in the past and we have detailed transition plan also for this year. So we assume that once we have a full deployment of SB 3, we are not left with any SB 2 capsule or component. So we fell quite safer on this ground.
Nachum Shamir
Just one more thing to add to Yuval, as we all know regulatory approval in different part of the world is taking longer, just for an example you mentioned China. We're just applying now for SB 3, normally forces in China taking two to three year at least, so other company across the globe, so it's a process. It's not taking immediately phasing in, phasing out, it's a product mainly due to the regularity approval.
Operator
We do have another question that just came in. It comes from Paul Nouri of Noble Equity Fund.
Paul Nouri - Noble Equity Fund
So the first quarter, I guess came in a little low, but you kept your guidance for the year. And you don't want to be too specific. But are we are going to see a gradual increase towards the guidance or is it going to be really back half weighted, like third and fourth quarters?
Nachum Shamir
And normally, also you'll look that Q1 and Q4 is much better than Q2 and Q3, so that's the trend. And we are hoping also to catch-up some of the losses in Q1.
Paul Nouri - Noble Equity Fund
And it was mentioned that the Yen had I think a negative $400,000 impact in the quarter. How does that play out in the second quarter as the currency stands now?
Yuval Yanai
Well, there is no change. It will have at least the same effect because we expect second quarter to be stronger in Japan compared to the third quarter. However, it is already embedded in our anticipation that we will be able to meet our guidance, so yes there will be some quite adverse effect of the Japanese Yen. On the other hand for example, so far the year was slightly stronger than compared to what we expected and the total sale in Euro higher compared to how much we sell in Japanese Yen. So all in all, there isn't a very significant effect of currency so far.
Paul Nouri - Noble Equity Fund
And I guess final question. Looking at the gross margin that came in around 77%, is that what we can expect the rest for the year?
Yuval Yanai
We usually got two gross margin, GAAP and non-GAAP. The only difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is purchase price, price allocation expenses that are allocated on gross margin. So if I call it real gross margin, it is 78%. There is always, kind of, 1% difference between two of them. I think we've mentioned before, we can reiterate, which we believe that going forward we can maintain high gross margin.
We always talk about an average of approximately 77%. There could be quarterly fluctuation back in this quarter, and the gross margin was up to 78%. It may go down one quarter to 76%. It very much depends on the quarterly mix of products and distribution of revenues among geographies. But on average, on annual basis, we believe that 77% maybe slightly over that is a good number to take into consideration.
Operator
And we will take a follow-up from Jeremy Feffer, Cantor Fitzgerald.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Just one more quickly, I am wondering if, is there any update on IDB and what their intentions might be with that block or are they sort of quite for now?
Yuval Yanai
Well, first of all, let me tell you that we prefer not to talk on behalf of our shareholders. They announced before that they will try to sell their shares in the company. And I believe they will do what they have to do. Other than that we don't have any other news. I can say that at least from our point of view whatever is happening over our head does not affect our business at all.
Nachum Shamir
I just wanted to also add that they say that they are planning to sell it in one blow and not planning to sell it into the market.
Operator
And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the conference back over to Homi Shamir for closing remarks.
Nachum Shamir
Thank you all for joining us today for the call. I'm looking forward to see many of you with our investor community meeting at DDW in the few weeks. Thank you.
Operator
This does conclude today's conference, ladies and gentleman. Again, we appreciate everyone's participation.
