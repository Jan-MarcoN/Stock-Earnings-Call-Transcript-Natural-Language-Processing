Let me now turn the call over to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Looking back on 2013, we have much to be proud of as we expanded our focus from an Eagle Ford pure play to a company holding core positions in 2 of the most active resource areas in the United States.
We rose to meet the challenges of entering a new basin and establishing initial operations in 5 short months. We believe our results reflect the successful ongoing development of our Eagle Ford assets and our early integration of our Permian assets.
Let's review a list of key accomplishments for 2013. We set an all-time record in daily total equivalent production, daily oil production, and proved reserves. We achieved double-digit growth in annual production and reserves for all products. We ended the Permian Delaware Basin acquiring over 40,000 net acres and raised over $1 billion in capital. We successfully completed our first 2 operated horizontal wells in Southern Reeves County in the Delaware Basin. We accelerated our development activities in the Delaware Basin and spud 3 additional horizontal Wolfcamp wells by year-end 2013.
We initiated upper Eagle Ford pilots in 2 areas on Gates Ranch, and recently added 2 additional Upper Eagle Ford pilot test areas. Earlier in the year, we successfully delineated new productive Eagle Ford acreage in North LaSalle County and Live Oak County. We lowered our per-well cost by $0.5 million in all the areas of the Eagle Ford trend. We expanded our ownership interest in Gates Ranch leasehold and executed a definitive agreement to acquire a 5,000-acre bolt-on acquisition in the Delaware Basin.
We increased our total risked project inventory by 59% to 790 million barrels of oil equivalent. We successfully completed a $900 million capital program that drilled and completed a record number of new wells for the company. This included the construction of new infrastructure and various facility upgrades that will support our ongoing growth.
With that in mind, let's review a few of our accomplishments in more detail. Production for the quarter averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 17% from the same period in 2012 and 2% from the prior quarter. Production for the year averaged 50,000 barrels equivalent, up 34% from 2012. Our production growth is a result of the ongoing successful development of our Eagle Ford assets and the addition of our Permian Basin assets.
Oil production for 2013 averaged 14,000 barrels per day, an increase of 43% from 2012. Natural gas liquids daily production also increased by 43% compared to the prior year. We achieved 33% year-over-year and 9% quarterly growth versus the prior year on Eagle Ford production at 48,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Permian contributed 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year and 3,500 barrels equivalent per day for the fourth quarter. Permian volumes increased by 55% versus the third quarter, which was the first full quarter of production from the Permian assets. Our Permian production is comprised of 8 -- 6% total liquids, including 76% crude oil, and will be a growing contribution to our total production as we move into 2014.
Another significant 2013 accomplishment was the completion of our first 2 operated horizontal wells in Reeves County. The Balmorhea State 32-15 'A' 1H horizontal well tested at a 1,001 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the Upper Wolfcamp during the third quarter. The well is originally drilled by the previous operator before Rosetta assumed operation. The Gaucho State 15-2H well was completed in the Upper Wolfcamp interval in December and tested at a 7-day gross stabilized rate of 829 barrels a day equivalent. We now have 3 horizontal wells producing from the Upper Wolfcamp and plan to complete 2 additional horizontal wells during the first quarter. We're very pleased with the results we're having in the early stages of our Permian horizontal program.
In the Eagle Ford, we continued our development activities with operations on all of our liquids-rich leases in 2013, including Gates Ranch, Briscoe Ranch and the Central Dimmit leases. We successfully delineated our Tom Hanks acreage in Northern LaSalle County, and we're moving forward there with full development. In Live Oak County, we also delineated a low-PUD lease we acquired through a farm-in. John Clayton will provide more detail about our Eagle Ford and Permian operational results and plans later on the call.
As you read in our earnings press release, we did reaffirm our 2014 guidance for capital, production and expenses. We expect to spend $1.1 billion of capital for the year, excluding acquisition capital. We are estimating our 2014 average daily production guidance range at 60,000 to 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We plan to operate 4 to 5 rigs in the Eagle Ford and 6 rigs in the Delaware Basin. We are expanding our Reeves County horizontal program in 2014 to further delineate our acreage. The vertical well program will continue in the near term to hold acreage across our Permian lease position. We will also continue to pursue opportunities to acquire assets in and around our 2 core areas.
In summary, we captured exciting growth opportunities in 2013 and had set stage for continued competitive performance in 2014. We look forward to updating you on our Eagle Ford activities and the advancement of our horizontal program in Reeves County, as the year progresses.
Now let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide a summary of our financial results.
John E. Hagale
Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone. As a reminder, all of the information that I'm reviewing today is contained in our 10-K as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC yesterday and are available on our website.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $29 million or $0.48 per diluted share, versus net income of $42 million or $0.80 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income, that's non-GAAP, for the quarter was $51 million or $0.83 per diluted share, versus $42 million or $0.79 per diluted share for the quarter in 2012.
For the full year, we reported net income of $199 million or $3.39 per diluted share, versus net income of $159 million or $3.01 per diluted share for 2012. Adjusted net income for the year was $228 million or $3.87 per diluted share, versus $2.77 in 2012.
Adjusted net income in 2013 excludes unrealized derivative loss of $16 million, charges for commercial disputes of $21 million, and transaction and financing costs of $8 million. The aftertax effect of all of those adjustments was $29 million. Adjusted net income increased versus 2012, primarily due to increased production and higher oil and natural gas prices. Taking a look at revenues for the quarter, note that our oil revenues include condensate sales, which represented about 54% of our production from the fourth quarter.
Revenues in the fourth quarter were $205 million when compared to $178 million for the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter revenues, including realized derivatives, were $218 million in 2013 versus $178 million in 2012.
Our fourth quarter average realized oil price, excluding derivatives, was $88.60 a barrel. That was done $11.81 from the third quarter average of $100.41 a barrel. The sequential decrease reflects lower LLS prices for the quarter. Our realized oil price is heavily influenced by changes in LLS prices, and over the past few months, the LLS-to-WTI spread has narrowed significantly. We do have firm contracts in place for the majority of our Eagle Ford condensate, so for 2014, for the full company, I would guide you to estimate our average realized price of LLS minus $11 or $12. Again, that's total company.
Our expense guidance for 2014 was included in our earnings press release and it's outlined again in Slide 4. I want to remind you that we will continue the practice of annual guidance. As a part of our active hedging program, we added derivative positions to our production and our effort to mitigate exposure to commodity price.
During January 2014, Rosetta placed additional derivative swap positions for 2015 NGL production and 2016 gas production. You can find a detailed summary of our derivative position as of February 24 attached to the press release.
Finally, on the financing front, at the end of 2013, our borrowing base and committed amount totaled $800 million under our senior revolving credit facility. On February 24, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $800 million facility, and we had $800 million undrawn.
Let me turn the call over to John Clayton.
John D. Clayton
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Since we've signaled our 2013 operational results to you in late January, I will go through them fairly quickly this morning. This will allow me to spend more time on how we have and are developing Gates Ranch. I'll also show you our new, more localized type curves at Gates Ranch that we introduced 2 weeks ago.
I will then speak on our Upper Eagle Ford pilots and then bring you up to speed on where we are in the Permian, especially with respect to our horizontal activities. Now let's review our 2013 operational performance.
As Jim mentioned, 2013 was another record year for our company, as we achieved an all-time high in total production. Capital spending for the year was $900 million, and we drilled 150 gross operated wells and completed 113. Our total daily production averaged 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 34% from the prior year. Total Eagle Ford production was 48,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 33% from a year ago.
The total company production rate includes 13,700 barrels of oil per day and 17,500 barrels of NGLs per day. Oil production increased by 43% compared to 2012. Overall liquids production represented about 63% of total production, and annual oil production was 28% of total production, which was up 26% from a year ago. Our total production growth trends over the past 4 years remain strong, as shown on Slide 5 in the presentation. The chart highlights the growth of our Eagle Ford production, as well as our 2014 guidance.
Now let's summarize our year-end proven reserves as well as our updated capital inventory. At year end, total proven reserves increased by 39% to 279 million barrels of oil equivalent. That total includes a 60% liquids mixed, and 32% are classified as proved developed. We replaced 528% of production from all sources, including net additions from drilling activity, price revisions, proved acquisitions and performance revision. Excluding acquisitions, finding and development cost came in at $12 per BOE and replaced over 400% of production.
The changes to our proven reserve base include 83 million barrels of reserve additions, primarily from the development success in the Eagle Ford, where we completed 79 new wells, of which 29 were previously unbooked, and we added 106 PUDs. In the Permian Basin, additions were from 30 new PDPs and 81 PUDs. In total, our year-end proved undeveloped reserves include 304 PUD locations, up from 155 locations a year ago. This increase is primarily from our new asset base in the Permian and activity level outside of Gates Ranch during the year. Gates Ranch is still our largest concentration of PUDs, where we have a total of 157 locations.
We also acquired 23 million BOEs of proven reserves during the year and had 11 million BOEs of net downward revisions, which were mainly attributable to lower projected condensate yields located within the north-central portion of Gates Ranch. I'll provide more detail on this topic later in my remarks.
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proven reserves at year end was $2.3 billion, an increase of 25% from the prior year. At year end, our projected project capital inventory totaled approximately 790 million BOEs, or an increase 59% as compared to the year-end 2012 total of 496 million BOEs. As a reminder, PUDs are included in our inventory numbers, and we only report risked numbers, not unrisked.
That concludes standard operational update, and I would now like to spend some time on the development of Gates Ranch. So please turn to Slide 6 in the slide deck.
On the slide, I would like to point out a few things about Gates Ranch that are often overlooked; first, its geographical size. The Ranch is slightly more than 10 miles tall and 9 miles across. Although the Ranch does not cover that entire 90-some-odd square miles, it is important to note that well locations can be quite at distance from each other.
Next, I would like to point out that Gates Ranch is in the condensate window of the play. As you move only a few miles southward off the Ranch, you will enter the dry gas window of the Eagle Ford play. It changes that quickly as the play deepens to the south-southeast and the hydrocarbons become significantly gassier. Accordingly, this slide also points out of the condensate yields change throughout the field from a high of 80 barrels per million cubic feet in the North down to 30 barrels per million in the South. The deepest part of the Ranch is the southeast leased line, which is more than 500 feet deeper than the northwestern leased boundaries.
Let's now look at thicknesses. As a whole, Gates Ranch is in one of the thickest parts of the entire Eagle Ford play; however, it not the same across the Ranch. From a gross perspective, the thickness can range from approximately 260 feet to upwards of 350 feet. If we look at just the lower Eagle Ford, the interval with the highest resistivity, there is also variability and thickness. The lower Eagle Ford had a thickness range of 58 feet on the low end to 98 feet on the high end. To illustrate this point, take a look at the second row development on this slide.
This is the row that has both red wells and blue wells. The lower Eagle Ford on the east side of this row is 58-feet thick, the thinnest lower Eagle Ford section on the entire Ranch. Now stay on that same row and look west. The lower Eagle Ford on the west side of this row is more than 90-feet thick. Keep in mind that this row of wells system is at about the same depth and has roughly the same condensate yields; however, their thicknesses in the lower Eagle Ford varies substantially, up to 50%.
To further make the point, look back at the easternmost tip of the ranch. If you go east from there off of the ranch, not too many miles, it's our belief that the lower Eagle Ford thins to essentially nothing. So knowing where you are in the rocks will help you understand relative well performance. I could give many variables, but my point here is that, when you are looking at an asset that spans by 10 miles by 9 miles, there are numerous drivers of well productivity that need to be understood.
So let's now look at how we have chosen to develop the ranch. From the table, you can see how we got to where we are today, and more importantly, where we will be going forward. The 9-5 discovery well was drilled in 2009. It is our short lateral well on the western tip of the Ranch. In 2009, oil price was approximately $55 per barrel, and the average gas price was right at $4.
In 2010, we drilled 16 delineation wells to understand the potential across the entire geography of the ranch. You can see from this slide that if you drew one large circle around all of the green wells indicative of our entire 2010 program, the circle would encompass nearly all of the acreage, which was the point. Did these wells all perform the same? Of course, not.
If you look at the rate and EURs only, 7 of the very best wells to-date were drilled during our 2010 program year. Were they the best wells because we drilled them first? No. They happen to be the wells that were drilled in the South area that year where our rates and EURs are highest. They are much gassier, though, with condensate yields of about 1/3 of those found in the North areas.
Now look at the gold wells. Those are the wells we drilled in 2011. At that time, our company was still more than 70% natural gas, while oil prices were now at about $85 per barrel and the average gas price was still in the $4 range. We made the conscious decision to start our field development in the oilier part of the ranch, as determined by our 2010 delineation program, which at that time was North area. By doing so, we drilled the majority of wells that year on what we now call the Row 1.
As you can see from the slide, we also drilled a few more delineation wells in the far North and a few more in the South, but the majority of the work was done on Row 1. Interesting enough, the 3 wells up that were drilled in the South area during our 2011 program year, are 3 of the highest-rate, highest EUR wells on the ranch to-date. Was that because they were drilled in the second year of our program? No, it was because they were located in the South.
Let's move to the 2012 program, which is shown by wells colored in red. In 2012, our average realized oil price was now at about $91 per barrel, and the average gas price had fallen below $3 per MCF. We also tightened up our spacing by then to 450 feet between laterals and began development on what we now called Row 2 of the Ranch. Row 2 is also in the North and more oilier area, but less oilier than Row 1 wells, since it's further down dip and towards the gas window.
Although we drilled the same amount of wells over the prior year, the geographic acreage size that was drilled and completed was much more localized and totaled only 2,000 acres, or about 10% of the ranch geographically. You will notice that for the first time, our annual program did not drill any wells in the southern portion of the ranch; hence, no high-rate, high-EUR wells that would have brought the average well performance for that year's program up.
Falling into 2013, our goal was simple: finish up the Row 1, excluding drilling across our 9-5 discovery -- excluding drilling across our 9-5 discovery well, then finish up Row 2 and also drill Upper Eagle Ford pilots in different portions of the field, which I will talk about later. But let's talk about our most recent year's program, 2013 , where the wells results are shown in blue.
I mentioned earlier that the lower Eagle Ford thickness is at its lowest on the eastern side of the field, where it is at about 58-feet thick. This is where the majority of our 2013 completions occurred. Did we find this out during the drilling of the 2013 program? No, we didn't. Remember, we mapped the field based on vertical wells back in 2008 and 2009 time period. If we needed additional data points, we drilled our vertical pilots during our 2010 delineation program prior to plugging them back and going horizontal.
We also drilled a portion of our 2013 program on the western side of the field. Those wells were brought on production very late in 2013. This area, as mentioned earlier, has some of the thickest lowest Eagle Ford of about 90 feet, hence, we should expect different results from the later 2013 wells, if compared to the earlier 2013 wells on the East, just based on lower Eagle Ford thickness alone.
Not to get too much into the weeds, but just so we're all on the same page, let's look at the far western side of both Row 1 and Row 2. We stoped Row 1 short of the western boundary because of the producing discovery well. If not for that well, we would have finished of that row during our 2012 program. We will eventually plug that well 1 day and drill across it to finish off Row 1. We also stopped short of Row 2 on the west end, because at that time, we did not own 100% of the acreage on that row. We do own it today, which is why we recently finished off that row just a few months ago, and those wells are performing nicely.
Going forward into this year, 2014, our overall general goals are simple: turn the corner from Row 2 East and start Row 3 moving East to West. I often get asked why we didn't drill our highest-return, highest-EUR areas first, meaning the South? My answer is simple. Coming out of our 2010 delineation program, oil prices were relatively high compared to the depressed natural gas prices we were seeing. Couple that with the fact we were essentially a conventional natural gas company, we wanted to increase our exposure to oil and decrease our exposure to natural gas. Also at that time, firm transportation capacity demand was at an all-time high in this area, and our thoughts were that one well in the gassier South would consume a significant larger portion of our contracted spare capacity than one well drilled in the oilier North area.
Another question we get is; why does our annual program results appear to be declining each year? Now no one is apologizing for 1-million-barrel-EUR well, but if you're not privy to the underlying drivers of our decisions to this point, it is a very valid question. Our 2013 program's performance, excluding the rows on Row 2 to the west that were not brought on until just a few months ago, should have been and was less than our 2012 program on the same row that was drilled in a much thicker lower Eagle Ford section of rock.
Our 2012 program's performance should have been, and was, less than the 2011 program that focused on the North acreage, but also had nearly 10% of its wells drilled in the very prolific, but gassier South area. Our 2011 program's performance should have been, and was, less than the 2010 program that tested the entire property, which included 44% of the wells being drilled in the gassier South. That's quite a bit of historical data and all of our program years have had tremendous results regarding the order -- regardless of the order in which they were drilled, but I hope that this helps understanding how we have and are approaching the development of Gates Ranch.
With all that said, it has been 2.5 years since we have updated our typical type curves for Gates Ranch, and since that time, we have drilled nearly 100 more wells in the field or roughly triple the well count. More importantly, we've now had time to well performance over that time period. So 2 weeks ago, we rolled out 4 distinct type curves for the property. These curves are updated and located on Slide 7. We now have a far north curve, a north-central curve, a southeast curve and a far south curve.
To build these type curves we groups wells geographically across the field, and the historical will data is plotted on these normalized type curves as well. This is how we model the areas, and knowing where a well is located, should help with understanding its performance. The majority of next year or so of the development will occur along the third row, moving from east to west. That's not to say, there won't be a few wells drilled towards the north, but look for us to finish off the third row next, which would be characteristic of the southeast and far south type curves.
I would also like to talk about those spacing, so please turn to Slide 8. We have updated our well performance that compares our first row wells on a 850-foot spacing to those on the second row at 450-foot spacing. You guys have seen this plot before, and it has been updated for you. Although the second row condensate yield is somewhat lower than that on the first row, this is in line with our expectations of varying yields as you move Northwest to Southeast across the field.
I want to now share our views of the well performance as we move south into development. So please turn to Slide 9.
There is a lot of data on this slide, but I think it's very important. Here we show some Rosetta well data in those South areas compared to offsetting non-Rosetta data to the Southeast. I would point out that Rosetta wells are colored in light gray and have a lower condensate yield than our wells to the north, roughly 30 to 40 barrels per million compared to 50 barrels to 60 barrels per million in the North Central area, where Row 1 and Row 2 are located. However, as you continue to move Southeast, the non-Rosetta wells to the southeast have condensate yields much lower than in the range of about 5 to 20 barrels per million, which makes sense as you move down dip to the gassier parts of the play. The Rosetta light gray well data is made up of our 13 lower Eagle Ford wells that are located in our Southeast and far South type curve areas. As you can see, these are very productive wells.
10 of these wells have been online for quite some time. The other 3 wells are lower Eagle Ford wells that were part of our second upper Eagle Ford pilot, which I will talk about shortly, and have been online for less than 6 months. The average cumulative production from the 10 wells with more history is 963,000 barrels of oil equivalent. That is not EUR, that is already produced volumes. Six of the 10 wells have already produced more than 1 billion BOEs each and two 2 of the 10 wells have already produced more than 1.2 million BOEs each. They are prolific wells.
As you move to the Southeast off of our properties, the play gets deeper and enters the dry gas window. You can see the production of the non-Rosetta wells that we have plotted in red against our well performance in light gray. We have also plotted in blue what we believe to be a tighter 700-foot spacing pattern, and 1 on 500-foot spacing. Based on this range of data, it appears that the well performance of the tighter-spaced wells is in line with the well ranges in broader-space well spacing pattern. There could be other factors influencing this, but this is consistent with what we would expect in these very tight reservoirs. Again, the red and blue wells are not ours, and we only have public data; but the gray wells in the background are, indeed, Rosetta wells.
So what does all of this mean? It is our opinion that due to the extreme tightness of this rock, the stimulated rock volume is the primary driver behind drainage patterns. We see no production performance differentiation based on well spacing of 450 feet between wells. In other words, we believe that drainage patterns will be more function of the geography of the stimulated rock volume and its conductivity rather than the distance between offsetting wells and the respective matrix permeability. Sure, there has to be a limit to this; but right now, we do not believe that it is greater than 450 feet between wells.
Let's now move on and talk about our Upper Eagle Ford pilot programs. So please turn to Slide 10. The hypothesis a simple. In the thicker areas of the Eagle Ford is the Eagle Ford Austin Chalk, a stacked play hydrocarbon system with vertical permeability barriers that can offer unique reserves, and therefore, a unique investment opportunity, there are 2 questions we are trying to answer.
First, what is the performance and economics of an Upper Eagle Ford well? Second, do upper Eagle Ford wells interfere with and alter the performance of the lower Eagle Ford well? It takes historical technical data to answer both of these questions, and we are in the process of gathering it. We now have 4 upper Eagle Ford pilots, 3 in Gates Ranch and 1 on our L&E property in Central Dimmit County. Three of these 4 pilots are producing, and the fourth located on the third row east to Gates Ranch will be completed soon. The first pilot was a 3-well pilot, 1 upper well and 2 lower wells on the eastern side of Row 2 at Gates Ranch. This pilot was completed in May of last year, and has been on now for about 9 months.
The second pilot was a 5-well pilot, 2 upper wells and 3 lower wells in the southernmost portion of Gates. This pilot was completed in September of last year, and has been on for about 5 months. The third pilot was in Central Dimmit County on our L&E property. This 3-well pilot, 1 upper well and 2 lower wells, was completed in January of this year and has been on for only one month.
The fourth pilot is our largest, and it has 5 upper and 6 lower Eagle Ford wells. This pilot is located on the eastern side of Row 3 at Gates Ranch. The 5 upper wells are testing different landing intervals and/or different stimulation techniques. This pilot will be completed shortly.
On next quarter's call, look for us to show you our analysis of the data on both our second and first pilots. These thick Eagle Ford areas where we are pilot testing the Upper Eagle Ford, offer tremendous returns for our company and is important to us that we do not jeopardize those returns for the sake of additional inventory. In other words, we are looking for unique investment opportunities in the out Upper Eagle Ford, or compelling economics incrementally for the Upper Eagle Ford investment.
Let's now move to the Permian and talk specifically about our horizontal plans in that basin. So please turn to the Slide 11.
This Slide depicts the majority of our 41,000 net acre position in the Reeves County over in the Delaware Basin. The acreage in yellow is where we had a large working interest percentage, and therefore, we operated. The acreage in gray is where we own a working interest but it is less than 50% and we most likely will not operate.
We currently have 3 rigs drilling horizontal wells, as indicated on the map. The Gaucho 15-2H well was recently completed in December in the Upper Wolfcamp, and you can see from the initial production rate, we are very pleased with the results thus far.
You can also see we have a well shown in green and located directly south of the most western rig symbol, which has been recently drilled and completed and operations are under way. With this level of horizontal activity, we're on track to have 7 to 8 more operated horizontal completions over the next few months. Slide 12 in the slide deck shows our type curve that we are currently using for upper Wolfcamp wells in this portion of Reeves County. I look forward to keeping you guys informed on the results of our Delaware Basin horizontal activity as our completion, activities are increasing substantially. As always, I thank you for your interest in our operations and I look forward to updating you next quarter.
With that, I will turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, John. I hope our remarks this morning have provided additional insight on our 2013 results and our plans for 2014. We made significant progress during the past year and we are confidently executing on our future growth plans for our core assets in South Texas in the Permian Basin. Before we open the call for Q&A I would like to take this time to thank Rosetta's technical and business support teams who have done an exceptional job to play the huge part in our company's success over the past year. We are now 2 months into 2014 and well on our way to delivering another year of competitive growth. I'll now turn the call back to the moderator so that we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the Leo Mariani from RBC.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I know you had some pretty significant production interruptions in the fourth quarter. I was hoping you guys can maybe give us a little bit of color in terms of whether or not that's all behind ROSE at this point? And maybe give us kind of a sense of current production or where first quarter production might end up?
John E. Hagale
Hey Leo, this is John. Well, we don't give quarterly production guidance so I can't answer the second part of that. But we did, we brought on, as far as what we control, we've brought on a facility at Gates Ranch at that time had our largest concentration of wells going through, I think it was 22 wells that went through the facility. We had some startup issues with that. We've had tremendous runtimes on that as of late. So all that facility is producing and moving the volumes fine. We had an interruption that was the midstream during the quarter and although that hasn't totally been taken care of, we've re-routed our gas to other midstream providers so that's all flowing right now too. So we've had a pretty good run here as of late and -- like I said, I can't give you quarterly guidance because we don't do that. But all the issues that we had in the fourth quarter are behind us.
Leo P. Mariani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And I guess, you guys talked about I think roughly 4,000 barrels a day of production that was offline in the fourth quarter. Can you give us some color in terms of what the mix to that was? Was it largely oil or NGLs or gas? Can you help us out with that?
John E. Hagale
Yes, most all of that was associated with Gates Ranch production. So you can take our percentage mix for Gates Ranch and if you want to get more specific to it, it was in the far Eastern side of the north central type curves that we rolled out. So 20% oil, 37% NGLs.

Our next question comes from Amir Arif from Stifel.
Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Appreciate the color and the history in the Gates Ranch development. And it seems like condensate production is in line with what you're expecting, so I'm just curious if you can give us a little color on the 11 million downward revision that you had on the condensate yield, would -- whether it's just different locations you were planning on drilling? Or if its impact on the EURs and what kind of impact it might have on an NPV?
John E. Hagale
Amir, this is John. No, there were -- I hope I didn't mislead you on that. I think the point was when we had 16 wells across, let's say, an area that's 90 square miles. I know the Ranch doesn't encompass the entire 90 square miles. We made the call on what condensate yields would trend across the property. We are seeing in that northern part lower yields today than we saw 3 and 4 years ago when we had our delineation program going. So I don't want to mislead you on that. We're actually seeing though more history on the southern wells that are producing the condensate yields and the NGL yields are a little higher. The color I would provide we have an updated at the tight curves for 2.5 years, but we have been talking about condensate stabilization. So I'll give a little bit of color on that. We started when we started development of field condensate is the gravities that we're talking in those 55 to 60-degree range at Gates are somewhat volatile. We used to truck all of the condensate off the property. As the play developed and the play matured, midstream providers as they were getting more and more product through their lines, we as an operator, had to deliver a more stable product into those pipelines and there were pipeline specs that would lead us to have to either let them stabilize the condensate, kind of like a Coke bottle where you shake it up and let the carbon dioxide out of it, or we would do it ourselves in the field. So we have had a drop in our condensate yield associated with that. If not all of the drop that we have. As we've now got a 150 wells in the property, we have a lot more data set and we are seeing lower condensate yields in the North some of that is attributable to condensate stabilization, which is really if you look at, let's say, our new type curves, our percent oil, which is condensate in this area is down, you can also look at the corresponding percent NGLs, which is higher. So when you stabilize that condensate, you're really losing barrels of condensate, as you take the volatility out of it you're converting those back in the NGL barrels. If you do the math, it's not a total explanation of the entire 11 million barrels, but it falls into 2 categories. As a long-winded answer, but I think -- didn't want to mislead you on, we knew exactly what the condensate yields were for everywhere we drilled, I think we experienced some lower condensates in the North. But another chunk of that is the way we stabilize it now.
James E. Craddock
And then here I would just add to that, we get the question sometimes. Are you seeing declining condensate field across the field? And with the exception of kind of step change that we saw when we went to stabilization, our answer is "no" and the case in point we would point people to 9 5 discovery well, the oldest well in the field it's been on over 4.5 years, and when you go and look at condensate yield for that well, it's essentially the same as it was the first year that the well produced. So we're not seeing declining condensate yield.
Amir Arif - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division
Just a follow-up on that then, in terms of -- can you just tell us about how much of impact it is on a per well basis, the EUR, and then what kind of hit it does to the NPV?
James E. Craddock
The -- I'll talk a little bit -- I'll talk about the yield itself. I think we originally had the higher end of the Ranch that was mapped at 100, 105 barrels per million. We've got wells that are higher. But right now, we've got on average of the high-end of about 80 barrels per million. If you look at EUR, in the north, the old way we were doing it, we were having about 56% liquids. I think from an EUR standpoint, a little more than 300,000 barrels was condensate. Now we're looking at somewhere around 215,000 barrels on the NGL perspective. We were at about 470,000 barrels of NGLs and although our percentage is up, we're at about 400,000 barrels of NGLs. If you move to the South, the quite opposite comes into play. Prior to 2.5 years ago, when we had the data, we were estimating about 347,000 barrels of condensate for its percentage of the total EUR, about 665,000 barrels of NGL. So almost 1 million barrels of liquids on our old type curves. Now we've got 2.5 years more data. We're looking with a little more condensate on a total EUR recovery of about 365,000 on average and about 900,000 barrels of NGLs. So we're almost 1.3 million barrels of liquids that will be produced out of the South. So it's -- the opening comments of my historical data is pointing to some big, big broad area and I think it was said the other day that if you look at the P10, P90 distributions, you look at that ratio, it's still a pretty tight ratio, which tells you we are dealing with a very predictable asset, but it's just so large in size that the ranges will be quite large. So I hope that answered your question.

Our next question comes from Irene Haas from Wunderlich.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
So maybe kind of go back to be Reeves County in Texas Permian. Just kind of wondering how you're going to look for extra zone for 10%. But right now you're kind of focused on the upper Wolfcamp. At which point would you be pursuing sort of like the their Wolfcamp B and perhaps a second Bone Springs, can you give us a little color as to how your current year program is going to be divided?
John E. Hagale
Irene, this is John. We'll be talking about, I think, 7 to 8 completions here in the next couple of months as we drill and one of those of the 7 or 8 early on we've already drilled the well. But one of those will actually be in the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, the middle to lower portion of the Wolfcamp so we intentionally did not drill it in the upper Wolfcamp our technical teams they've mapped out every flow throughout the entire property from the Bone Springs down and so we will be coming forward with the test and something that's not the upper Wolfcamp here real shortly for you. And then for this year too we've also got on our drilling schedule some Bone Springs horizontals. That's in Reeves County which was kind of where your question was so this year we'll test real shortly we'll show you a test on middle-to-lower Wolfcamp and then throughout the year will be bringing you some data on the Bone Springs lateral. We also have, as a reminder, in the Northern Midland Basin, we've got a acreage up in Gaines County and that play is moving towards us up there, recently there is been some, at least from a permitting standpoint, some staking activity in and around the acreage that we have. So I'm not committing yet for us to drill a well up there this year but it's an area that's picking up in activity.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
Any interest in pursuing Pacos County?
John E. Hagale
It's a pretty big county and the reason I say that is there are parts of it, that I think are pretty good and then there's parts of it are busted up and water production is pretty high, so it's a pretty tricky county as you move to the south-southeast from where we are but there are some areas of it that I think we like in and there are some areas of it that we're scratching our head on why do the wells make so much water.
James E. Craddock
Irene, I would add to that, our acquisition guys are working in a number of different possibilities in terms of bolt-ons. What we really lack are bolt-ons bonds that are accretive to wells we already have in the inventory and so I'll point back to this 5,000-acre acquisition that we just did. Roughly 140 gross wells and about 70 of those we already had operatorship of and working interest in and we'd be drilling anyway, so we like both. We're going to continue to look at the opportunities in the area but really the true bolt-ons that can add and be accretive to wells we already see out there in inventory and add working interest we really like those.

Our next question comes from Michael Rowe from Tudor, Pickering.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
I guess, just real quickly back to the Eagle Ford. On the 11 million BOE write-down, how much of that was PDP related versus PUD related?
John E. Hagale
Michael, this is John. Most all of it was PDP related. Not all of it, but most all of it.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. Great. And just one follow-up would be I guess if you look at sort of how you view the Gates Ranch South now and sort of your implied returns actually looks superior to Gates Ranch North and economics look a little bit better than Coneal's [ph] prior expectation. So I guess I was just wondering given you've got a little bit more well control in the North, what kind of level of conviction do you have in sort of the EURs and the economics that have been revised for the Gates Ranch south area?
John E. Hagale
Yes, it's a great question. We were pretty convicted on our belief that we've got 13 wells, like I told you there 6 out of the 10 that have already produced nearly 1 million BOEs at themselves. So that the well productivity is definitely there and the distribution of outcomes are pretty tight. So the meat in the question goes well then, what's the right spacing. And we've got a strong conviction of these rocks will not -- rocks they will not flow through the matrix essentially at all. So our belief is stimulate a rock volume and the geometry of that defines the drainage patterns. So based on the work that we've done we believe that at 55 acres, we're sitting at a pretty good spacing of the volume of stimulated rock volume is at or less than that amount and then some of the pressure work data that we have done over the years aligns with that. It's not to say that there's not risk with that as you move into an area to the South because it's again, it's 9 miles across. But if you look at the far South, we do have a upper Eagle Ford pilot program and it was a pilot program that has 5 wells in it. There's 3 on the bottom and there's 2 on the top. The 3 on the bottom are actually spaced at about 55 acres if you just looked at the bottom. So some of the data we'll be bring forward with you guys to show you what we're seeing on the bottom so forth is also leads us to believe that he might be in the ballpark on spacing. Now those 3 wells have 2 wells right above them but that's the population. We've also got, if you look at our map, we have kind of in the central part of the 2 South area that's almost where the 2 curves overlap. We have 2 wells that were drilled. There some of our earlier wells, 1 is a 3 19, 1 is 4 19, they have different length laterals and the well performance that we see based on those spacing patterns we've yet to see interference and the difference in performances related to the number of stages that we've pumped on the different laterals. So the question you had is a very good question. Our conviction though is that drainage radiuses will be -- or drainage volumes will be parallel with the rock volume you stimulate, not how far you space wells apart.

And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Say, John, you had great details on the Gates Ranch development timeline going over that slide. I just want to make sure I understand that the great -- the material in pickup you've seen on that focus area EUR, one, is that just as you've moved further south and then can that continue? I mean certainly you've seen a material pickup '13 to '14. Was wondering just your thoughts going forward there.
John D. Clayton
I'm not sure I totally understand your question. So instead of eating in the 2 questions and getting cutoff. Can you repeat that one more time Neal.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
When I'm looking at outside 6, when I'm speaking specifically to where the focus of the EUR ranges. I'm looking at '13, you're at EUR 0.8 million to EUR 1.5 million and then it obviously jumps in '14 nicely to EUR 1.8 million to EUR 2.5 million. Just wondering again the reason behind that as that can continue to increase like that.
John D. Clayton
I got it now. If you look at that same slide, so we've got the wells that I just described to Michael. There's 2 wells, that are let's call it the third row, one the short, shorter laterals and then on the 5,000-foot laterals. We have the information on those 2 wells and then we have all the way to the almost the Eastern tip. We have that well too. So we have a better handle on -- now there's a couple of miles in between those wells with we have a better handle on what type of rock we will see in that southeast area that's bordered by those 3 wells. So it's not that we have a ton of data in the area, but we have the eastern and western boundary of the Southeast type curves that are defined by those 3 wells. It's different rock. The stuff falls off pretty quick. I mean, if you also look at the difference between our Row 2 going into what you're calling our next row, which is Row 3, which is the Southeast far south, we're forecasting some differences in well performance that I think would appear without the wells down there quite substantial but we do have wells that say this is what you should expect. But if you take it even further on that slide that I showed, as you move off of our acreage into an area that we don't operate with a lot of wells and you compare them background light gray well performance of what we have in the Southeast compared to what the non-Rosetta wells are showing further Southeast it's quite substantial difference on performance and I'm not sure that that's just because one operator is a lot better than the other or vice versa. It's this rock changes drastically as you move to the Southeast.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Great. And then one follow-up just moving over the Permian, looking at Reeves County at that Slide 12 maybe doing a little too granular but noticing that you've got a number of -- on that type curve, there's a number of gray, I guess, wells that were above that. I'm just wondering are those more of the recent wells then you've done a little bit some things different on those wells? Or I guess, is it fair to say, I guess, what I'm getting at, John, is sort of the decline on more of your recent wells? Have you seen the wells hold up a bit better than your very early wells over there?
John D. Clayton
No. It's another good question. It's more geographic. So if you look at we're in the phase now of trying to delineate the acreage position and see kind of what the range of outcomes are. So I wouldn't tell you we're doing anything a lot different to these wells and they're in exactly similar rock. I think it's more a function of, on average, they're probably several miles apart from each other and we're trying to understand the productivity of the rock that underlies it.

Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit BMO Capital Markets.
Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
If we could just turn to the balance sheet and the potential of accelerating the valued capture. Leverage sits below the class average today and as we have it modeled over the balance of 2014 and 2015, now that's a good thing. But is there a decision point this year based on well results from either horizontal Wolfcamp or upper Eagle Ford wells that you tap that liquidity to accelerate the value capture?
John E. Hagale
Dan, this is John Hagale. And what I would say is right now we kind of like the pace we are on. You've seen we ramped it up a little bit from where we were a year ago. And even though we're below the peer group I'd say we're at the upper end of our comfort level on those debt metrics. So I don't think all other things being equal you'd see us ramping that stuff up we've kind of given our best shot where we think capital is going to be this year and let us get through the year see how Reeves County looks. We think we've got pretty good feel for how the Eagle Ford looks. But I don't think you'd see us doing anything drastic on the capital side of things.
Dan McSpirit - BMO Capital Markets U.S.
Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, just turning to West Texas, can you refresh us on the location count in the Permian basin, in both vertical and horizontal locations? And how that might evolve through down spacing and greater testing of the acreage for horizontal well development recognizing, of course, that it's still early innings?
John D. Clayton
Dan, this is John. Yes, so, gosh, back when we first rolled out the acquisitions, we talked about we're going to value it on strictly vertical development and I think at that time, we had about 1,100 vertical locations and we said that was on 40-acre spacing. And if we could do some pilot testing on 20, we could double the well count on vertical. So that was, although it wasn't too long ago, it seemed like it was a really long time ago, so our technical team have been ripping apart the assets. We've had tremendous help from offset operators in the area drilling horizontal wells. So what we've done is -- we've, the economics that we believe the horizontal Wolfcamp offers us are higher than the vertical. So we put a priority on the horizontal inventory as we saw it throughout our acreage and we came up with, I'm going to give you net locations and I think our working interest average is about 70%. We came up with about 450 plus or minus net horizontal locations across our acreage and I think we have a slide on that somewhere that when we drill horizontal wells in some areas because we believe that the Wolfcamp was the main contributor to some of our vertical well inventory. We lost some of our vertical inventory. So I think today we're sitting at about 450-or-some-odd horizontal wells in inventory and about a little more than 500 vertical wells net remaining in our inventory. So although we're at the same thousand plus number of wells in inventory it's kind of apples and oranges compared to where we were just 8 months ago.

And our next question comes from Brian Gamble from Simmons & Company.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
The question back on your lovely Slide 6. The implication from that circle from the far South when you relate it then to Slide 7. Are some of the -- as we're calling it Row 2 wells falling into that far South type curve? Or is that exclusively the 2010, 2011 and then those 55-acre spacing wells including your 2 by 3 that you're talking. Are those the only wells that are in that curve?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Brian, this is John. No, so there's no Row 2 wells that are in the far south or southeast type curve. Now you can see the north central range is from about 0.8 million to 1.5 million. And some of the wells that are 1.5 million barrels wells start falling into the Row 2 so to speak because there are higher wells as you move further south. But the way we built the type curve and the distribution is on Slide #7 with the gray dots in the background are the 13 wells that are in the South.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Okay. But that included the 5 wells in the very far southwest corner?
John D. Clayton
It includes the lower Eagle Ford wells in that population. Not the 2 in the upper. There's 15 wells in the South. We've only included 13 and we've taken off the 2 upper and we'll show you guys next quarter.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Okay. That's a great. And then on the Permian side, you mentioned 7-day completions in the coming months. One of those being lower, I guess, multipart here, but the rest of those I would assume are in the same upper area that you've been drilling consistently since you started consistently being a couple of wells, but that's still the plan. And then related question is the Bone Springs later in '14, is that on the docket and where in the -- in your current footprint are you planning on doing that.
John D. Clayton
The first question is yes. One of the upcoming completions in that 7-day I mentioned will be a Wolfcamp BC horizontal well. That will give us some data. And then the Bones Springs area we've got several options to do. I'm not going to limit ourselves to just one well but the team is looking if you took probably the eastern 2/3 of our asset position that will be in that part and I'm not trying to be cute with the big area but the Bone Springs potential on about the eastern 2/3 of our acreage position is the area that we think offers the most upside.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brian Corales from Howard Weil.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Just a couple of questions. On the Eagle Ford, I know, I think in one of the prior calls you all talked about the development plan and how you need to get several wells ahead of in development to start completions. When do you see the point where you start completing more than you're drilling because that inventory continues to grow?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Brian, this is Clayton. We're sitting I think we're sitting at about maybe 60 right now and we've -- in the past we've been around 50. Every time we move into a new area and go full development we build an inventory ahead of us. So I would look for us to stay about where we are now for several more years and then once we start getting fully developed on these properties that are several years out just what you said will then be completing that inventory as we're completing the last set of properties. We're in development mode now this is what's changed from today with where we were in the past. We used to just be in development mode at Gates Ranch so we only needed an inventory ahead of the frac spread at Gates Ranch, but we're in full development mode right now at Briscoe. We're in development mode at Vivion and we're in development mode at L&E in our Central Dimmit property. So as we've gone into full development mode in additional areas, we had to build up those unique sets of inventory. But I'd look for us to sit at about where we are today which is about 60.
