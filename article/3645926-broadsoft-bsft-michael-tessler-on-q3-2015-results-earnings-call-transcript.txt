Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BroadSoft Q3 2015 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Kiang. Please, go ahead, sir.
John Kiang - Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Development
Thank you, Candice. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss BroadSoft's results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015. This call is also being broadcast live over the Web and can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the BroadSoft website at www.broadsoft.com.
With me on today's call are Michael Tessler, BroadSoft's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Tholen, BroadSoft's Chief Financial Officer.

Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, everyone. We are pleased that we delivered a strong third quarter in which we grew both revenue and billings by greater than 25% year-over-year. These financial results are due to great execution and our focus. I want to congratulate the entire BroadSoft team for their contributions in delivering them.
I also want to congratulate the team for just having completed our best and biggest Connections customer event ever last week. As a reminder, Connections is our Annual Users' Meeting where we gather key executives from our customers and partner community. Having so many industry luminaries and thought leaders together in the same forum leads to really interesting interactions, brainstorming, and planning discussions. In fact, several of our industry colleagues mentioned that this event has now become the seminal industry gathering. This morning, let me share with you what we announced and the reaction from our customers' community.
Every Connections is the theme that unites the whole event. This time, which was our 13th consecutive Connections, the theme was Define the Future. It's extremely appropriate for several reasons. The competitive landscape in enterprise communications and collaboration is undergoing rapid change. The demographics of the end user and how they want to use Unified Communications in the workplace is evolving. Furthermore, how these end users expect their Unified Communications Solutions to be delivered, essentially their buyer journey, is different as well.
This changing environment brings both challenges and opportunities to our service provider customer base. Our goal at this Connections event was to demonstrate how we, BroadSoft, as a trusted strategic partner, can help them navigate these changing market dynamics both today and well into the future.
But before we discuss how we will define the future of communications, let's look back for just a second at our very first Connections in 2003. That year we had fewer than 200 attendees and we were truly pioneers then, trying to evangelize a new approach of taking communications to the cloud at a time when the term cloud wasn't even in existence.
From those early days, fast forward back to today and it's clear to us that we're in a new era of communications. Now all networks are going IP. It's more than just voice. It's both real-time and near real-time. And very importantly, it's increasingly coming out of the cloud. What we now call hosted UC market is fast becoming mainstream.
I believe it's fair to say that we've been a key enabler of these changes in the marketplace. We were among the very first in the market. More importantly, we're still in the market leadership position today. As we announced in our press release during Connections, we now are at 12 million hosted business end users in the market. That's a huge number from where we started and an order of magnitude larger than our nearest competitor.
An important point is that these 12 million users drive significant value to our partners, the service providers. In fact, we estimate that our platforms drive over $4 billion of annual service revenue from our UC services, and we are still just at the beginning of transforming the enterprise communication industry.
So what drives this market leadership? It's a function of three factors. First is our partnership with our global network of service provider customers. In aggregate, this group, which spans over 90 countries and includes 26 of the top 30 service providers in the world, provides us an unrivalled global footprint and reach.
Second, in our continued investment in helping these service providers be successful. These investments include our recent creation of BroadSoft Design, which works with our customers to help them build differentiated and engaging user experience, optimized around how the user wants to buy and their overall buyer journey. They also include our go-to-market teams whose mandate is to work hand-in-hand with the carriers to design, launch, and fine-tune their UC offers.
The result of this go-to-market effort is that for Q3, we again had our highest level of sell-through ever for hosted seats. As another example of sell-through, we had one customer, Windstream, announce that they had surpassed 1 million SIP trunks based on our BroadSoft platform.
The third factor is our unwavering focus to drive innovation. At Connections, we announced a series of significant product and service innovations. Several addressed the end user experience, and others related to enhancements to our underlying platform.
Of particular note, we shared our achievements and plans regarding Network Function Virtualization, or NFV. NFV is increasingly important as our customers look to deploy our software in agile cloud architectures. A great example of our ongoing effort is the work we are doing with AT&T. AT&T has created a bold vision to move their infrastructure to cloud architecture by the year 2020, and we are very proud to be working with them as a partner in their Domain 2.0 projects.
Lastly, on the innovation front, I want to highlight our announcement of the interoperability of our UC-One client with Microsoft Skype for Business offering. This announcement demonstrates our continued commitment to build an unparalleled ecosystem of open, interoperable products and we're excited to announce that BT Wholesale will be launching a combined BroadSoft and Microsoft service to the U.K. market.
Now as we look into the future, we believe that the pace of change in our industry will only accelerate from here. To understand how true this is, you only need to look at Millennials in the workplace and how they communicate with each other using messaging and social media.
As this generation enters the workplace in even larger numbers, they will bring with them their own expectations of what a business communications experience should be. This acceleration in the rate of change is a big positive for BroadSoft. We will harness the same spirit of innovation that has made us the market leader since our inception to continue to propel us forward into the future.
To address tomorrow's UC opportunities, we need new solution that takes into account how the workforce is changing and how work is evolving. Internally, we refer to this as the future of work. As we define it, the future of work requires that people be able to communicate and collaborate with their colleagues, customers, and partners, and access the services required to be productive from any device on any network in any place.
Let me be specific on how we will address this. At Connections last week, we gave our customers a first look at how we plan to evolve the Unified Communications industry with an initiative we call Tempo. And the positive response we received from both our customers and industry analysts was a great validation of our efforts. At the highest level, Project Tempo is a new initiative based on UC-One that addresses a massive problem; bringing together various disjointed tools and off-the-shelf applications to make them all part of a seamless workflow. Tempo solved the issue of scattered communications, ineffective meetings, fragmented processes that decrease productivity and impede informed decision-making.
Imagine this; you wake up and you launch Tempo. It's already integrated with all the applications you currently use for work. Tempo tells you which meetings and messages are critical. You are able to access your team's communication and quickly respond through enterprise messaging. With more agile project management, you spend more time driving projects and less time chasing people and information. Lastly, you have in hand recent e-mails, communications, and social interactions that you need for a productive meeting or conversation.
The first product delivery of Tempo is expected to be in 2016 with the beta release of our UC-One Hub, a cloud service that integrates real-time communications with cloud applications. It also integrates contextual intelligence that helps users to be more efficient and productive. The beta will run on BroadSoft's UC-One Communicator, initially using Google Chrome and will feature off-the-shelf integrations with Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Concur, Redbooth, and Twitter.
It's important to note that all deliverables of Project Tempo leverage our service providers existing investment in BroadCloud and BroadWorks, and will further differentiate our solutions against others, which we believe will generate additional UC growth for us.
We posted a video on other content related to UC-One Hub and Project Tempo on our website at digital.broadsoft.com/tempo and I hope you'll take the time to go through there to watch it. I think it will make what we're doing much more tangible. We're very excited about this effort to define the future of communications and we'll continue to update you on our Project Tempo vision.
In summary, we had another strong quarter and exciting news that we shared at our Connections event. With that, let me now hand the call over to Jim, who will go through our results. Afterwards, I'll be happy to answer any questions. Jim?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. Here are the Q3 headlines.
Total revenue was $69 million, up 26% from the year ago quarter. Billings, which we define as revenue plus the net change in deferred revenue, were $71 million, up 25% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.36, versus $0.34 in the year ago period. Software license revenue was $31 million, up 22% year-over-year. Software license billings were $31 million, up 13% over a very strong Q3 last year.
We had another strong hosted UC quarter, led by order activity in Europe. Our subscription and maintenance support revenue was $30 million, up 22% year-over-year. Of that, maintenance support revenue of $21 million was up 20% year-over-year.
While we were delighted in this growth, there were some revenue recognition benefits in this result. Cloud SaaS revenue of $9.2 million grew from $6.9 million in the year ago period, and from $8.5 million in Q2 2015. We expect subscription and maintenance revenue to be up about $1 million or so as SaaS continues its Q3 trend into Q4 and maintenance support's growth moderates.
Professional services and other revenue of $8 million was up 67% year-over-year. Billings were over $14 million in the quarter. While we had suggested on our last call that we'd see PS revenue in Q3 of over $10 million, delays in a couple of projects pushed this revenue into Q4. We believe that Q4 that we'll reach a number of PS-related revenue recognition milestones that should lead to revenue in excess of $12 million.
Now, moving on to costs and margins; in Q3, we had gross margin of 74%, down from 75% in Q2 and 76% in the year ago quarter. Gross margin for software and subscription and maintenance support, both improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The impact on Q3 margins was primarily driven by our PS business, which was essentially zero margin, as costs ramped to $8 million from $6 million in Q2.
As I mentioned, we actually billed over $14 million worth of PS in the quarter, so we had a lot of activity in the quarter, for some of which we had to defer revenue. There were also a couple of factors here for the sequential expense increase. First, as we previewed on our last call, in Q3 we shipped over $1 million worth of hardware to a large customer as part of a transformation project. While we expensed the cost of this hardware, we have yet to receive acceptance on the project and so haven't recognized the revenue.
Second, we had a full quarter's worth of BroadSoft Design expenses. For Q4, given our expectations in PS revenue, I believe we could see PS margins in the 50% range. For the company overall, we believe the total cost of sales will be down about $500,000 to $1 million as the negative impact from hardware shipments goes away and other cost of sales are essentially flat to up just a bit.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $39 million and operating margin was 17% versus 20% a year ago. Operating expenses were up $1.7 million sequentially over Q2 with the primary drivers being a full quarter of BroadSoft Design and other investments in our business. Q4 is our seasonally highest from a OpEx perspective and includes costs related to our Connections event and sales accelerators. For Q4 we estimate that OpEx will increase in the $3 million ZIP code versus Q3.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $329 million at the end of the third quarter. The large increase from Q2 is due to the convertible debt financing that we did in September when we raised $201 million. Accounts receivable of $102 million, were up from $91 million in Q2 with our continued billings strength. Deferred revenue was up $2 million from Q2 to $110 million.
I want to make a few comments on the convert. We believe this was an attractive, pragmatic, and opportunistic corporate finance move on our part. We increased our cash balance by a net $116 million after using about $25 million for stock buyback and about $53 million for the repurchase of a portion of our 2018 convertible notes.
Our primary goals of the transaction were, one, address our near-term financing needs associated with the $120 million outstanding of the 218 (sic) [2018] notes, and, two, lock in capital for the next seven years at very attractive rates. We think the 1% coupon of the note is a great outcome, especially in the context of an increasingly uncertain interest rate environment ahead.
Finally, these notes were structured to have a very low dilutive impact. We expect there would be essentially zero dilutive impact from the principal amount of the convertible notes. We expect we would pay the principal amount back at maturity in cash. The dilution math, assuming our stock price exceeds the conversion price, is similarly attractive. Dilution would be limited to only the net amount that our stock price would be above the conversion price.
Now, on to guidance; we expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $78 million to $84 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.74. For the year, we now expect 2015 revenue in the range of $267 million to $273 million. Full year EPS is now in the range of $1.50 to $1.66.
I'd also like to say a few words about our initial expectations for 2016. We're still in the middle of our budgeting process, so as normal, we'll provide detailed guidance for next year in our Q4 earnings call. From where we stand now, our planning expectations are for top line in earnings growth in the 20%-plus range from the midpoint of our 2015 guidance.
We believe we are at an early stage in a remarkable market opportunity, for which we hold a significant market leadership position. With those guiding premises, we want to make sure we invest in this opportunity for the long-term, while balancing those investments with appropriate margin ambitions.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, can you please open the call?

And our first question comes from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could give a little more color on your engagement with AT&T. That's a pretty big deal. If you could just give us a sense of where you are in that engagement? Are you in the professional services state? Are you actually getting license revenue? And any other color on how you're working with them, whether it's sort of their own cloud hosting, or if you're hosting it? Any color on that would be great. Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Rich, unfortunately, as you know, a lot of our customers are extremely reluctant for us to talk about where we are in the project. This is about all I can share. This is what we've been given to â that's okay with AT&T to talk about. So you'll have to wait a little longer before we can kind of get into any more details and have AT&T's permission.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Rich, I can confirm though that we are actively billing, so it's definitely a major project for us.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got you. And then, Jim, with respect to your receivables, they went up again quarterly and I think they're at an all-time high, at least as far as I looked back. Is there something structurally going on with the business that's leading to these higher DSOs and do we think they keep going up or at some point do they start trending down again?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So first they are at a historical high. We essentially have no bad debt expense. The credit for our customers is obviously very high too. Things are driving the DSOs in the quarter, one is just it was a big billings quarter, which is a good thing, but, the billings tended to land late in the quarter, so AR is high.
And then the second was on balance more international versus U.S. from a billings activity standpoint. As I noted in the script, Europe really led the charge and they â internationally it just tends to be longer payment cycles. I suspect, to be honest, Q4 will be in a similar range just because of the magnitude of our Q4s and then we'll start bringing it back down as we get into next year.
Richard F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
All right. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
...taking my question. A couple of questions; first on Project Tempo, Mike, to what degree are the capabilities commercially available today or soon and to what degree is this more of a vision that is kind of going to be affecting your roadmap over the next couple of years?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, we announced that the Project Tempo is, imagine that as an initiative, focused on really looking at how to â the primary focus and the design focus we have with our team now is how do we make our end users more effective, productive? How do we help them collaborate? So there's a set of design principles that we are focused on with Project Tempo, trying to understand how we shift from voice, video, text messaging, all these functions, to what we call workflow.
So how do we make setting up a meeting complicated and take a lot of time to something that can be done very quickly? How can we set up a video call instantly when I walk in a room versus trying to find the one guy who knows how to set up the video call? So we're looking at these workflows and that's the â imagine that's the guiding principles of Project Tempo.
And then, as I mentioned in the script and what we announced at Connections is that the first product realization is something called UC-One Hub, where we integrate a set of applications and context into the UC-One experience, and that the plan is to go from beta to release in 2016. We haven't set the exact dates for that.
And again, that would be again if you imagine in the demos, the prototype demos we showed would be things like from within your UC-One client, instead of having to go out of contacts to a proven expense report, that expense report information, that approval would come right inside your UC-One client and you'd be able to approve it directly. So you don't have to switch contacts into another environment; very simple example. We also have contacts, which is bringing out of your e-mail and your social media any interactions that you and I might have over the last period, any files we might have exchanged, and again have all those immediately available to us in the UC-One client.
So our goal is to â as I said, Tempo has these very large goals and objectives, and the way we â and then the first deliverable is this UC-One Hub, and our plan would be to go from beta to a release of that in 2016, but we haven't nailed down the dates yet.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And I presume these will be available, the UC-One Hub available, BroadWorks and BroadCloud. And then also if you could comment on I think in the past, sometimes when you've added functionality, it's been through small tuck-in acquisitions. Is that something we should continue to look for going forward, or will this be generally an internally developed solution?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, yes. So to answer the first question, it will be available both on BroadWorks and BroadCloud. We like to describe it as really a â the goals of Project Tempo was to leverage the UC-One platform and whether that's a software deployment or a cloud deployment, independent of that. And also the first service, which we call the Hub, is also a cloud service, so it's something we're running on behalf of our carrier community. So that's the first part.
I think it's too early to tell whether or not we will look at some tuck-ins. I think safe to say that probably the Hub stuff is already in the works. The larger Project Tempo objectives might drive some small tuck-in M&A, still yet to be determined.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Your line is now open.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Oh, hi, Mike, could you talk a little bit about Microsoft? I know that there was an announcement they made that they'd really like to be their own CLEC internationally and domestically. And pretty much do you see them on the carrier side in the large enterprise, the mid-sized enterprise? Are they really a carrier customer, and should we worry about them and where they are headed? Thank you.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Catharine, I think Microsoft positioning is quite clear. And I think the carriers that we've spoken to, prior to Connections and especially at Connections, the clarity has become that Microsoft has decided to become its own global carrier for Unified Communications and look to compete with their existing channels, some of those which are our service providers today.
And so, I think, generally, the dynamics have changed quite a bit in our customer base, the service provider base. And I think they see Microsoft as a clear competitor. It's fairly well-known that Microsoft is trying to acquire interconnect from a number of carriers around the world, so they can start to build out their global network and be able to provide PSD and breakout. And so the Microsoft motives are pretty clear.
I think the other positive that Microsoft has done is they have communicated to the marketplace that they really believe that the future of Unified Communications is cloud, because they've really kind of moved away from link, what I would call link premise, to Skype for Business Online. And so I think that the battle lines between Microsoft go direct to the carriers, global carrier solution, and our service provider base is now clear.
I think a lot of the carriers have been asking us to help them figure out how to compete more effectively with that Microsoft solution. Microsoft has some challenges to go from where they are to being a global service provider, and so I think they have a fair amount of execution challenges going forward. But as we all recognize, Microsoft does have a very strong footprint on the desktop. So, we have to help our service provider customers compete with Microsoft.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Got it. And congratulations on the Domain 2 win; very nice. Thank you.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. And our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I was really interested in the whole discussion around UC-One Hub and Project Tempo. I guess I'd love to better understand how you see the competitive environment there? I mean there are companies out there like Slack, which are generating a lot of progress in the enterprise right now in terms of adoption. And it sounds like many of the features you're talking about in this offering overlap for example with Slack. And how do you see kind of your timing to market and your channel, and how it all kind of boils up against the other offerings that are out in the marketplace?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, I think one of the things that â I think the thing that we communicated to our carrier community last week at Connections was that it's clear that as an enterprise end user, you can go out and you can select a fair number of individual applications to help with productivity, whether that's meeting setup, contact management. There's a hundreds of little apps out there. And some reach scale in terms of enterprise messaging, like you mentioned Slack.
And what we're trying to do is basically integrate as much of that capability into a bundled offer and be realistic. When we look at all these applications, it's unrealistic that you can imagine that enterprise buyers will spend hundreds of dollars in this assortment of applications and integrations and that they're going to look for a more integrated, bundled offering. And I think that's our view.
So I think when we say the combination of our channel, which is the service provider marketplace, massive channel global, we're not looking to be first to market in every new app. What we want to do is we want to basically create a very highly integrated, highly bundled offer that our service providers can take to market in the kind of the mass market part of the transition of the market. And so that's what we're going after.
And I think lots of companies get a lot of excitement in the beginning parts of markets. Our channel are the guys that pick up the big chunk of the market once the market is established, and that's how we see Project Tempo and some of the capabilities that we're going to build inside UC-One.
George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then just as a follow-on to that, how do you see yourself pricing that? How do you see â I guess I look at the traditional services that BroadSoft has I guess enabled sort of on the UC side, SIP Trunking side, more of this is going into the cloud with BroadCloud. I mean is it fair to say that on a per seat basis, you could get significantly more for a seat that's tied to these services, or am I not thinking about it the right way? Is it not a seat-based sale for you?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think, first of all, I think the big driver for us is we do believe it can increase the seat price, but I think the big relevance here for us is increasing the stickiness and increasing the sell-through rates. And I think that we still haven't exactly figured out the pricing model for the first components, but I think that for us it's about the number of total UC-One seats out there, and we think over time less and less about monetizing every little kind of separate item.
I think â we have to compete. We have to have a very strong, fully bundled offer that ensures that the end user has a really great experience; that is intuitive, is easy to use, that people find extremely productive, and that our service providers find easy to sell. And ultimately that's the most important part of the messaging. But more to come on how we plan to monetize some of the Project Tempo elements.
George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks. Guys, can you hear me? I apologize for the background noise.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I can hear you.
Paul J. Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Yes. So a couple of quick questions; one, can you update us, give us any color on the network transformation projects? Are there any new wins? How many projects are still out there remaining to be awarded? Any additional color would be great. Question on pricing, any change in the pricing environment? And if you can also address the competitive landscape, what you're seeing? Thanks a lot.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, Paul, no transformation projects to announce this quarter. These are big projects. Obviously, Mike mentioned AT&T in particular in the opening remarks, and those transformation projects continue to drive our business. I would say anecdotally pipeline and near-term pipeline looks great, but these really are very, very large projects.
Pricing environment, and it's a little bit of a follow-on on George's question as well, I'd say that pricing into the service providers continues to be â essentially our price realization, we've been able to maintain our price realization over time, including now; so no change in that environment. We are seeing, in our price conversations with carriers, an absolute willingness to be effectively have two prices; one is called BroadWorks Classic and then the second is a bundle with these Unified Communications elements, which I think has a price benefit over time as we get higher UC adoption. And I'll hand over to Mike for the competitive commentary.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Thanks, Jim. I think that we obviously look at competition from two lenses, Paul. The first one is those that look to supply or distribute through our partners. And by and large that has been, really, kind of a race of three, which is really us, Cisco and Microsoft. I think Microsoft has very clearly identified itself as not interested in continuing those relationships. And I think the carriers are looking for ways to replace that, those efforts around Microsoft. And that's a lot of the discussions we've had in the last few months, and especially at Connections, around how to help them compete with Microsoft.
I think on the Cisco front, I'd say that it's been â we've seen fair amount of inactivity from the Cisco guys into the service provider space. I think most of our carriers and the feedback we've gotten from them is they expect Cisco to take a similar stance and become more competitive with their own direct-to-end market cloud offering. And so I think that, net-net, we're seeing a lot of really good attention from the carriers. And because we've been a really trusted strategic partner to that community I think we're getting lots of interest, lots of focus on broadening our relationships with our global partners.
I think in the â if you look at the competition, once our carriers go into the market to sell, I think that one is that the market is growing. The overall hosted UCaaS market is growing. End users more and more are looking to buy this as a cloud offering, so all boats are rising. I think you see the legacy players scrambling around, lots of M&A activity, and yesterday was no exception to that.
There seems to be a fair amount of M&A activity around the legacy players who are somewhat kind of scrambling to figure out what to do, can they go cloud? Can they compete? Do they have enough distribution? Do they have enough scale? And I think that that's certainly causing some pretty significant changes in the marketplace. So we see less competition from the traditional players, and I think we've said for quite some time, I think the race becomes us through service providers against Microsoft and Cisco.

Mike, can I ask you to specifically comment on (39:55) communities?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I mean I think as I've said before, I think both â the market especially in the U.S., the UCaaS market is extremely brisk. It's extremely popular. It's the way people want to buy. I think they're doing a good job in growing their market share. I think, like I said, all boats rise with a good market. I think we also have to realize, I think some people forget is, our business model isn't the same as either of those companies. We're an enabler to companies that compete with them, companies like Vonage or companies like AT&T, we mentioned, Verizon, et cetera. So we have a slightly different business model.
We've decided for a long time to be strategically aligned with the carriers. We believe that in the end they will have the most effective cost of acquisition. They will eventually result in a much bigger business through that distribution army that they have. And that's why we've made that bet, but our business models are â there's a retail model and if you want to put a quick wrapper on our model, ours is a wholesale model. So I think we have slightly different models. We both benefit from the growing adoption of Unified Communications as a Service market.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions; first, can you give us the geographic breakdown to maybe comment on what you saw in Asia? I think that was a little weaker last quarter, did that bounce back as expected?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, yes, the quarter was really led by Europe, North America was fine. Emerging markets, including APAC, did bounce back from a softer Q2. So it was good activity worldwide. Europe was strongest this quarter.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then can you help us understand how much of the strength you experienced this past quarter was driven by hosted UC opportunities versus Trunking versus contribution from network transformation deals, and given we've now seen several strong hosted quarters, is the Q4 guide any more dependent on large project revenue relative to a typical Q4?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, the quarter was definitely driven by hosted UC. But that to me includes these transformation projects, which are by and large hosted, just on a much bigger scale. And it was a mix of both. Certainly, there was a lot of billing activity and revenue activity in the quarter on the transformation projects, but there was, just the core, call it turn-the-crank hosted business was very strong. We actually had growth in Trunking, which was good to see. But it certainly lagged overall growth.
And when I think Q4, there's definitely dependencies in the guide on hitting acceptance and milestones on some of these larger projects. I think we're pretty balanced in how we incorporate that into our guidance. But there's absolutely, dependence on getting delivery on some of these large projects for the quarter.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And as we look into 2016, can you help us understand how we should be thinking about linearity, and to what degree we should expect the year to be more weighted towards the back half?
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I mean again, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're still in the process of working our 2016. I think from where I sit now, I would imagine the year would look reasonably similar to this year where you â the Q1's a pretty sizable step down from Q4 of the prior year, and Q4, we tend to be very second half and particularly Q4 weighted.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Last one for me just on the Professional services side, it seems like the project you had expected to start in Q3 maybe got pushed out a little bit. Has that started at this point in time? And how much visibility do you have to that coming through in Q4? Thanks.
James A. Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And just to be clear, it was less a project starting in Q3 than we had expected to hit a couple of these revenue recognition milestones in Q3, and on a couple of projects it did slip into Q4. It is part of the Q4 guide, but one of the reasons we think that Q4 PS number will be higher. The billings for PS in Q3 was north of $14 million, so clearly a ton of PS activity. And again, we're expecting quite a bit of that to come in off the balance sheet in Q4, but yes, no delay in starting. It was a little bit of a slip in getting final acceptance.
