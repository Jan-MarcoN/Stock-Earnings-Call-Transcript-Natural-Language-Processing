Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IMS Health Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 27, 2016.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Thomas Kinsley - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Planning
Thank you, Tanya. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today, we will be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following the call on our Events & Presentations section of our Investor Relations website. A link to the IR website is located in the lower right-hand corner of the landing page for imshealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance, our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, July 27, 2016.
Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are, in fact, achieved will depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company.
Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
During this presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, unlevered free cash flow and gross leverage ratio. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance.
In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends on a more consistent basis from period-to-period because they exclude certain non-cash items, certain variable cost and certain other adjustments. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. While the IMS team was very active during the second quarter, we announced the Quintiles IMS game-changing merger and we are in full integration planning mode, working hard towards closing the deal.
The more we work with our peers at Quintiles, the more excited we are about the rationale for bringing these two companies together and all the opportunities that lie ahead. And of course, we continued to manage the business tightly, delivering on our financial commitments with results that were in line with or better than our expectations.
Second quarter revenue grew 8.5% at constant currency, at the higher end of our guidance range. Tech services revenue was up 14%, and info revenue 2.5% at constant currency.
Adjusted EBITDA growth was 7% at constant currency and above our guidance range. Emerging markets grew 11% and developed markets about 8% before the impact of FX. For the first time in quite a while actually FX had a negligible impact on revenue and was actually slightly favorable to adjusted EBITDA. At actual FX rates, revenue was 8% up ,and adjusted EBITDA was also 8% up.
Before turning the call over to Ron to provide more detail on our results, I thought you would appreciate a brief update on our pending merger with Quintiles. I've spent a lot of time on the road together with my good friend, Tom Pike, at Quintiles meeting with many of you to review the rationale for the deal and the opportunities ahead.
We're well advanced in our integration planning process and we look to hit the ground running when the deal closes. Operationally, we continue to see great opportunities to do things more efficiently together.
On the growth side, one of the more intense areas of integration activity has been the smart CRO, the enabling of clinical trial services offerings with powerful IMS data. Teams from IMS and Quintiles eagerly await the closing so they can put their plans into action.
Our pre-existing collaboration with Quintiles and Real-World Evidence continues to see success in the marketplace. In fact, we just won a significant multiyear deal with a top 20 pharma client where we will rollout an Evidence platform to shape oncology treatment patterns and measure outcomes. The client will leverage the combined capabilities of IMS and Quintiles, as we integrate our technology stack and data assets with Quintiles' deep clinical expertise.
In late June, we passed the waiting period for Hart-Scott-Rodino review in the U.S. and have therefore cleared that hurdle. We've also completed our initial regulatory filings in Europe and all other countries where we are obliged to file.
You saw that the initial filing of the S-4 occurred in early June. We're working through the steps required to finalize this document and put the merger to a vote of our shareholders. Given where we stand in the process, we now expect to close this deal early in Q4.
With that, let me turn you over to Ron Bruehlman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to take you through the financials in more detail.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, Q2 was another solid quarter for IMS. We build upon our strong start for the year in Q1. So let's review the details.
Our revenue in the second quarter increased 8.4% on a constant currency basis with information offerings growing 2.6%, while technology service offerings increased 14.3%. We saw particularly strong growth in workflow analytics and technology and application.
As you're aware, April 1 marked the anniversary of our Cegedim acquisition, so we'll no longer highlight Cegedim's contribution to our quarterly revenue growth as it is now fully in the prior-year base. Since Cegedim revenue is now entirely in the base numbers, I want to remind you that when we announced the acquisition some time ago we told you that the acquired business included a legacy set of offerings such as on-premise CRM that comprised about a quarter of the business at the time and where revenue was declining by more than 20% annually. This declining legacy portion of the Cegedim business, which is being phased out, represented a drag of over two points on our technology services revenue growth in the quarter and more than one point on our overall revenue growth.
Said differently, if you exclude this legacy portion of the Cegedim business that is being phased out, tech services growth in the quarter would have been two points higher and overall revenue growth would have been one point higher.
On a reported basis, revenue grew 8.1% during the quarter with technology services revenue up 13.8% and information revenue growing 2.5%. By geography, developed markets grew 7.9%, emerging markets 11% at constant currency during the quarter. At actual currency, developed markets grew 8.7% and emerging markets 5.4%. The reported revenue growth in developed markets was higher than that at constant currency due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the euro against the dollar. On the other hand, emerging markets reported revenue growth was substantially below the constant currency growth due to weakening of several currencies including the Brazilian real, the Chinese Yuan, the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.
And now turning to profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $238 million for the quarter increasing 6.7% constant currency and 8.1% reported. Moving down the P&L, GAAP net income was $24 million during Q2 compared with $47 million last year. And the decline was primarily attributable to higher restructuring charges this year. These charges were due principally to our restructuring plan in France relating to the integration of a substantial Cegedim business there.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.07 in the second quarter compared with $0.14 in Q2 2015. Adjusted net income of $139 million was up 15.7% on a constant currency basis driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA and lower cash taxes. On a reported basis, second quarter adjusted net income increased 10.7%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.41 in the second quarter, an increase of 17.3% at constant currency and 12.2% at actual currency.
Growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS was lower at actual currency than at constant currency due to the impact of our foreign currency hedges, which generated a fairly substantial gain in last year's second quarter as currencies moved against us then and small loss this year as currencies began moving back in our favor.
And as a reminder, we hedge in two ways. First, through forward contracts on the foreign currency royalties paid by our foreign entities to the U.S., and secondly via our euro-denominated interest expense, which acts as a natural hedge of our euro-denominated earnings. And just a reminder that these impacts of the hedges flow through the P&L below the EBITDA so they're reflected in adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS but not in revenue or adjusted EBITDA.
Now let's look at the first half results. First half revenue was almost $1.6 billion, representing an increase of 16.1% at constant currency. Tech services offerings grew 27.8% and information offerings were up 5.7%, again both at constant currencies.
Now on a reported basis, revenue grew 14.7% during the first half with technology services up 26.6% and the information up 4.2%.
Of course, as you know, the first half of 2015 includes an additional quarter of Cegedim in the first quarter results, as this acquisition closed on April 1, 2015. Excluding this additional quarter, revenue growth for the first half was 8.6% with technology services offerings expanding 16.5% and information offerings up 1.5%.
At constant currency, developed markets grew 15.6% and emerging markets 18.7% during the first half. At actual currency, developed markets grew 15.4%, emerging markets 11.3%. Excluding the additional quarter of the Cegedim acquisition, those growth rates at constant currency were 8.3% in developed markets and 10.9% emerging markets.
Adjusted EBITDA for the first half was $474 million, up 8.7% reported and 8% at constant currency. Adjusted net income of $279 million increased 6.8% reported and 10.9% at constant currency. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.83 in the first half, up 9.1% at actual FX rates and 13.2% at constant currency.
Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At June 30, cash and cash equivalents totaled $368 million and debt was $4.6 billion, resulting in net debt of $4.2 billion. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.9 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, and this compares to 4.8 times at the end of last year. Net of cash, our leverage ratio ended the half at 4.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
Cash flow from operating activities was $111 million in the second quarter compared with an unusually strong $186 million in the second quarter of 2015. And the difference was principally timing-related, reflecting growth in accounts receivable and also cash outflows related to the loyalty card programs that IMS administers on behalf of its pharmaceutical customers. And this compared to significant inflows in the loyalty card payments last year.
And we've mentioned this on prior calls, but it's worth repeating. The inflows and outflows associated with these loyalty card programs can bounce around quite meaningfully from quarter to quarter, but they do tend to balance out over the course of the year.
Capital expenditures and additions to deferred software of $53 million increased $7 million versus the second quarter of 2015. And our unlevered free cash flow for the second quarter was $153 million, which represented a drop through of 64% of adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter, we spent $25 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our common stock.
While we expect to close on the merger with Quintiles early in Q4, we understand you're still interested in how the legacy IMS business will perform for the balance of the year. So let me give you some guidance there.
For the full year, we're reaffirming our constant currency guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which is for revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5% to 9.5%. We're increasing full year constant currency guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS, each by 1.5 point of growth. Adjusted net income growth is now expected to be 8% to 10%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth is now expected to be 10% to 12%.
We're also increasing our full year reported guidance. Assuming current FX rates hold for the balance of the year, our full year reported guidance is now for revenue growth of 10% to 12% or one point higher than our previous guidance, adjusted EBITDA growth of 8.5% to 10.5%, also one point higher than our previous guidance, adjusted net income growth of 5% to 7% or three points higher, and adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 9% or three point higher than our prior guidance.
I'll give you some help for the third quarter also. We're providing constant currency guidance for revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted net income growth flat to 1%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1.5% to 2.5%.
While on a reported basis, that is assuming current FX rates hold for the balance of the quarter, our third-quarter guidance is for revenue growth of 8% to 9%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% to 9%, adjusted net income decline of 1% to 2%, and adjusted EPS decline of 0.5% to 1.5%. A growth in the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS is substantially lower than that of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, principally due to the timing of foreign cash tax payment and slightly higher interest expense.
In summary, we had a solid quarter. Revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA growth was above our guidance range. We continued the momentum in our technology services business, where revenue growth once again was in the double digits. At constant currency, we're reaffirming our full-year guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and increasing our full-year guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. Finally, at actual currency, we're increasing our full-year guidance for all four of our financial metrics.
I'll close by saying that the more work we do with our soon to be colleagues at Quintiles, the more excited we are about the merger. Integration planning is progressing rapidly and we continue to move towards an early fourth quarter close date.
So with that, I'll ask the operator to please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

And our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Please proceed.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Thanks very much. Ron, can you just give us a sense about what acquisitions contributed to revenue growth in the quarter?
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. Look, let me give you a little bit more detail on that. As you know, most of the acquisitions that we make are in tech services. Our tech services revenue grew over 14% for the quarter at constant currency. And as I explained, about two points of drag was included in that number from the Cegedim legacy businesses. So if you adjust for that, tech services growth was about 16%.
Now all of our acquisitions including AlphaImpactRx represented about half of that growth. So our tech services organic revenue growth, and that's where most of the acquisitions were within our normal kind of high-single-digit range. And from that, I think you can kind of surmise where our overall organic growth is.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. And then two other quick ones. Thank you. Your underlying data cost as a percent of your cost structure -- any interesting trends there? Would you say they're stable, going up or going down as a percent of revenue? And I think in the past you've talked about investing in biologic and specialty coverage. Can you give us an update on where you stand there and maybe sort of what your script coverage is for biologics at this point? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Hi, John, this is Ari. Yeah, as we've said in the past, our investments in specialty biologics to increase the coverage is ongoing and we have been increasing our investments there, overall. However, there is a long tail of other data around the world. We continue to manage costs more effectively. So in aggregate, our overall (21:03) costs are actually flat.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Flat on a dollar basis or flat as a percent of revenue?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Percent of revenue.
John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks much.

And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Could you give us the acquisition revenue contribution in the second half guide with AlphaImpact and all the tuck-ins already done and has this changed over the last quarter?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No. Just â Andrew, really we see our organic growth rates remaining exactly as we have been delivering them. Overall, for the company it's in the 4% to 5% range organically and for tech services it's in the high-single digits. Again, as you know it's going to be bouncing around the 8-ish percent kind of range â 8% to 9%.
We don't see anything changing in the second half. Obviously, our reported number is higher than our usual low-double digit on tech services and as you pointed out that's the benefit of the AlphaImpactRx in particular. AlphaImpactRx adds on a quarterly basis (22:27) rounded up to a couple of points of our tech services and then you've got the other acquisitions. Again, as you know, we did quite a bit last year. And so that's going to get another two or three points or so. So that brings you down to the high-single digit tech service. Again, we don't see any difference in the second half. It's been, again, very, very consistent.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And have there been more acquisition since May?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Actually, no.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Maybe one small one I'm being told.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
One or two small ones. Nothing that that would add significantly to revenue, Andrew, no, nothing yet.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Its only one actually, the Privacy Analytics which we talked about.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And it's mostly technology and proprietary advanced Privacy Analytics at the very time. So, actually we've been very busy as you can imagine with the Quintiles merger/integration planning. And I think we do, as always, have a pipeline of acquisitions. But I think you'll see in the numbers reported that â I mean, our filing that we haven't done really much in acquisitions. And nothing is planned of significance in the balance of the year either.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And could you just talk about the Cegedim integration, how that's going? You really only mentioned the legacy business.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We are, hopefully, in the back-end of that full integration efforts. I think things have gone very well in most areas of the world, probably I would say, ahead of what we had anticipated. On the other hand, France has been an issue, mostly our social plan. They had to go through a number of loops. But the good news is we just now gotten all of that signed up and the last charge that you see in the second quarter is associated with the significant restructuring that we are now going to be able to implement in France. I think the first people out are going to be in September. So in that sense, we are a little late on the French front, better on the rest. We still for 2016 hoping to come in at least exiting 2016 with a $25 million of bagged cost synergies. And for 2017, we still expect the run rate at the end of 2017 of $60 million as we have communicated with you before. So, again, overall, we are exactly on target with as you can imagine for a global business a lot of moving parts.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Makes sense.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Info grew about 2.6% constant currency this quarter, which was the best result since I think first quarter of 2015. So I just wanted to know if you could give us a little color on what drove the strong result there and related, just how the ad-hoc business in info is doing.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Thank you, Toni. We've always said and we cannot say it enough, it's always hard to box our business in neat quarters. And we've said before that our info growth rate will remain in the low-single digits. That's just the nature of the business, the fact that we have the market share that we have and our strategic decision to grow in tech services. And so our midterm guidance remains unchanged for info to grow annually in the low-single digits which means 0% to 2%.
Occasionally, quarter-by-quarter, that rate will bounce around outside that 0% to 2% range. The quarter you referred to, I think the first quarter of 2015 was I think 3%. We said then and I will say the same now, not to draw conclusions on significant changes or fundamental changes or shift in our info business. Similarly, if a given quarter it's zero or less, we strongly recommend not to derive strong conclusion. The ad-hoc business, you are right, is a driver and it was fairly good this quarter. I think nothing out of the ordinary. There are quarters again where we have a little bit more and quarters where we have a little bit less and this quarter we had a little bit more. So you are correct in your analysis but, again, I caution again deriving any conclusions in terms of fundamental changes. It will bounce around.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then are there any major CRM contracts coming up for renewal in 2016 or 2017 that we should be aware of that could just make the business a little bit lumpy?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, first of all, these things â even if there were which we don't anticipate any major wins or losses, it takes time for those to flow into our numbers. So when we announced a major win on the CRM side, you're not going to see the numbers until the following 18 months. No, it takes time to implement.
(28:24) coming back on gross margins, due to the implementation upfront work, but not so much disruption on revenues. In terms of upcoming major contract, yes, there has been a part â some part of the business come up for renewal I think in France, or some European countries with Sanofi, sometime in 2017, sometime in the second quarter of 2017. No other major renewals that I am aware of.
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Toni, and its worth mentioning again that the CRM business represents 5% or 6% of our overall business, and obviously post-merger that's going to be a much smaller percentage. So I don't think you're going to see any significant fluctuation just based on that.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, excellent. And then just one last one. I know you mentioned a contract that you've won since the merger's been announced. And so just wanted to know of just additional successes in Real-World Evidence since announcing the merger. Thanks a lot.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you. We are continuing to see good success and traction with our combined Real-World Evidence offering. Bear in mind the collaboration between Quintiles and IMS Real-World teams are predated the merger by quite a while. And I think it's about a year old now or thereabouts.
And so we've had time to â but of course it's a different thing to collaborate when we're on an arm's-length basis. And it will â that degree of collaboration will, obviously, increase as the capabilities will be merged into new offerings, new intellectual property and new go-to-market approaches.
Now, so this thing is not due to the merger, the big deal that I announced. It's just the result of that collaboration, but I highlighted it because it's a very large win. It's a multi-year win. It's with a top 20 pharma; it validates the combination of our offering. And we've had other wins, obviously, I just didn't mention because they are not of the same size. We have also, I should say a very large pipeline. I think it's over 100 very significant opportunities with pharma in which the combined teams are working.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks a lot, guys.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you provide more detail on the gross margin trend? Why it's down? And is this primarily mix? And why is tech services margin going down as well? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Ron?
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, yeah. I can provide you with detail on that. The first thing I would say is if you look at it adjusted for a normal adjusted EBITDA metric, what you see is gross margin in info is about flat and where the decline is is in tech services. And that's really driven principally by two things. First, the role and impact of acquisitions, which are coming in at lower margin. And secondly, as we do new tech solutions, technology and application software implementations, those are coming in with somewhat lower margins, in part because you have the implementation revenues which are inherently lower margin than that. So you have some mix shift within the technology services business towards technology application, which has some lower margin start-up project work in there. And that's the principal driver right there.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then when will levered free cash flow â not the unlevered free cash â start to improve? Free cash flow has been lighter than we expected in five of the last six quarters and at times materially lighter. Just curious -
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Everyone's speaking of the five of the last six quarters but there's been some unusual items in the first half of this year. For one, we've had this big outflow related to the loyalty card programs in the first half. And that should reverse as we go forward. As I say, that tends to balance out over time.
Secondly, we've had substantial restructuring payments and you're talking about your levered free cash flow. And we've also had some -- we told you in the first quarter about a big prepayment we had on a special acquisition of specialty data.
And those have been the big drivers. And there was also in the second quarter some timing related to accounts receivable. I think those things will improve in the second half.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Got it. And lastly...
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There's a two question limit. Shlomo, if we can get to the next question.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. That's fine.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We try to limit to one question but I know that you have 10 questions. Our IR team will be happy to talk to you after the call.
Adam Parrington - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Sounds good. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Thanks. So Ari, can you give us your preliminary thoughts on the impact of Brexit on the business? Are you seeing anything currently in terms of sales cycles or anything that would perhaps make you more cautious?
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Well, it's still very early day. We expect frankly minimal disruption to our business in both the UK and the remaining EU markets. It's worth noting that the UK represents approximately about 5% of total IMS revenue. It is a small portion of the overall business.
From a currency perspective, of course, the pound is 3% of our total revenue because again, remember we conduct business in over 70 currency. Look, the pound was a slight drag to revenue. You know, we are still analyzing. Let's say its early timing. We're having a lot of conversation with our clients.
Initially many of our clients, especially those that are headquartered in the UK or have European regional headquarters in the UK that was a little bit of a shock for everyone else and we saw a little bit of I would say a temporary halt. It coincided with the end of the second quarter and a little bit of an ad hoc slip off I would say in the UK, mostly due to â this is â sort of when something like this happens a little bit of a paralysis.
But we've been engaged in dialogues with our clients and I think as time goes by and people realize this is going to take time. No major impact. We don't expect â we have looked at all the potential implications and different scenarios. Under no circumstances do we envision a major impact or disruption to our business or business operations or our clients.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, Ron, you highlighted workflow analytics, tech apps as drivers in the tech services segment. Can you give us any more granularity or color in terms of the puts and takes, what's driving the revenue growth in terms of geographies or specific product offerings?
Ronald E. Bruehlman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Well, for the workflow analytics, these tend to be a bunch of smaller projects all over the world. So there really isn't any one geography I would point to. You saw that our emerging markets tend to be stronger than our developed markets, in general. That's true in info and also to an extent in workflow analytics, but it was really a strength across the board.
And on the technology services what you're seeing is as we integrate and we rollout our suite of Nexxus offerings we're getting good traction in the marketplace and a lot of that tends to happen in the more mature markets, because the mature markets is where you get the bigger adoption rate on software solution. So that's where the strength is.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean if I can add some color, I think the traditional buckets of offerings that we talk about in technology services I think we saw good revenue growth in taken (38:11) applications of the Nexxus suite offerings. Again, all the various wins that I highlighted in prior calls, really over the course of the year, are now beginning to translate into revenue and that's what you're seeing there, so strong growth. Second half was particularly strong this quarter.
Again, workflow analytics, we saw very good growth, getting more outsourcing, more projects, broad based. It was weaker in â Real-World Evidence was okay, was good. Consulting was weaker. I think it was even slightly declining. This quarter, as you know, consulting tends to be more lumpy and you will recall was very, very strong last year in the second quarter.
So there's a bit of a compare issue there. So that gives you really a little bit more color on the four sets of offerings in our tech services business. Overall, again, adding up to similar growth and as expected. Again, particularly strong on second half, weaker on consulting?
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Great. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
