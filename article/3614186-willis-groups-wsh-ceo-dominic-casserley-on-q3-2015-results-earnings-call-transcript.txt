Dominic Casserley
Thanks Matt and welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today to talk about our performance in the third quarter. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Nicolas Aubert, CEO of Willis GB; Todd Jones, CEO of Willis North America; and Tim Wright, CEO of Willis International.
Let's turn to our results. In short we executed well and delivered strong performance in a challenging economic and insurance environment. I will start by looking at some of our key financial metrics. Earnings per share increased 56% on an underlying basis driven by strong revenue growth of over 10% from our organic business and our acquisitions combined with strict cost management. 
If we look at the business just on an organic basis, then commission and fee growth was 3.3% in line with our expectations of mid single-digit organic growth for the year. We were able to increase the spread between organic commissions and fees growth and organic operating expense growth to 230 basis points above our 200 basis point target. This drove expansion of our operating margins on both an underlying and organic basis. I am particularly pleased with our consistency on this front as this month is the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. 
These strong results are attributable to the continued execution of our three pillared strategy to create value which I will review briefly now. The first pillar is driving organic growth while our diversified portfolio or risk advisory, brokerage, and human capital and benefits businesses. We delivered on that as demonstrated by the solid organic revenue growth from our portfolio that I mentioned previously. John and I will provide more detail on the drivers of the business lines and of our overall financial results later in the call. 
The second pillar of our growth strategy is execution of our strategic M&A program. We target firms that are complementary to our existing businesses and then work with our new partners to drive enhanced performance. Our underlying commissions and fees grew 10.5% in the quarter. I noted the 3.3% organic C&F growth earlier and the additional 7 percentage points attributable to M&A is evidence of good progress in this area. 
Now the quarter marked our first full period with Miller Insurance Services as part of Willis and the relationship is going very well. We solidified Miller's partnership with one of its largest clients earlier in the quarter by agreeing to sell 16.9% stake to BB&T to align our interest. This is a strategic transaction that was part of the anticipated plan since discussions with Miller first started, even though negotiation and executions were delayed due to some additional regulatory requirements.
We also announced the acquisitions of several targeted purchases to enhance our current product and service offerings; PMI Health Group in the UK, Elite Risk Services in Taiwan, and CKA in Australia. Looking ahead we had two of our most important, most transformative deals ahead of us. Our acquisition of Gras Savoye remains on track. In parallel we continue to work towards our proposed merger with Towers Watson, a transaction that we strongly believe will accelerate growth for both businesses and generate substantial value for all shareholders. 
Our third pillar is the transformation of our service delivery and our financial performance through our operational improvement program. As with the past three quarters, the impact of the operational improvement program is evident in our financial performance. The program continues to exceed our expectations generating $33 million in cost savings in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $63 million. These gains are a big driver of the increased spread between organic commission and fees and expenses. With another quarter of progress under our belts we have even greater comfort in our ability to meet the increased targets for overall cost savings and organic spread this year that we announced with second quarter earnings. 
So bottom line, we made significant progress across all three pillars of our strategy again in the third quarter resulting in mid single-digit organic revenue growth, over 10% underlined revenue growth, improved profitability, and positive operating cash flow, overall a strong performance. With that overview I'll now walk through the quarter in a bit more detail beginning with Willis International. 
International saw underlying revenue growth of 29.4%, another very strong performance that reflects the contributions of Max Matthiessen and the IFG pension and benefits business. Organically international grew 8.6% bringing its organic growth a solid 7% year-to-date. With the exception of CEEMEA where we saw declines in Russia, the segments generated growth in all regions in the quarter with double-digit growth in Latin America and mid single-digit growth in Western Europe. We also saw a modest growth in Asia as overall strength in the region was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in China. 
Now as you know we have been expecting to see some softening in Russia due to economic conditions there so that comes as no surprise. In China we saw some deferred projects due to economic uncertainty in the quarter offsetting strong growth in the first half of the year and we retain our optimism around the long-term growth prospects for this market. Overall it is a testament to the strength of our portfolio that we were able to produce 8.6% organic growth in the quarter despite softening in two of our largest economies and we expect international to finish the year on a strong note. 
Turning to Willis North America, we saw underlying revenue decline 3.8% as a result to steps weâve taken to exit several non-core businesses in our markets. On an organic basis, the business was flat. However, it should be pointed out that in this quarter always the smallest for North America we experienced timing differences versus the prior year in some business lines with certain sales shifting into the fourth quarter. This was most notable in the healthcare industry group. Adjusting for the timing of these sales, Willis North America would have reported modestly high quarterly organic C&F growth. 
Now let's turn to Willis Capital, Wholesale, and Reinsurance which includes Willis Re, Willis Capital Markets and Advisory, our wholesale business including Miller and Willis Portfolio and Underwriting Services which encompasses our programs business. DWNR achieved underlying growth of 32.6% driven by a full quarterâs contribution of Miller Insurance Services as well as SurePoint Re. As impressively, organic commission and fees increased 8.8%. We saw a revenue growth across most of the portfolio with solid growth in reinsurance and our capital markets and advisory and wholesale businesses. 
The Willis Re performance is notable given the continuing challenges of the reinsurance markets. Willis Capital Markets and Advisory had another strong quarter of performance driven by capital rising and advisory mandates completed during the quarter. 
Moving beyond the organic performance in CWNR let me make one comment about our largest acquisition in this segment Miller Insurance Services. Miller as expected is performing very well. While our overall expectations for contributions from Miller remain unchanged, the business generates most of its earnings in the first half of the year and this seasonality impacted profitability in the quarter. 
Let us now turn to Willis GB which is made up of our Great Britain based specialty and retail businesses. Organic commissions and fees declined 70 basis points as solid growth in P&C and strong growth in financial lines were more than offset by declines in transportation and retail. I mentioned last quarter, the segment is executing an operational turnaround. The team held expenses relatively flat in the quarter and has reduced expenses 3.4% year-to-date. Year-on-year Willis GB profits are up. We remain positive on the prospects for this business. So overall, a solid performance that again demonstrates the strength of our business and the effectiveness of our execution in a challenging global economic plan. 
Now let me turn the call over to John who will walk you through the numbers in more detail. John?
John Greene
Thank you, Dominic. Good morning to those on the call. I will be working off the third quarter slide deck, which is available on our website.
On slide three, you can see our EPS walk. As Dominic said, Willis grew underlying earnings by 56% over the same quarter last year. This was driven by underlying revenue growth of 10.7%, and continued successful execution of our cost management initiatives. On a reported basis our results reflect adjusting items that in total added $0.50 per share, the largest factor of this was the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $0.60 per share. 
As a result of the valuation allowance, we reported a tax credit of about $110 million. In all adjusting items in the quarter included two positive items, $0.60 from the deferred tax valuation allowance and $0.07 related to the gain on the disposal of a non-core business. And three negative items, $0.09 from restructuring charges associated with our operational improvement program, $0.07 from M&A transaction related cost, and $0.01 related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan Boulevard. 
I should also point out that as expected headwinds from foreign exchange began to ease in the second half of the year. When we spoke to you on our second quarter call, we said foreign exchange headwinds was to increase [ph] in the third quarter. As you know in the first half of the year, foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.13 per share to the bottom line. In the third quarter, the combination of translational and reval FX resulted in a benefit of about $0.04 per share. Based on current rates we now expect FX to negatively impact the full year by $0.11 to $0.15, so a little higher than our previous outlook. 
As we expected though, the bulk of this impact was felt in the first half of the year. In all I am pleased to report that the third quarter continued to salve trends we have seen throughout the year. Positive performance both organically and from our M&A strategy coupled with our cost management initiatives. Combined these factors drove margin gains and generated $0.05 improvement in underlying EPS. 
Let's turn to slide 4. As a reminder, as always the difference between reported and underlying revenues in each segment is the foreign currency movement. And the difference between underlying and organic is the net impact from acquisitions and disposals. But at Group level, underlying commissions and fees grew by 10.5% driven by Willis International and CWR. 
Dominic has described the drivers of performance in each segment so I will just add a little bit. Quarter-over-quarter foreign currency movements negatively impacted our revenues by about $47 million reducing the Group's underlying commission and fees by 640 basis points. Internationals results reflect the contribution of our acquisitions primarily Max Matthiessen and IFG together added approximately $30 million in revenue in the quarter. 
Within capital, wholesale, and reinsurance our underlying growth reflected the first full quarter of contribution from Miller Insurance Services. Miller added $33 million in revenue in the period. Organic growth in the quarter was driven by our M&A advisory business. In Willis North America, Dominic mentioned revenue turn we saw in third markets. Beyond this our construction book returned to more cyclical growth levels and was up 10% in the quarter. 
Let's turn to slide 5, the middle of the chart showed organic expense growth just a modest 1%. This was another quarter in which we were able to produce total organic expenses while generating --. Underlying operating expenses were 10.3% to $780 million driven by salary and other expenses related to our acquisitions. This increase once again is below our growth in underlying commission and fees, created 20 basis points of positive underlying strategy. We continue to be very pleased with our performance and cost management and a significant impact on profitability. 
Letâs walk through salary and benefit expense on slide 6. Here too we had again successfully controlled cost in the quarter. On the top part of this chart you can see we had another strong quarter of performance. Underlying salary and benefits increased 7% to $569 million with all of the increase resulting from the net impact of M&A activity. On an organic basis, salary and benefits were flat at $525 million driven by our FTE management initiatives. 
Letâs go a bit deeper into the FTE discussion on the bottom of the chart. As you can see organic headcount rose by 2.5% from the same period last year. All of this growth came from our expansion in lower cost, offshore or near shore locations. In fact onshore organic FTE declined by 500 year-over-year and we are down 200 from year end 2014. This is consistent with our strategy of relocating FTEs to lower cost regions. As I mentioned before the parallel running of growth associated with the operation improvement program will remain temporary FTA growth in some sources as we maintain -- this overlap will decline overtime and we will see a related reduction in cost. 
Turning to slide 7, which focuses on organic metrics by the way my favorite slide. As you can see from the chart, the combination of our solid organic revenue growth and our focus in cost savings are combining to drive strong organic performance. We are very pleased with the consistent improvement in the organic spread between revenue and expense growth. The graph on the left shows that the current spread between organic commissions and fee growth and expense growth has reached a new high of 230 basis points. The impact of this can be seen in the graph on the right. Organic fees have grown $20 million or more than 23% over the same period last year. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of expansion in organic spread, a fact we are very proud of. This is strong evidence that our revenue growth and cost savings initiatives are bearing fruit. 
Finally on slide 8, I just want to remind you of our commitment to the operational improvement program. You can see here that we continue to make progress against the program's key objectives. It is achieving everything we hoped it would. We are well on track to achieve or exceed our recently increased cost savings target of $80 million. Progress on the operational improvement program continued in this quarter, our efforts included the establishment of three low cost service centers in China, Bulgaria, and Central Florida. 
So let me finish by saying that with another quarter of delivery under our belts, we are in strong position to achieve our stated goals for the full year and deliver the growth and profitability we targeted. And now let me hand it back to Dominic.
Dominic Casserley
Thanks John. Before we open the call up to your questions let me leave you with a few thoughts. This was another strong quarter with results driven by execution on our three part value creation strategy. Our organic performance continues to be solid and we are confident of meeting our outlook for mid single-digit revenue growth and at least 200 basis points of positive spread for the 2015 full year period. 
Our carefully targeted acquisitions made a significant contribution to our underlying growth. We expect that the positive impact of our acquisitions on our growth will continue in the fourth quarter and into 2016. The impact of the operational improvement program continues to be very positive. We are making excellent progress towards our goals and have now seen four consecutive quarters of margin growth in the process. We also continue to expect that the program will turn cash positive with cost benefits exceeding restructuring charges in 2016. 
In short, our performance has been a result of the hard work and execution of our team and staff driving progress across all three pillars of our strategy. This has put us in a position to succeed and create a significant momentum that we will carry into our proposed merger with Towers Watson. 
Let me spend a moment on the transaction as our shareholders are asked to vote on it on November 18th. We are as convinced as ever that this proposed merger will bring together highly complementary businesses and efficiently connect each to new customers, geographies, and markets. The result is expected to be an acceleration in the ability of both companies to achieve their goals driving revenue, cash flow, and EBITDA growth superior to what either could achieve on its own. 
Both companies have the skills and experience to make this combination a success and generate significant value for shareholders. We are deep into integration planning and look forward to creating value for our shareholders, colleagues, and clients. With that I would turn it back to the operator and we can take your questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line Cliff Gallant of Nomura. You may ask your questions. 
Cliff Gallant
Hey, thank you. See I was hoping you would talk a little bit more about the North America revenue, organic numbers being flat. And I know you did address them and said that you see -- that on a normalized basis you would have seen a little bit of growth due to timing issues, but I was wondering in terms of the outlook particularly given the pricing cycle, what you think is a reasonable organic growth rate over the next say 18 months?
Dominic Casserley
So, good morning. I would say a rule that we remain very, very confident about our North American franchise overall and of course it is an important part of what the proposed merger with Towers Watson. But let me turn over to Todd to talk about the -- specifics about the situation. 
Todd Jones
Yes, thanks Cliff. I think as noted we tried to be pretty specific about some of the impacts in the quarter specific around the timing issue. We still remain, despite the fact as you noted that it is tough market and we have got some pricing headwinds that we see increasing during the course of the year but still remain really bullish in our ability to grow organically all the key drivers that we look at in terms of our production force, our pipeline, and what is going on in terms of new business conversion along with client retention, suggest the businesses operating well. We feel like we can always do better of course but we feel like we are set up to finish the year strongly and go into 2016 the same. 
Cliff Gallant
Okay, thank you. Actually I had one other question, it was unrelated but during the quarter you also announced a small transaction with BB&T regarding to selling part of the Miller and I was just little curious about that after you were just close on acquiring and can you tell us a little bit about what was happening there?
Dominic Casserley
Yes sure, it is Dominic again. As I hope to try to make clear, the negotiations with BB&T were running in parallel with our negotiations with Miller from day one. And so, it was always part of the plan from very early in these discussions that Miller would be -- BB&T would be part of this story. It just took longer to close that part of the transaction because of a more complicated regulatory issues that has gone through all the parties involved to make that. So, you shouldnât see this as a situation where we invested in Miller and then a few months later we sold part of the investment. In fact, we had always planned for the situation you now see, it just took longer to execute the BB&T part of that. 
Cliff Gallant
Okay, thank you. And great quarter. 
Dominic Casserley
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. 
Kai Pan
Thank you, good morning. So, first question is on your margin, it looks like the underlying operating margin expanded 30 basis points year-over-year while the organic actually margin expanded 240. So I think the delta probably is some drag from the acquisitions. I just want to see if you can specifically address three items there, one is what is the underlying margin of the acquired business and secondly, what is the impact of the amortization and how long it would last? And the third is any seasonality on the acquired business that is different from your core book, thanks?
Dominic Casserley
Kai I am going to hand it over to John in a second but you highlighted the key issues actually quite well. The underlying margin as we think is attractive. Obviously amortization increased and we actually laid out how much it went up. Of course in one of the slides earlier so that obviously had an impact. And definitely the seasonality of Miller has quite a big impact here. As we said, the vast majority of its profits are made in the first half of the year. So it does impact the numbers but John do you want to add anything on top of that. 
John Greene
Dominic, you summarized the key issue there, let me just add a couple of points here. So we previously gave some guidance that the acquisitions would deliver somewhere between $55 million to $65 million of EBITDA for the year. On an annualized basis we are on track to hit that. Now as folks on the call probably know, Miller timing was a bit delayed. We are waiting for approval from the FCA to commence the transaction. And as a result a certain amount of earnings actually that we anticipated when we gave that guidance actually ended up residing in Miller books pre-transaction. 
So again on an annualized basis we are on track to hit the guidance we provided for the year. Due to the timing we are going to be off of that somewhere between $5 million and $10 million. And the other question regarding amortization of the intangibles in the quarter it was $15 million increase from the M&A activity. Lion share of that was from Miller and a typical life on this stuff is seven years and each successive year it declines. Essentially it is a double declining balanced methodology. So hopefully that gives you the information you were looking for. 
Kai Pan
Thatâs great just follow up on the underlying margin are these acquired books similar to your core book or is there a room for improvement there as well?
John Greene
Yes, so whenever weâve done one of these deals we try to pay a reasonable price for the EBITDA that the business will generate. And then separately from the valuation we typically build in some anticipated cost synergies which would drive margin north. Honestly the deals we did excluding Miller slightly lower margin rates initially which we think will build overtime and by the way the price we pay reflected those lower margin rates. So again we are really comfortable with this pillar, this strategy and we are happy that each of the acquisitions we have done are performing to the performance that we modeled when we decided to commence the transaction. 
Kai Pan
Great, thanks for the detail. My last question is on the operational improvement program. It looks like the spending for the quarter is slightly less like the run rate and since like you have the big catch up to achieve, the $140 million spending for the full year, on the saving side are actually coming ahead of if you look at the run rate and only leave you about 70 million for the first quarter, is that -- can you talk about -- little bit about the timing of your spend and the savings? 
Dominic Casserley
So you did your homework. The spending is actually forecasted to be 140 million. We see that coming in perhaps lower in the total year outlook because the range of that is somewhere between $2 million and $8 million depending on timing of some exits. And the savings rate is actually -- it has been a positive story throughout the program. So, we are optimistic that we are going to deliver the 80 on the savings and perhaps a bit more. 
Kai Pan
Okay, great. Thank you so much and good luck.
Dominic Casserley
Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America. You may ask your question. 
Jay Cohen
I guess a really quick follow up on the last question, can you actually quantify the drag from Miller in the third quarter?
John Greene
Yes, its getting quite specific Jay but when I go back to the information that I provided on the last question so the total year guidance was 55 to 65. I think we are going to come a little bit short on that maybe 10 short in the calendar year. But on an annualized basis we will be at the numbers that we talked about. 
Jay Cohen
I was just thinking from APAS standpoint, what the drag from Miller was if you have that, and if you donât that is okay?
John Greene
You know, $0.01 is the ballpark. 
Jay Cohen
Okay, and I assume the fourth quarter will feel somewhat of a drag as well given that you have those expenses but the revenues tend to be first half weighted?
John Greene
Yes, that is a fair point. 
Jay Cohen
Okay, and I would say just in general when there is this kind of seasonality with an acquisition maybe you did talk about it and I missed it but that's really helpful, that kind of detail before you announce earnings is really helpful. And thanks for the details here, I appreciate it?
John Greene
And Jay, you know the driver that was actually the timing. It closed just over a month later than we thought it would. 
Jay Cohen
Got it, thanks John. 
John Greene
Yes. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. You may ask your question. 
Meyer Shields
Thanks good morning. So, one basic question to begin, there was $9 million of other income, is that the source of the $0.07 of excluded gains on disposals?
John Greene
Yes Meyer. There was $14 million of gains on disposals that we stripped out of organic and underlying. 
Meyer Shields
Okay, so the underlying -- let me say without that there wasnât a $5 million loss in other income?
John Greene
Yes, and that would have been primarily FX reval. Nothing else flows through there. 
Meyer Shields
Okay, that is helpful. Second, I guess the press release noted some timing issues both in North America and Great Britain and Dominic touched a little bit on the North American side, I was wondering whether there is any more detail or color we can get one maybe how much revenue was pushed to the fourth quarter in both these segments?
Dominic Casserley
So, there is a little bit of timing in GB and I am going to turn to Nicolas just to give a little detail on timing issues in GB. 
Nicolas Aubert
Yes, so thanks Dominic and good morning. Last year we had slightly more business in aerospace and energy [ph] space in fact in this quarter because being delayed in our planning for Q4 this year that is seasonal impact. Across the Board we have got good growth in P&C and in financial lines and slightly some shrinkage in marine, I believe and in the retail network business. So, that is the significant changes versus prior year in terms of top line. 
Meyer Shields
Okay was there any timing impact on the expenses in the segments?
Dominic Casserley
Timing on the expenses impact, not really, no. 
Meyer Shields
Okay, perfect. 
Nicolas Aubert
There was -- so just a minor comment maybe here that were some related to last year and of course we did nothing in fact this year. And we had also a slight difference in the acquiring of the AIP so it was a bonus last year versus this year. That is the only changes. 
Meyer Shields
Okay, that is very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. 
Ryan Tunis
Thanks, good morning. My question I guess is on some of the pension expenses here it has been tailwind and I think John called out in the last quarter but I think it is helping. It has been a tailwind for expenses by about 60 million this year. I just want to make sure I am thinking about that the right way that as we head into 2016 that will be in the base and I wanted to know if there is anything on top of the 60 million headed into next year that could impact the way we think about the expense comparison?
John Greene
Okay, so thanks for the question. So, I am just going to backtrack from the function around this call. So, there is two elements of the pension credit so one has to do with the asset performance of the business which typically is hard to predict. And we saw about $15 million to $20 million of benefit from that. And then the other aspect of the pension benefit related to the freezing of the pension that we did earlier in the year which drove the balance of the credit coming through the P&L. So both will be in the base year-over-year when we look forward to next year. The one point we are mindful of and you folks that are trying to build our projection should be mindful of is the underlying asset performance of the pension assets that could create some variability in the number. So it is certainly a nice benefit for this year but it was certainly a lot of hard work on the part of the management team to get us to the position where we were able to freeze it and execute a benefit not only to the P&L but on the overall pension deficit which came down substantially as a result of this. 
Ryan Tunis
Thatâs helpful, thanks. I think my follow up is probably for Dom and it is on just thinking about I guess natural expense growth without thinking about the cost saves, you talk about mid single-digit organic growth, we are looking at the 2016 I guess free cost saves, what type of expense growth do you think you probably have to obtain those type of organic revenue objectives?
Dominic Casserley
Okay I presume by Dom you meant Dominic it was somewhat bad on that one. So the way we think about this is the following, we see the operational improvement program as enabling us to continue to invest in the front office and in revenue generating activities. So yes it is obviously improving our economic performance. Youâve seen the results, you see the margin spread. We are getting year-on-year but it also is enabling us to invest in the business. And so the organic revenue growth we are getting today and the organic revenue growth we are getting going forward is enabled by the continued efficiencies we are generating. 
I mean for instance we donât generate over 8% organic revenue growth in international without obviously adding people. You would expect us to be doing that, it is a growth markets for us. On average we think that for the sort of organic growth we are looking at, we need sort of cost growth of about 3% across the portfolio and then obviously what we are seeing is the operational improvement program as it plays through. Meaning the net growth number is much below that. So thatâs broadly what we are looking at. 
Ryan Tunis
Thatâs helpful. Thank you Dominic, I appreciate that. 
Dominic Casserley
Itâs alright. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. 
Josh Shanker
Thank you. Yes, I want to follow up on Cliffâs question a little bit, I am assuming the secondary part of the Miller transaction, when you bought Miller you moved certain assets of Willis Wholesale into Miller in the business that was transferred or the share of the business that was transferred to BB&T did they acquire that Willis business as well?
Dominic Casserley
So we actually transferred some activities from Willis to Miller and some activities from Miller to Willis. BB&T is a pari-passu investor in the net Miller business alongside Willis on the same terms and conditions. 
Josh Shanker
So will they benefit from business that was formerly Willis business being written under the Miller name today?
Dominic Casserley
Sure, just like they are not benefitting from bits of the Miller business which have been moved into Willis, right. They are pari-passu investors in Miller alongside us. Yes. 
Josh Shanker
And why did it make sense, I know you left 10% or so with the original Miller personnel as incentive comp, why did it make sense to share the Miller pie with minority investors?
Dominic Casserley
Well, they are not just minority investors. BB&T as you know is one of the top six insurance brokers in the world, they have major flows into London, and so that is an attractive part of the arrangement. Obviously if you think thatâs through going forward as well as of course being an interesting player in the North American market. So all in all we are very, very excited about the net economic impact for Willis of BB&T coming into the Miller arrangement. 
Josh Shanker
Okay, I appreciate the call, thank you. 
Dominic Casserley
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neil. You may ask your question.
Paul Newsome
Good morning and thanks for the call. One housekeeping thing, just curious, when Willis decides to exit the business but it is not selling that business, just shutting it down, does that get included in your definition of organic growth?
Dominic Casserley
Well I donât think there any examples of that.
John Greene
So, let me go back, so if business decides, if Willis decides to shutdown the business rather than sell it, is that inorganic, is that the question?
Paul Newsome
Yes
John Greene
And the answer is absolutely yes.

Okay, and then I just want to sort of broader question, outside of the obviously Towers deal, you are still buying some and presumably looking to buy businesses. I would love your take on just kind of what is happening from an M&A perspective and insurance brokerage business, and my sense is things are getting more expensive and wanted to know if that was true?
Dominic Casserley
Yeah so, we obviously and I think because of our emerging track record in the acquisition space and the things we have done and the happiness I think of the new teams who have joined us, we get to see lots of opportunities these days. And we are -- all I can tell you is we are extremely disciplined in thinking through the net present value of any move we might take. It is true that certain assets are being priced up particularly those where the private equity industry is also a potential buyer. So, you have obviously seen some of the things going on and going around the North American regional brokerage market where you often do see very, very high prices being paid. 
We look at those somewhat askance frankly sometimes with the prices we can't make the economics work. So, what we have been doing as we said many times is looking at complimentary businesses, critically businesses where the people involved want to be part of the Willis family. They are making a positive choice for Willis, not a positive choice to sell but a positive choice to Willis and by the way now some of them are starting to say we are making a positive choice for Willis Towers Watson even though that is not complete yet. And then we looked very, very hard at the economics. And then we got to pass all those tests and all the integration and implementation charges before we will get close to that moving forward.
Paul Newsome
Great, thank you very much. 
Dominic Casserley
Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. You may ask your question. 
Brian Meredith
Hey, good morning. A couple of quick questions for you here. The first one, following on Ryan's question on underlying expense growth, John I just noticed in the quarter if you adjust for the savings in the quarter for operational improvement, looks like organic expenses, G&A expenses are up north of 5%. Was there anything unusual in the quarter that had anything to do with the pension?
John Greene
Brian, no there actually wasnât anything unusual. So, I will say it is a good challenge just to take the operational improvement program numbers right off the expense base and then calculate a growth rate. Now as Dominic mentioned about we will say the investments we are making in international in those high growth markets there is a certain level of reinvestment related to any of those markets where we see opportunity to grow. So, the operational improvement program as we said initially, the majority of those savings will fall to the bottom of the line -- bottom line. And we are continuing to monitoring that and we are actually well within that in terms of what is dropping. So, there wasnât anything unusual whatsoever other than a certain level of inflation and some reinvestments, selective reinvestment in the business.
Brian Meredith
Thanks, great. And then second question just a quick numbers question, any way we can get what the revenues were from Willis Capital Markets and Advisory in the quarter just for modeling purpose, I know that is kind of lumpy?
John Greene
We donât break that out separately. So, I am not going to comment on that on the call but I will say that it was up over a 100% versus the prior year. 
Brian Meredith
Great and then the last question was, I noticed an 8-K that came out I guess a day ago, it talked about amendments to the long-term incentive program, if the Towers Watson deals closed I guess maybe can you talk a little bit about why the change is there?
Dominic Casserley
Yes, its really around the metrics that we are able to use on that program. Obviously it is very simple basically, our compensation committee looked at the challenge of our LTIP in the first tranche under the merged company where it is not possible really to use the metrics we have before revenue and profit growth because the businesses aren't combined yet. So the compensation committee had to look at that with a lot of outside advice what was the right thing to do. And so just for this tranche, if we adjust this tranche we are changing them to performance relative to the S&P 500 with triggers relative performance to the S&P 500 because that would succeed to be the best measure we could use for this one tranche of LTIP. It's not proposal but that should be the long-term approach just to be specific tranche this time. 
Brian Meredith
Got you and that was the tranche that would end couple of years from now, itâs not the one that would necessarily end by this year? 
Dominic Casserley
Itâs looking at the performance of the business 2015, 2016, and 2017. 
Brian Meredith
Got you, makes sense. Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Denise Wilson [ph] of Wells Fargo. You may ask your question. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Hi, good morning. I just had a few questions, the first one in terms of the EBITDA that you guys mentioned from acquisitions for the year coming in a bit late the 55 million to 65 million, just so we can accurately compare when we get to the end of the year where we are sitting on a year-to-date basis relative to that metrics?
John Greene
On a year-to-date basis we are 60%. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Alright, so 60% of the 55 million to 65 million?
John Greene
Yes, with 5 million of timing that pushed into the following year. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay, great. And then in terms of the Towers Watson merger a few questions, first off what regulatory approvals are you guys still waiting on, waiting on for that transaction?
Dominic Casserley
We are waiting -- we are going through as you can imagine the big markets in which we operate we need to get regulatory approval from. We are going through that process. We are just waiting for a few of them to come through. I mean we are never quite sure of the timing and we are obviously very, very cognizant of the needs of our regulators buts it the usual big markets youâd expect us to be looking at. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay and then also in terms of that merger, I know that the combined company had laid out a bunch of revenue synergies that you pointed to, I am just curious as conversation a big piece of that was upside that you guys pointed to on the private healthcare exchange by bringing Willis clients over to lease on platform, have conversations begun with your clients in advance of this merger or is this something that you expect conversations to begin post close at the start of next year?
Dominic Casserley
So as you probably know Willis has the Willis Advantage healthcare exchange offering and it is the liaison product. Just white labeled as the Willis Advantage and so we have been had that as part of our set of offerings we provide to clients but it has been very much Willis providing a third party product. The big change weâre obviously going to have once the proposed merger is approved and closed is that we will now be operating with an in house product. We will be obviously much closer to the product development teams where we have to think through some of the incentive issues to really make this product hum through our distribution force. But we already know the liaison product, thatâs the point. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay, and how many at the end of this year, how many of your clients do you expect beyond the liaison product?
Dominic Casserley
We have given on and off updates on that thing, on that process. It is a very long pipeline of discussions taking place. As I have described I think on previous calls, actually for a company to move onto a platform like this is a big decision. We did it ourselves. Willis is on the Willis Advantage and it was a major, major decision. We have a very long platform. The numbers we will have by the year end will be in the teens or low 20s. Maybe in the 20s, Todd I am looking at you and you are nodding enthusiastically. Those sorts of numbers but the pipeline is long. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay and then one last question in terms of the o1rganic revenue growth, was there anything that impacted -- seasonally impacted the reinsurance growth, any one timers in there that might have positively impacted that number in the quarter? 
Dominic Casserley
Overall I am going to hand it to John for a second but overall the reinsurance -- remember the reinsurance business is a business which is much more concentrated by client, by number of clients than any of our other businesses. The top 50 or 70 clients dominate the revenues of that business as you would expect. So the timing of one or two clients can obviously affect the numbers in any particular quarter. John, do you want to highlight. 
John Greene
I was just going to add that on the second quarter call we did point out that we had some headwinds in reinsurance from timing and there was one customer, significant customer that pushed from second quarter into the third quarter which did help the organic results but nonetheless a positive performance from the reinsurance team with and without that particular timing issue. 
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay, thank you very much. 
Dominic Casserley
Thank you. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. You may ask your question.
Dan Farrell
Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could give us any color on the current trends of results across the lot?
Dominic Casserley
So I am going to turn to Tim right in a second. Overall we remain very excited about the growth of Willis situation. We are expecting to close that transaction in or around the year end. And of course it will materially impact the company, the client base and the spread of our geographic reach. We also are happy with the way the business is performing and let me hand over to Tim to give a bit more color on that. 
Tim Wright
Thanks for the question Dan. As Dominic said, Gras Savoye is doing very well but we describe that in two parts. First of all their business on a standalone basis. As you know they went through a turnaround in operation improvement program a number of years ago, and that helped with their cost base and they have been focused very much on growing on that solid foundation ever since. We see continued strong organic growth in the business. Not dissimilar to the sorts of levels of growth that we are seeing in the comfortable businesses at Willis. So thatâs very promising for the future and indicates our decision to accelerate the acquisition. 
The second part is that we are obviously working with Gras Savoye on integration planning where thatâs possible at this stage to before closing and identifying areas where we can create incremental value over and above that from bringing capabilities and relationships from each organization. That is progressing very well also. So we are pleased with the progress on Gras Savoye on those two fronts. 
Dan Farrell
Thank you and then just a quick question on the UK business, how much of the challenge in organic growth do you think is related to pricing from your specialty lines there, they enable a lot of green in aviation and then how much is the efforts within your control. I know you have been putting through some strategic initiatives there as well trying to improve it, thanks?
Dominic Casserley
Yes, so obviously pricing in reinsurance and then spreading into specialty lines is a well publicized story. Let me hand over to Nicholas just to give a bit more color on that. 
Nicolas Aubert
Yes, thanks Dominic and thanks for the question. Pricing pressure continues but quite interesting and because you referred to aerospace and aviation, despite the continuous pressure on aviation our teams are quite successful. In fact we are seeing some -- growth in addition when we talk about the reduction in consultation. In fact thatâs essentially coming from marine. So despite the reduction of the pricing we see some interesting prospects in terms of growth. Actually we are seeing an acceleration of new business growths. If you look at our new business in 2015 it has been increasing by 8% versus 4% in prior. So, interesting to see that of course that rate prediction continues but for us the growth is going to be coming from new business generation. 
Dan Farrell
Yes, thank you very much. 
Dominic Casserley
Thanks. 
Operator
Thank you. At this point there are no questions in queue. 
Dominic Casserley
Well, great. Let me thank you everybody for your questions. In closing let me just reiterate the following. We are proud of the solid progress we made again this quarter. Despite a challenging environment, we delivered on full parts of our strategy. We are on track to meet the expectations we set for the year. When we talk next, we expect it to be as Willis Towers Watson as we begin the next part of the journey to creating substantial shareholder value. Thanks again for joining us today. 
Operator
Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
