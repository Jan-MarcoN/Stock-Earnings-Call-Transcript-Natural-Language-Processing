Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fortinet First Quarter 2013 Earnings Financial Analyst Q&A. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Michelle Spolver.
Michelle Spolver
Hi, everybody. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us again for those who are on our first call for the earnings announcement earlier today. Joining me are -- is Ken Xie, our Fortinet Founder and CEO; and Ahmed Rubaie, who is our new CFO and COO.
So I think if you guys know, the purpose of this call is really to do follow-up questions now that you've had a chance to dig in deeper a little bit in our numbers. We'll try and keep the call to an hour, and it is all Q&A session.
Before we start, let me just remind you that the forward-looking statements that I read at the start of our earlier call apply to all forward-looking statements that we make during this call.
So let's see. With that, operator, you can take the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
The first question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Ahmed, just a couple clarifying questions. You were talking about your responsibility as COO. Is it purely operational to start? Or do you have a dotted line to sales and marketing?
Ahmed Rubaie
It's actually across the board. There are no lines defined yet. I think the best way to look at it is, I will come in as the steward of the business as CFO, and we'll work towards helping scale the business on both the sales end, as well as the operating end. And then that's probably the best way to answer it.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And a second clarifying question on the guidance. Are you factoring the pipeline any differently than your predecessor that you're aware of?
Ahmed Rubaie
I'm not aware of what my predecessor has done so I apologize. I don't know the comparison. All I can tell you is, from my perspective, I've studied bottoms up, tops down and formulated guidance with the team based on what we know today.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. A couple higher-level questions and maybe these are for Ken. But there was the Secure Wireless LAN solution, Ken, and then Coyote Point on the ADC side. And I guess just more broadly, what's the -- where are we headed with these other categories? Then there's companies out there that just do these, obviously. So I understand how these may be confusing to sales within Fortinet, possibly. They're small still, but they are different markets. So maybe if you could talk about the strategy behind the TAM expansion.
Ken Xie
Yes. The Wireless Wi-Fi solution, the request come from our customer base, especially [indiscernible]. Sometime, they do need secure both the wire and the Wi-Fi together. So we'll be helping to manage them more easily, unify all this together. So that's where the request come from, the customer base. And we see market demand in this combined solution. The ADC is also similar because we have some kind of ADC product before. From time to time, some customer using ADC [indiscernible] a few firewall, a few UTM product. And we see -- we were not trying to target the traditional ADC market more in the data center but really among some of our customer base, which they're using to balance among the solutions. So that's where the tool solution keeping come up. And we also feel some technology long-term-wise can be combined into UTM solution. So that's where short term, we try to offer the product, and long-term, also some of that may be also starting integrating to the whole UTM.
Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And last question for me on the MT6. Do you expect to see any changes to typical seasonality in the second half as MT6 product comes out the door?
Ken Xie
Like I mentioned, both the MT and also the FortiOS -- I mean, the FortiASIC, the FortiOS, we're not selling directly, will be gradually built into the FortiGate product. And the MT6 will be -- improve the performance a lot, but it also will take some time gradually built into the product because the silicon is 3x to 4x larger than the previous version. So that's where we'll be towards the second half of this year. We're starting to see -- if I was in a long schedule will be towards the second half of this year we're starting build into the product.
Operator
The next question comes from Michael Turits from Raymond James.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
A couple of questions. First, I asked a question on the call, but can we go back into the services down 1% this quarter, which again you haven't seen a decline in services before the sequential decline?
Ken Xie
We believe we have a tool last building date.
Ahmed Rubaie
So Michael, there were 2 less active business days to build.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. But is that normal accounting function? I mean, this 2% up last year in this quarter, so -- again, I haven't done the math on it, but typically, you don't come anywhere near those?
Michelle Spolver
Yes, Michael. So one, it is hardly -- there's 2 things. One, 2 less days, that is true. The other one is that less revenue for professional services. Just know that professional services as an overall component of our services line item is still small, but we did see less professional services revenue come in during the quarter. And that was sort of -- that would equate with the fact that we had less larger deals. So the professional services usually get attached to the large deals.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then obviously, you've brought down the numbers for the year, but it's still a pretty healthy ramp and back half seasonality on the license or product side if I -- have you grown services a couple of percent next quarter sequentially and then mid single digits in the back half, what seems right given the slower pace. Can you still ramp from -- you still have, again, pretty healthy growth in the third quarter, almost 10%-ish in product that you're modeling out and mid-teens sequentially in product in the fourth. So what gives you guys the confidence at this point that you can come back to that kind of sequential growth?
Ahmed Rubaie
Well, I think in terms of -- let's back the train to Q1 and go forward from there. In terms of Q2, we are really -- it's business as usual. We see a softening in the macro that's going to continue to impact our business. The reason you're seeing the acceleration in the second half of the year -- first of all, one quarter doesn't make a trend; second of all, our fourth quarter is seasonally our largest quarter; and thirdly, we have been investing in the sales and marketing apparatus for a number of quarters. So we're hoping the combination of all those things will, in fact, help the ramp-up later in the year. From my own perspective, Michael, I'm zeroed in and focused on Q2. And I'll give you more color. Obviously, with 1 week, I don't know enough to tell you what's going to happen later in the year but enough to say it's going to be down relative to the July guidance and enough to know that there are certain things in the works that should help us make those numbers later in the year.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then one of the things that you guys mentioned is -- I can't remember which deal is on, but moving on to competitive issues, you did say that you saw F5 in 1 deal. Can you just remind me where that is? And have you seen them before? And obviously, they've made a big deal about trying to get into security. So what are you seeing with those guys?
Michelle Spolver
Yes, let me just clear up. We don't see them on an everyday basis, so we don't look at them as a primary competitor. When we do see them, it's usually the data center or high-end deals.
Ahmed Rubaie
The transaction was in APAC.
Michelle Spolver
Yes. And this was in APAC. So this one was a telco provider, and they were looking for data center firewall. And that would be the only case that we see F5, and we still don't see them all that often.
Michael Turits - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
If this was in APAC, it was a service provider looking for data center firewall?
Michelle Spolver
Yes. Yes.
Ahmed Rubaie
Exactly. Yes, it was our FortiGate-5000 series that we sold.
Operator
The next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Just you have refreshed your operating system and your ASICs, and I know that it did cost somewhat of an inventory issue in the quarter that you addressed. I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you expect customers to uptake those products, how you expect that to roll out through that architecture through the product line? And how should we expect that to have an impact on how you think the year will shape up in terms of product revenue with refresh activity?
Ken Xie
Okay. Yes, these are 2 parts. First is software FortiOS. I don't think we'll have a much direct impact because the FortiOS, all the current [indiscernible] service, which is about 80%, they all get a free upgrade. And also, we are not selling FortiOS separately, it's all kind of part of the whole system. And the FortiASIC will take some time to gradually build into the system. Actually, even through an issue, we see a little bit. I think probably also because Q4, we are very strong, but inventory will be relatively a bit low. Some of the component may take like a couple of months to kind of set a component. Some of them [indiscernible] component may even take like 16, 18 weeks from some other major network vendor there. So that's why from time to time, we probably try to keep improving and try to do better forecast on some of the inventory. But also, from time to time, certain deals, certain bigger deals, certain [indiscernible] may have kind of a twisted inventory level, which take a little bit of time to recover. So that's the whole scene. But it's -- I think the FortiOS and the -- we don't have much impact on the inventory and also the FortiASIC will be more long-term improvement of the platform performance.
Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
And just on, I guess, maybe to make it just a finer point. Do you expect -- I think we've seen some of your competitors or your peers refresh their product lines, and it had an uptick in growth rate, all Sourcefire we've seen others. But Check Point last year came out with new appliances and talked about seeing customers actually trade down because of the macro and getting sort of the same performance for a lower price. And I'm wondering, do you expect -- I guess, as a whole for fiscal '13, is the refresh a positive driver in your business, a negative driver in your business or is it sort of a nonevent?
Ken Xie
We don't feel [indiscernible]. I think our philosophy to operate a product, really, once the new generation come in, we pretty much keep it the same least price as the old generation, like whether the FortiGate 300C replaced the old 300B. So we would kind of keep the same price, but also, each new generation can have a better performance because the Moore's Law do apply every 18 to 24 months. You can see that speed double both on the semiconductor and the network side. So that's where our new generation tend to have a much better performance than the old one. So that's where -- but for us also, every quarter, we may refresh a couple of product. We have -- on the FortiGate platform, we have like 20 to 30 different models covered from SMB, then the price of a service provider. So that's where the -- the whole process we see. Basically, we try to replace new generation at the same price as the old generation, but it's better performance.
Michelle Spolver
Walter, we're not seeing -- we haven't seen the trend that Check Point has been talking about in terms of customers trading down. That's not something that we've been seeing.
Ken Xie
Yes. And also, like the current speed also starting to get faster and faster, I see this year customer starting to deploy the 40 gig, even the 100 gig. And then a few weeks ago, the new standard for the 400 gig also come out. So you can see the networks keeping go faster. And also, once the more functional also starting integrating into the secure gateway because inline device had to cover all the application, you also see the function requirement, also multi-function required also in the gateway. So that's where the platform performance starting getting more and more important, which we kind of reach in this a long time ago trying to build technology to address the issue way ahead of our other competitors.
Operator
The next question comes from Rick Sherlund from Nomura.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes. Can you tell me on the Coyote Point, when did that close?
Ken Xie
I think we closed the end of March.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Okay. So that was in the quarter. Was that -- what were the terms on that? Have you disclosed that?
Ken Xie
We'll not disclose the detail, but the number we gave is really an impact $0.02 for this year, and there will be more favored next year.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
But what are the revenues expected to be for this year?
Ken Xie
We only disclose the last 12 months is $5 million.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
All right. So there's no reason to believe the revenue is going to go down when you buy it, right?
Ken Xie
We hope not.
Michelle Spolver
We're not actually -- we're not guiding you to say that it's going to be $5 million this year. We just say what they did last year.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes, I understand. So if we -- and how much of that is product versus services for their business?
Ken Xie
Pretty much most is product. They are not like the 40 gig had the subscription part, they're more like -- just like traditional infrastructure is more product, plus some support.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
And was it cash or stock that you paid?
Ahmed Rubaie
We're not disclosing the terms. I think here's the way to summarize it. I think the way to think about it is, it's a technology enhancement tuck-in. And, in general, we're very cheap so we don't pay high multiples. And I say that with only 1 week on the job, but I learned that very quickly. And I subscribe to the same theory. And to the collective team's point, I think the only numbers we're comfortable discussing are the trailing 12-month revenue at approximately $5 million. It will be $0.02 dilutive in the current year, and it will be accretive next year. And we're working very hard on integrating it from a product perspective, with hopes of a release in the summertime and some impact going forward.
Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division
Yes. I'm just trying to model and without knowing whether I should bump the share count up or what. It's still little hard to do. But I did notice the expenses jumped up a lot. G&A was up a lot, for example, in Q1. Is that something that's going to be sustained? I'm not sure what's behind...
Ahmed Rubaie
Yes, I know. We had a couple of onetime impacts, but G&A should drop back down to 4% in the current quarter. So that's what we've modeled for Q2, Q3, Q4.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Erik Suppiger from Jolson Merchant Partners.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
I apologize if you already addressed this, but can you review again what you mean when you say you saw some of your carriers or service providers adopt more of an OpEx spend rather than a CapEx spend?
Ahmed Rubaie
Yes, I think -- let's speak financial guy to financial guy. I think what Ken was describing is a purchasing behavior. And it's not so much CapEx versus OpEx, it's more of guy sitting in my shoes controlling the checkbook and saying, "Instead of spending of $1,000, you're going to spend $200 or you're going to spend it over the next several quarters." That's really all he meant to tell you.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
So it's really a timing of payment rather than an allocation between OpEx, CapEx. Is that the right idea?
Ahmed Rubaie
No. So it's not CapEx, OpEx nor is it timing of payment, it's more the CFO of x Enterprise saying, "Let's not go spend $1,000 right now. You can cut your teeth in the $200 for now or start with $200, you can ramp up in the next quarter." So it's more about conservative buying behavior than it is about CapEx versus OpEx for payment terms.
Ken Xie
Maybe I'd say it's already break out one big a deal, few smaller deal.
Ahmed Rubaie
That's another way to put it, yes.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
Okay, that's very helpful. Second question, just on the software, the FortiOS, were there any stability issues or any issues from a technical perspective as you rolled out 5.0 that were contributing to your product shortages and issues?
Ken Xie
No, no. I think the FortiOS, we can load out all the previous version of the current FortiGate there. I don't think the product shortage relate to the FortiOS. The product shortage more relate to a certain model has sort of shortage because they ramped up quicker than we expected. And sometime, especially when we ship in some international order, the distributor, they tend to have all the model all come in altogether. So instead of sometime, we can separate the shipment because some international distributor they don't want to do like a multiple time import/export process. So that's the part sometime we need to have certain model shortage sometime may impact a little bit more shipment. So that's the -- like we mentioned, the FortiGate-100D, also the FortiGate-60D, that's the 2 model we have shortage.
Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division
Okay. In terms of the FortiOS, the 5.0 release, has that been -- have there been any stability issues with that?
Ken Xie
So far, the feedback is more of our positive because we see much more enhancement. And also the 3 things I mentioned really once addressed the mobile security, the BYOD issue, which enterprise is facing. And the second really addressed the APT, especially the cloud base and the sand boxing, the reputation. And also, the other part is really easy to manage when -- and as you can really -- automatic profile was normal traffic. Normal traffic don't have to depend on a fixed policy to do it. We have not seen that as much like an issue because remember, this is a product we have beta for more than a year. And so far, the feedback is very, very positive in the field.
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Two questions from me. One is kind of a longer-term vision question. In terms of buying Coyote and getting that technology on board, I was wondering if you could talk to us about sort of how you see sort of the ADC world and the network security world coming together. Why is that an important purchase for you guys to be making and sort of getting that technology in-house?
Ken Xie
I think we have shipped in the ADCs more kind of OEM version in the last couple of years. And from time to time, when customer deploy whether the FortiGate or some other system, they also try to use -- I think using the ADC to balance a little bit. On the technology side, the ADC [indiscernible] balance leverage the same layer technology as a firewall address translation. So basically, both on the session layer try to translate the address, firewall will translate outside the internal address. We're a little balanced trying to translate address to certain server. So technology, there are some similarity, but it's more on the firewall level. But for us, since we started the company as compared to my previous company, so we tried to more address the content application security, which is in the higher layer. So sometime, you may use a lower layer, try to balance or forward some traffic to the higher layer processing gateway there. So that's kind of -- it's the whole solution deployment, which is ADC is a part of some total network security solution. So that's where we see certain feed into the whole structure there.
Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, two, more tactically, when you guys are talking about the changing purchasing behaviors with service providers, any kind of indication you could give us to kind of what percentage of your service provider base does this actually impact? Or what percentage do you guys think this is going to be seen across or is it just a couple of isolated incidents here and there?
Ken Xie
I think like we said in the number from 1 year ago, the service provider is about 30%, Q1 is about 25%. And also, I see there's 2 kind of service provider model. One is really the bigger box, the other data center, this kind of a centralized solution. That's more leeway to 5000, the FortiGate-5000. The other one is more like the press release we made yesterday, the huge network, they are modeled to the CPE deployment and then they can use a FortiManager to try to manage remotely of a lot of a smaller CP block on the customer side. So I think so far, we see the CP base feel worst or [indiscernible] strong and also the leverage and the new product, new chip we have. The kind of centralized, sometime they depend on how quickly the service provider build their own infrastructure to support a customer. So we see some kind of -- I mean, some kind of a -- we'll not see a slowdown but more cautious spend in patent in that area. So that's probably dependent on the whole service provider, the whole macro environment changes. They may change the pattern, but so far, we see a little bit cautious in the last quarter.
Michelle Spolver
Yes. Let me actually -- and then also, I think the cases that we talked about in Q1 that contribute to the mix was isolated with those cases. But as we've seen from other companies and we've kind of seen since then is that there is some softness we don't expect. We hope it turns around, but we're not building that into our guidance. Our guidance reflects everything sort of stays the same within the service provider space.
Ken Xie
Yes. Also, none of our competitors really pay much in that space. We have a huge advantage both on the high end and also on the CP device and plus the function past the virtualization. A lot of sense really make us -- we are ahead of other competitors.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Tom Ernst from Deutsche Bank.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
It's Todd on behalf of Tom. Just a clarification on the free cash flow. Your guidance is down from last year for free cash flow. And you said that you have CapEx going up because of investment in IT and investment on a new office building. How much is CapEx going up from '12?
Ahmed Rubaie
Yes. So just to be clear, I'm glad you asked the question. In the prior guidance, prior to my arrival, meaning back in January, we had already thought through the potential technology upgrade and also anticipating the potential move next year. So the guidance down is not related to incremental CapEx, it is strictly because billings are down, therefore, free cash flow is down. There's no change in our assumptions. And it's too early for me after 1 week. I need to gut those numbers out and get comfortable that, in fact, these are the right numbers for the technology upgrade. And as we start, we know we have to move, so we've allocated money for that. But we're not moving in until next year either. So in short, the guidance being lowered is strictly related to billings coming in lower for the year.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
But slower compared to 2012 also. If you look at the midpoint of the guidance, we're not even midpoint if you look at the top end of the guidance. $150 million is lower than what you guys reported in 2012. So it's actually going down on an absolute dollar basis from last year. And I'm assuming the operating cash flow would grow at least in line with the billings, which kind of if I do a rough math that kind of implies that CapEx is doubling '13 over '12.
Ken Xie
We're also wondering why we've seen a growth. I think that's where -- like I said, we have almost $800 million cash. We want to make sure we're keeping amassing the growth going forward. That, we feel, is the best use of the cash and also improve company value in the long-term position.
Ahmed Rubaie
In terms of ongoing company CapEx, there are no changes from the past.
Michelle Spolver
No, no. Sorry. Just a slight correction. So in 2012, we did not have any CapEx dollars allocated for technology upgrade or for moving for the building. So Tom, that would be in the range of, I think, about $10 million, but otherwise, it's the same year-over-year.
Ahmed Rubaie
Yes. Sorry. The point I was making is that ongoing business CapEx, it's business as usual, there's nothing going on from a CapEx perspective.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Anything incremental in 2013 would be because of the IT investment and the move to the new office. Is that -- anything incremental on top of regular CapEx would be just because of those...
Ahmed Rubaie
Those are the only 2 items. And the point I was trying to clarify for you is that was thought through back in January. The difference between January and April is strictly billings. And certainly, your underlying question, there is no changing CapEx behavior at the operating company level.
Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Got it. No, but if I just do a rough math, it seems like CapEx would double on a dollar basis from '12 to '13.
Ahmed Rubaie
Well, as Ken pointed out to you, and you can see it also in the heart of the P&L, because the investments have been ramping up so I don't have the number right in front of me, but we finished the 2,077 headcount. We were at roughly 1,500-something last year at this time. So that's one point of reference. Another point is, obviously, we've done an acquisition as well. So it isn't anything, again, just to repeat, anything at the operating CapEx level.
Ken Xie
I think like I mentioned [indiscernible] we see in end of 2008, early 2009 is the best time to hiring and also do some acquisition because it's more easy to get good people on board. And also the valuation when acquiring some company or technology is much cheaper, and that's kind of better valuation compared to the other time.
Operator
At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ahmed for closing remarks.
Ahmed Rubaie
Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We'll hopefully see you on the road in this coming quarter. There are a couple of several events actually scheduled. And to the extent you have follow-on questions or clarification questions, please reach out to Michelle and she'll coordinate accordingly.
Ken Xie
Thank you.
Michelle Spolver
Great. Thanks a lot, everybody.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.
