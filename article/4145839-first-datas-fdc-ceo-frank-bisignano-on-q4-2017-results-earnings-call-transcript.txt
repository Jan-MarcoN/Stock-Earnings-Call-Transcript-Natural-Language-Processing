Good morning, and welcome to First Data Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Poillon. Please go ahead.
Peter Poillon
Thank you. Welcome everyone to First Data's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our call today is being hosted by Frank Bisignano, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of First Data. Joining Frank on the call is Himanshu Patel, Chief Financial Officer. Frank and Himanshu will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings press release and supplemental schedules are available on our website at investor.firstdata.com.
Throughout this call, segment revenue, expense and EBITDA growth rates referenced by Frank and Himanshu will be on an organic constant currency basis and exclude the impacts from currency, and acquisitions and divestitures. After Frank's and Himanshu's prepared remarks, we'll open the call up to Q&A, and our standard ground rules will apply. We request that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up in order to be fair to as many participants as possible. 
Now, I'd like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risks and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions or actual results are described in today's presentation, and in our SEC filings. We'll also discuss items that do not conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We've reconciled those measures to GAAP measures in the appendix of the slide presentation and in the supplemental schedules to the earnings release.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Frank.
Frank Bisignano
Thank you Peter. Good morning everyone. Itâs a pleasure to be on the call today. The fourth quarter completed a year of solid performance for First Data. In the quarter, our adjusted EPS improved by 13% to $0.44 per diluted share. On an organic constant currency basis, segment revenue grew 4% and segment EBITDA grew 8%. Our EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points. Free cash flow in the quarter was once again healthy at 280 million. 
For the full year, we generated over $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Our average ratios declined modestly during the year, despite spending 1.6 billion to acquire CardConnect, BluePay and Acculynk. In short this was a solid quarter of overall performance, completing a good year that was in line with our guidance. 
Himanshu will provide the deep dive into our financials, so Iâd like to update you on the progress weâre making on some of our important initiatives. As Iâve discussed in the past, one of First Dataâs key differentiators is the breadth and depth of our product and services, and the fact that we can provide these to our customers on a global basis through an enterprise based approach. 
In the fourth quarter, we had a solid quarter in terms of closing new deals. Hereâs a list of some of the interesting enterprise deals that closed recently. In GFS, we continue to expand our global presence as mentioned in our joint press release on January 25, we entered into a significant new processing agreement with SBI cards, a subsidiary of the State Bank of India, the largest bank in India. We also signed a processing agreement with RBL Bank, one of Indiaâs oldest private sector banks. These deals represent a meaningful expansion of our GFS business in India, where card usage is expanding rapidly. 
In the US, we are delighted that we have entered into a new retail private label processing relationship with the large issuers that will bring several million new accounts to our system when itâs on-boarded later this year, further cementing our leadership position in this space. We also signed two significant statement printing deals with PNC and Verizon. 
On the renewal side in GFS, we have renewed important relationships with several of our top financial institutional partners including Credit One and PSCU. In GBS, we signed a number of new clients including Innovative Control Systems, the leading provider of technology solutions for the car wash industry with equipment in over 12,000 sites in more than 30 countries around the world. Illinois Tollway with multiple products expanding from e-commerce to telecheck and security and Dell for global e-commerce solutions. The last two were competitive takeaways. 
Iâd also like to provide an update on our progress in the integrated space where as you know we made two strategic acquisitions during the year to accelerate our entrance into the high growth ISV market and establish ourselves as a vital player in the market. On the integration front, both CardConnect and BluePay are deep into the integration process and both are going well. 
On the revenue front, Iâm extremely pleased with the growth trajectory these businesses are displaying in the short time that weâve owned them. Let me provide some quantitative substance around why this happens in the ISV business since last time CardConnect reported as a standalone public company after Q1 â17. 
Our pipeline of ISV opportunities has tripled, and our total number of live integrations is up over 70%. During the fourth quarter, we had 24 new ISVs go live. And finally, merchant production across the ISV channel has more than doubled. Granted we are starting from a small base relative to the size of First Data, but weâre confident that weâre taking market share in the integrated space. 
As we continue to integrate the product offering and bring our Clover platform as a component of the fully integrated offering to ISV clients, I believe it will simply add to our best-in-class offering in the integrated space. And while Iâm on this subject of Clover, Iâd like to provide a brief update on some Clover stats. 
We have over 400,000 Clover units shipped, excluding our Clover Go. Including Clover Go, over 750,000 units has shipped. We are now processing approximately $50 billion annualized on Clover and thatâs up over 50% year-over-year. 
Finally, Iâd like to discuss our GBS North America JV business. First, Iâm very pleased to announce that our PNC Merchant Services joint venture was recently renewed and extended to 2024. This is great news and I could tell you that we are fully committed to continually innovating to provide best-in-class solutions to the joint ventures clients and we look forward to continuing our work with a significant partner. And I think this earlier renewal and extension with PNC is indicative of the strong relationships that we have across all of our bank partners. 
Next Iâd like to discuss the important issues that weâre executed against to renovate this channel. We are working closely with our bank partners to accelerate and simplify digital lead acquisition and we are making progress. 
Let me explain what that means, the first thing that youâll see happen will be inside the bank branch, where our JV partners are moving to largely eliminate physical sign-up forms and converting to digital signup within the branch. And the credit decision process which for some customers can take a few days will be significantly accelerated in many cases shortened to just seconds. Thatâs part one of the digitization process. 
The next component, the ultimate self-service solution will be to allow merchants to log on to the banks website, apply for a merchant account online and receive a credit decision. Iâm happy to say that each of our partners has committed to these initiatives and that they are on various stages of implementation. We are immensely proud to have these fabulous franchises as merchant acquiring partners and look forward to years of continued collaboration and growth. 
In summary, Iâm pleased with the substantial progress weâve made across many key initiatives. Our 2017 growth metrics were in line with current year guidance despite a fairly significant headwind in the JV channel. Weâve announced a number of innovative solutions and acquisitions that further strengthen the portfolio of products and services we offer our clients, and we generated robust free cash flow. 
Iâm excited about the future of this company. We address what I consider the strategic gap in the ISV space with the acquisitions of CardConnect and BluePay, in our view, the two premiere standalone properties in the integrated space. Our Clover suite of products has great momentum with further growth ahead as we fully integrate in to our ISV offering. 
Our enterprise sales momentum is strong and deals across all three segments are ramping. Our international businesses are growing well above industry rates, and this is a business that will continue to generate significant free cash flow. Separately, Iâm pleased to announce that our next investor day which will be June 12 in New York City. Youâll get more information on that event in the near future. 
Let me turn it over to Himanshu for a deeper dive in to the quarterâs financial results, and our guidance for 2018 before we open it up for Q&A.
Himanshu Patel
Thank you Frank, good morning and good afternoon everyone. Iâm going to start on slide 4 the summary of our Q4 results. Iâll focus on the non-GAAP and segment financial metrics which more closely reflect how we manage our business. Segment revenue which modifies consolidated revenue primarily to exclude certain pass-through revenue and to proportionally consolidate the revenue of our major joint ventures was $1.95 billion in the quarter. That was up 7% on a reported basis or up 4% on an organic constant currency basis which adjust reported growth rates for the impacts of currency translations, acquisitions and divestitures. 
Q4 adjusted net income per diluted share came in at $0.44, up 13% versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by improved operating results and lower interest expense. Q4 total segment EBITDA of $848 million was up 10% on a reported basis or up 8% on an organic constant currency basis, and segment EBITDA margin improved by 140 basis points to 43.5%. 
As Frank mentioned, we had another strong cash flow quarter, generating $280 million of free cash flow. For the full year we generated $1.36 billion of free cash flow. Iâll discuss cash flow in greater detail on the later slide. 
Slides 5 and 6 and informational slides that summarize financial performance for Q4 and the full year respectively including a breakout of results by segment. Let me discuss the segment in more detail beginning with GBS on slide 7 and 8. GBS Q4 segment revenue of $1.13 billion was up 10% on a reported basis or up 4% on an organic constant currency basis. GBS segment EBITDA of $494 million grew 11% on a reported basis or 7% on an organic constant currency basis and its reported margin improved 20 basis points to 43.7%. 
Iâd like to discuss GBS revenue results by region, starting with North America. GBS North America saw 6% reported revenue growth in Q4. On an organic constant currency basis, GBS North America revenues were flat in the quarter. Normalizing this organic growth to exclude the impact of hardware revenue in both periods, GBS North America revenue was flat, a slight improvement from the third quarter growth rate of this business measured on a comparable basis. 
As a reminder, by removing hardware revenue from this growth metric by definition we are also eliminating the revenue benefit from the Clover accounting change in the currency period. 
Now Iâd also like to provide some color on GBS North American organic results by distribution channel. The JV channel saw a low single digit decline in its normalized revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter, representing an improvement from the mid-single digit decline we saw in this channel last quarter. 
We continue to expect this channel to gradually improve, although year-over-year growth rates may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We believe an important KBI in the JV channel is lead flow, and for the first time in several quarters, JV lead flow improved year-over-year up low-single digits in the quarter. We view this as a step towards stabilization in the channel. 
We are confident that GBS North America in total will continue to gradually improve over the coming quarters, supported by continued solid performance in the enterprise business, healthy organic growth within recently acquired businesses like CardConnect and BluePay and as I just mentioned the gradual recovery of our JV business.
Iâd like to provide a brief update on the CardConnect and BluePay acquisitions before moving to GBS results outside of North America. We closed on the BluePay acquisition in early December so we have one month of its financial results included in the fourth quarter. CardConnect and BluePay saw strong revenue growth in the quarter; we plan to continue to invest to build out the integrated solutions businesses of both companies. 
We firmly believe that our ISV offering which combines robust solutions for both card-present and card-not-present, simple integration and a state-of-the-art partner management tool for ISVs is second to none. And we believe we can build on this competitive advantage as we layer in the Clover platform in to our ISV offering further differentiating First Dataâs technology stack for our integrated partners and providing additional distribution opportunities for the Clover platform. 
Now letâs discuss our business outside of North America, where our results were once again fairly strong. GBS EMEA revenue grew 10% on an organic constant currency basis, driven by good growth in the UK and Germany and some lumpy revenue in the quarter. GBS Latin America maintained its strong growth rate up 52% on an organic constant currency basis. Latin American revenue grew 56% in full year 2017, let by Brazil and with solid growth in Argentina as well. 
In Brazil, which was a green field startup just four years ago, First Data now has a merchant acquiring business generating over $125 million of annualized revenue growing at a rapid clip. We remain bullish about the growth opportunities in Latin America for our GBS business medium term. GBS APAC grew 24% on an organic constant currency basis, driven primarily by strength in India. 
Letâs turn to GFS covered on slide 9 and 10. GFS Q4 segment revenue of $412 million was down 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Note that GFS revenue growth was negatively impacted by the non-recurrence of a year ago items across several of the geographic regions including a previously disclosed termination fee in GFS North America. 
GFS segment EBITDA of $184 million was up 6% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis as expenses decreased 6% compared to the prior year, driven by solid cost management execution, which more than offset our growth related investments in this business. Thanks to these efforts on the cost side, GFSâs reported margin improved 300 basis points to 44.7%. 
Letâs take a look at GFS by region; GFS North American revenue decreased 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a previously disclosed $7 million termination fee we received in the fourth quarter of 2016. The term fee was associated with business loss due to client M&A activity. Excluding this term fee GFS North American revenue was approximately flat year-over-year, as we experienced lingering weakness in our plastics business and some softening in the retail private label business. 
Moving to the international markets, GFS EMEA revenue grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis in Q4, driven by new business and internal growth in the UK, partly offset by some lumpy non-recurring revenue recognized in the prior year period. GFS Latin American revenue grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis in Q4, driven by internal growth in Argentina, partly offset by a favorable license fee resolution in the prior year period. GFS APAC grew 6% on an organic constant currency basis in the quarter with broad based growth. 
Looking back on the full year performance of GFS globally, revenue increased 3% on an organic constant currency basis, while EBITDA increased 8%. The year-over-year revenue growth was challenged primarily by a lower card personalization revenue in North America related to reduce demand for EMV chip cards in 2017 compared to 2016. 
The digital plastic volume comps are mostly behind us and as we look ahead in to the coming year, we expect to see some first half headwind associated with pricing compression from a handful of significant renewals that we recently signed, but remain confident that GFS global revenue growth with improve over the course of 2018, as we start to see the ramp up of new deals that weâve announced in this business over the past several quarters including [indiscernible]), Banco Sabadell, Huntington National Bank and First Citizens Bank amongst others. 
Please turn to slide 11 to cover NSS. NSS Q4 segment revenue of $406 million was up 4% on a reported basis or up 6% on an organic constant currency basis. NSS Q4 segment EBITDA was $209 million up 14% on both a reported an organic constant currency basis reflecting the combination of both good revenue growth and solid expense management. NSSâs reported margins improved 450 basis points to 51.5%. 
Let me break out the result by NSSâs three main business lines; EFT network solutions revenue were flat year-over-year as transaction growth was offset by lower blended yield; security and fraud solutions were up 4% in the quarter, reflecting low double digit growth in our core security business partly offset by continued decline Telecheck revenue. Stored value revenues were up 19%, driven by strong growth in our Clover and Gyft solutions business along with moderate growth in our money network payroll card business. Gyft Solutions saw a $7 million benefit in the quarter from a favorable client-contract modification.
Moving to free cash flow shown on slide 12, we think of free cash flow largely as cash flow from operations less CapEx and distribution to minority interest. We provide the reconciliation of cash flow from operations, two free cash flow in the appendix of the slide deck. This table on slide 12 walks you from total segment EBITDA to free cash flow. Free cash flow of $280 million in the quarter improved $10 million year-over-year reflecting improved operating results and lower cash interest payments largely offset by unfavorable timing impacts of settlement flows on working capital. Our full year 2017 free cash flow of $1.36 billion was up $143 million or 12% year-over-year. 
Now letâs discuss our balance sheet; slide 13 lays out our debt balance as of the end of 2017, end of third quarter 2017 and the end of 2016. Our net debt increased by $413 million this quarter as approximately $760 million in net consideration for BluePay in December was partly offset by free cash flow generated in the quarter.
In conjunction with the acquisition of BluePay, we raised $250 million of new term loan [a-debt] at a rate of LIBOR plus 175. We also utilized available lines of credit and cash on hand to fund the BluePay acquisition. We continue to actively manage our debt and during the quarter, we refinanced about $3.9 billion of term loans. We reduced the rate of these term loans by 25 basis points resulting in expected annualized cash interest savings of $10 million. Our leverage ratio defined as net debt-to-segment EBITDA was 6.0 times at December 31, unchanged from where it was at September 30 despite the acquisition of BluePay. This leverage ratio is down from 6.3 times at the end of 2016. 
Now Iâd like to cover a few important items that should help you with your models for 2018 and beyond. There are a couple of important issues Iâd like to address; first, Iâd like to discuss changes in our effective tax rate which are primarily driven by two discreet events that are going to affect our P&L starting at the same time. Those were the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with our US Federal NOL and US Tax Reform which was signed in to law in December of last year. And second, Iâll provide 2018 guidance. 
Itâs important to discuss the tax rate before we get to the guidance because of a material change in our effective tax rate which will significantly impact the comparability of year-over-year EPS results and I want to provide a clear foundation of how this impacts our 2018 guidance. 
Please turn to slide 14, where we provide a tax update including a discussion of our expected tax rate in 2018. Our Q4 GAAP results were distorted by multiple discreet tax items booked in the period, the most prevalent resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance I just mentioned. The multiple discreet tax items triggered the recording of non-cash net tax benefits in Q4 and for the full year. Given the unique nature of the items, they are excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted EPS in the quarter and full year. 
In 2017, excluding the discreet items, our effective tax rate for purposes of calculating adjusted net income was roughly 10%. Prospectively as a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance, First Data will now begin recording a normalized book effective tax rate starting in Q1 2018. Note that due to our NOL carry forward, this increase in effective tax rate does not affect cash taxes. So the next question is what will be our normalized effective tax rate in 2018?
Itâs important to understand that prior to tax reform, we estimate that our effective tax rate would have been in the range of 37% to 39%. However, with the enactment of tax reform, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be in the range of 27% to 29%. Set differently, First Data benefited from tax reform by about 10 percentage points on our effective tax rate or the equivalent of roughly $0.20 on our diluted EPS. Separately I want to explain why our 2018 tax rate guidance of 27% to 29% is above the new US Federal headline rate of 21%. The difference is primarily driven by limitations on interest deductibility and state and local taxes. 
While we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will fall in to the 27% to 29% range, we are confident that we can bring this rate down further to around 25% over the medium term. I want to emphasize that the reversal of the valuation allowance and the enactment of the tax reform have no impact on the nominal value of our US Federal NOL carry forward, which stands at approximately $4.5 billion at the end of 2017. Because of the sizable NOL, we expect to be largely shielded from US Federal cash taxes through the end of 2020, meaning at least the next three years. 
So now letâs move to our full year 2018 financial guidance; Iâd like to start with two important notes about our guidance, first revenue and EBITDA growth guidance is provided on a constant currency basis. That simply means that we assume that foreign exchange rates hold constant versus comparable prior year period. Second, our headline revenue and EBITDA growth estimates include the net benefit of a full yearâs impact of previously announced acquisitions and dispositions in 2018. So these growth rates are not stated on an organic constant currency basis, but rather on a reported constant currency basis. 
Note that we do provide an estimate of the net benefit to our reported constant currency growth guidance from previously announced acquisitions and dispositions to allow you to clearly understand what organic growth guidance is as well. We chose to provide our headline guidance on the reported constant currency basis, because we have not publicly disclosed 2017 revenue and EBITDA metrics that are pro formed for a full 12 months of acquisitions and divestitures. So we want to ensure that we are providing guidance on a basis that is applicable to disclose 2017 actuals. 
And for every quarter in 2018, we will continue to report our growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis as we did on slide 5 and 6 this quarter. Now our guidance for full year 2018, we expect to achieve reported constant currency revenue growth of 5% to 7%. This range includes about 2 percentage points of net growth attributable to the full year impact of previously announced acquisitions and dispositions. 
We expect to achieve reported constant currency EBITDA growth of 7% to 9%. This range includes about 1.5 percentage points of net growth attributable to the full year impact of previously announced acquisitions and dispositions. We expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.40. Our 2018 EPS guidance is below the $1.52 of adjusted EPS that we reported for full year 2017, however, given the significant increase in our effective tax rates between 2017 and 2018 that I discussed earlier, the decline in headline adjusted EPS is not an apples-to-apples comparison and clearly not indicative of the companyâs expected underlying earnings growth. Said differently, using a comparable tax rate in both periods implies solid underlying diluted EPS growth. 
We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $1.04 billion in 2018 and to continue to strengthen our financial position by paying down debt. Finally, we once again reaffirm our medium term guidance of mid-single digit organic revenue growth, mid-to-high single digit organic EBITDA growth, continued growth in free cash flow and target a leverage ratio that approaches four times by the end of 2019. 
In closing, we feel very good about our business and financial outlook, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our near term and medium term growth goals. 
With that let me hand it back to the operator to open up the call for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. 
Jason Kupferberg
Itâs nice to see the improvement in the North America JVs in terms of the key metrics there. I just wanted to get a sense of â I know it could be a little lumpy going forward, but how soon is it realistic that the JVs could turn positive from a revenue perspective again. 
Frank Bisignano
So why donât I start, I think first of all you saw us renew PNC. I think thatâs a statement about where those partnerships are. I feel itâs on course to how we thought things would work with our partners that being PNC, Bank of America and Wells. All of our time inside at the senior most level to both the banks and ourselves is about the next turn here and that turn is about digital and how we embed a better digital experience to drive that. 
And so we think stabilization occurred clearly, and youâre going to see us reinvesting with our partners who are completely committed and youâll see a steady drumbeat of progress. We talked about the lumpiness because we really donât think itâs a quarter-to-quarter item as much as a long term trajectory item that we saw the worst days of it and both the partners and ourselves are committed to digital forward growth, automation, Clover and all the investments weâve made in the SMB suite and growing these businesses.
Himanshu Patel
Jason I would just add to Frankâs comment that weâve previously talked about one of the key items that affects revenue growth, not the only one, but one of the major ones is lead flow. The rate of lead flow in the fourth quarter improved year-over-year slightly, a lot that was because of an easier comparison. But that is the beginning of stabilization happening. We have talked about approximately 6 to 9 months lag from when we see lead flow improvement to that translating into a commensurate benefit on revenue, holding all other revenue variables constant. And so I think that gives you a little bit of a sense of what weâre thinking about on timing. 
Jason Kupferberg
Thatâs helpful; I mean it sounds like thereâs some comfort that at least the worst is over there. And then Himanshu can you help us think through some of the revenue growth expectations for â18 by segment as you deconstruct it into the three pieces?
Himanshu Patel
I would say overall if you looked at this year 2017 itsâ reasonably indicative in the three global divisions were basically 3% to 4% all three of them, two of them were 4%, one was 3% and as a company we pushed it 4%. And so you can see we donât tend to have significant dispersion around total company growth by division and we expect something comparable for 2018. 
Operator
And the next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
Steven Kwok
This is actually Steven Kwok filling in for Sanjay. First question is just around the PNC merchant services renewal, congrats on that. How does the economics of that deal look versus the prior one? And then also are there any upcoming large renewals that you have, when do the other JVs contract expire?
Frank Bisignano
I think first Iâd look at PNC was working on modernizing the JV. You heard me talk a lot about modernization and renovation. I think sometimes people wonder what that means. It means embedded set of changes even including how the bank and us run the JV. So I would look at it as achieving both sidesâ objectives to getting more nimbler JV that continue to grow and invest in innovation. It wasnât early renewal, but that wasnât early renewal because we were talking constantly about how to do our work better. And the output of it was a series of changes to how we operate and I put it as a big check plus in terms of how the bank and us both feel at the senior most levels. 
The other two JVs with the oldest one coming up in 2020, the other in 2019. I think you got to look at them as constant dialog about how we grow the business and how we do things. And across all the company weâre always going to have a lot of renewals. You heard us talk about some today. I mean it is very normal and a recurring revenue business for us to have 10%-15% on an annual basis. When we got here we kind of renewed a large part of the GFS but which was extraordinary at that point in time.
Prior to that if you remember that business, the US business was up for sale. We took it off the market, we renewed a large part of it and you see us continuing to renew business. That would be a constant drumbeat within the company. Itâs normal for us and it will change year-to-year how much there is of it. 
Steven Kwok
Got it. And my follow-up question is just around, your guidance on a constant currency basis. Can you talk about how we should think about currency impacts in 2018 as it stands right now? 
Himanshu Patel
Obviously thatâs a forecast. We expect just given kind of where currency rates are projected right now, call it roughly a $20 million benefit to revenue on a full year basis and no impact to EBITDA. 
Operator
And the next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.
Darrin Peller
Putting aside the JV channel and the rest of GBS North America, can you just comment on the trend there, I know your period last year where it was obviously growing and then it decelerated a bit but retention and just overall growth of the SMB channel, especially pro forma for CardConnect and BluePay?
Frank Bisignano
Yeah, maybe Iâll talk a little bit about whatâs going on across the board there, and I will dive in to a couple deeper. Like I said the CardConnect acquisition, the integration of our [Asian] [ph] business, the old Ignite business and the CardConnect [Asian] [ph] business has come together. Thatâs under one leadership, the technical consolidation on the backend has happened and you could look forward to that channel distributing Clover during the course of this year in the ISV channel during the course of this year distributing Clover. And we highlighted some of the facts there, thatâs off to a fabulous start. 
BluePay is as good a property as we thought it was and the bringing together of the parts of BluePay, CardConnect and First Data are completely coming together. We feel very good that our attrition rates in our own portfolio have normalized and stabilized and be performing at industry. The real play there in the future is getting our new signed up RSA partners up and running and delivering more, being able to bring digital into that channel as weâve talked about. 
And so thatâs really how we see the future growth there. Itâs very, very strong from a quantitative and a qualitative standpoint on our offering, on our products, on partner receptivity. So I think when we look at it, itâs probably the best we felt about the business itself and the direction itâs headed in. 
Himanshu Patel
Darrin, I would agree with Frankâs comment. The non-JV channel is doing very well, little bit hard to see in numbers quarter-to-quarter because of some [indiscernible]), but on an underlying basis weâre seeing very solid double-digit growth in both CardConnect and BluePay. Weâre seeing an SMB Direct business that is still not growing but definitely approaching stabilization and enterprise business that is posting very healthy growth. 
Darrin Peller
And then Himanshu just very quickly on the strategic use of capital now, I mean I know you guys were obviously delivering and still are, but you saw a couple of acquisitions last year that clearly helped your position but also may have been surprised to versus deleveraging. So now that weâre looking at â18, do you have the full suite or Frank if you want to answer, do you have a full suite of what [indiscernible]) in North America or are we expected to see more tuck-ins?

First Iâd go that perhaps first and foremost the use of cash as to de-lever. We had always thought that the ISV channel was of interest the way we were building it out. The fact that we were able to get what we viewed as the two best properties that were available which were CardConnect and BluePay was a pause and we thought would be better for our long term growth trajectory and ultimately for shareholder value and thatâs why we did that part. We feel good about the GBS North American and the way it is right now. 
Himanshu Patel
Darrin you can see that both of those transactions that we did this last year, I think we tried to be very thoughtful of how much leverage we would take on and did it actually solve anything strategically. We still despite those deals closed up the year at six times lever. We started the year at 6.3 on a two-three year trajectory to de-lever the balance sheet so roughly four times by the end of â19. We think both of those acquisitions will show up as a blip, nothing significant, and going forward our objective is still to reach that four times number.

And the next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI.
David Togut
On GFS looks like 1% organic revenue growth if we adjust out for the year ago benefit on 6% AOF growth. Can you comment on unit pricing outlook in GFS and why do you continue to see significant unit pricing pressure?
Himanshu Patel
David the Accounts On File growth is an overall Accounts on File growth number. We did see some softness in our retail private label business where the gross active accounts which tends to be the more primary revenue driver there as opposed to Accounts on File that has softened up a little bit, and thatâs really the big disconnect. Itâs not a disconnect on per card pricing. 
David Togut
So in terms of unit pricing what are you seeing in North America?
Himanshu Patel
Hard to answer that question generically because I think each contract is different. I would say we are not seeing anything materially different from where it was a year ago. Obviously, if you undergo a renewal in GFS for seven year deal or five year deal, if the client is buying the same exact mix of product again, you do take price compression upon the time you see that renewal. But absolute pricing when you sign up a new client I would say it doesnât feel that different to us.

And the next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen.
George Mihalos
Himanshu, wanted to go back to the GBS JVâs and I think you said that lead flow had turned positive low-single digits. Is there a certain growth rate in the lead flow that we need to see before the JVs can turn positive assuming that attrition pricing will be other stuff and existing portfolio stays constant?
Himanshu Patel
No, I donât think we would want to put out a number like that, because lead flow is one of the key metrics, probably the key metric we are looking at right now. But obviously thereâs many, many things that go in to First Data has reported JV revenue growth. I would remind everyone that our lead flow count in the fourth quarter of 2017 was very easy. So while we did see slightly positive year-over-year growth lead flow from an absolute level, those leads are still not acceptable or healthy from our perspective. And that growth rate number is going to â we anticipate that it will bounce around for the next few quarters. 
I do think â just when I think of absolute lead flow by quarter, we are down double digit from where we were in 2016, and so I think that gives you a little bit of sense of the magnitude of the ultimate recovery needed to get the business back to an absolute number that we would consider acceptable. I would take the growth, the slight growth we saw in lead flow in Q4 as an encouraging but modest step towards stabilization, thereâs obviously a lot to get through between now and sort of the ultimate growth in that business.
George Mihalos
And then in the free cash flow guide for â18, I think the 1.4 billion, thatâs pretty much in line with what you guys did in 2017. Is there something keeping that back?
Himanshu Patel
No. First Data like probably any other company, free cash flow is probably incredibly volatile compared to most of the other metrics. So, we obviously put a number out there that was a little bit above our actuals for 2017 to give a sense, we do expect it to be better. But you could have some volatility over the course of the year that is hard to predict. It is not intended to indicate any sort of lack in FCF conversion between EBITDA and free cash flow. We still think we have a very cash generative model, low CapEx, virtually no federal cash taxes in the US. But things like working capital, settlement timing, those things do tend to cause a little bit of lumpiness.

And the next question comes from Tim Willy with Wells Fargo. 
Tim Willy
Iâve two questions, firstly, just sort of quasi modelling Himanshu. As we think about the margin and that sort of the expansion applied between revenue and EBITDA and you guidance in the medium term. How much of the book to margin expansion which you now pin on revenue mix and organic growth versus a lot of sort of the restructuring and sort of internal cost efforts that you have been undertaking over the last couple of years.
Himanshu Patel
Itâs a great question Tim. Itâs definitely both, and I donât have a spilt handy for you because obviously geographic mix of business, the product mix of business all of that also goes in to the margin not just the absolute percentage growth at revenue. But I think it is fair to say at a qualitative level if we are a business that does low 40% EBITDA margin in 2017, we do expect our contribution margins to be above that level assuming constant product mix, constant geographic mix. And thatâs just good old fashion operating leverage from the guided revenue growth on organic drop in to the bottom line. 
On top of that though I think you did see a very nice amount of margin expansion in Q4 specifically, and I think that is indicative of the fact that we are continuing to find additional efficiency opportunities and instead of a steady journey in this company, I wouldnât say itâs won and done. And so I would expect that to be a contributing factor as well to 2018 anticipated margin guidance. 
Tim Willy
And my follow-up was just on Clover which sounds like continue to set up nice. 
Himanshu Patel
Tim your voice broke up there, I donât know if youâre still on the line or not. We can barely hear you. Try again your second question.
Tim Willy
With Clover in the developer community in terms of just how that continues to build or are you seeing some increased sort of demand or interest from developers about becoming part of that program and sort of thinking about the content and the ecosystem at Clover?
Frank Bisignano
We clearly feel Clover is a platform, its demonstrated that platform capability in the ecosystem. I think what we see is our next large pivot there and weâre working diligently on supporting the ISV community with Clover and thatâs another form of the development community. When we first came out with Clover you saw us appealing to the individual development communities and running a series of apps which attracted a lot of development and had very good ecosystem effect. 
What we learned through that journey was that the ISV community is probably the best software community to support, and we found that them seeing Clover as an option as oppose to a competitors became very strong, and thatâs the thing that youâll see during 2018. So very strong, very good, we brought out a new version of Clover station which is give receptivity and you will continue to run stably and build out that platform.

And the next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.
Bryan Keane
Just wanted to ask about NSS maybe by segment, what the outlook might be in EFT network revenue security and fraud and stored value? And then secondly my second question was on interest expenses, whatâs a good number from [indiscernible]) purposes going forward for this year?
Himanshu Patel
Bryan, I think what you saw this quarter, you saw a flattish EFT business, which is the combination both our star business as well as the processing in the United States. You saw mid-single digit growth in security and fraud and both of our store value business were up even if you exclude the client contract modification. I think thatâs reasonably representative of probably weâre thinking about next year. 
We probably expect some modest growth in the EFT network, but debit processing is a more competitive business than credit processing and most other issue of processing businesses. Our security and fraud is a really good growth business, but remember included in our security and fraud business is a Telecheck business which obviously has more of a secular decline. So I think thatâs sort of mid-single digit growth number you saw for that business. 
On a reported basis, it is reasonably representative. And the prepaid business is what we call stored value growth, stored value network those are clearly growth businesses for us both Gyft and the Money Network Open Loop business. Both have very strong secular tailwinds and we probably had said both of those to probably be some of the stronger performers within NSS.
Bryan Keane
Just on interest expense, Himanshu what should we expect for modelling purposes?
Himanshu Patel
Book interest expense, I would expect a modest decline call it roughly $10 million in 2018 versus 2017. 2017 was $937 million. The reason for that modest decline is multiple items going in and out of that. You get a full yearâs benefit of deleveraging which obviously takes the interest expenses down. But then that is partly offset because you have a full year of acquisition impact related leverage. Remember we only owned CardConnect for half of last year and BluePay for only 1/12th of last year. We had a full 12 months of the interest burden of those acquisitions in 2018 and we are also assuming interest rates are rising for the forward curve and all thatâs embedded in that 10 million decreased guidance.

And the next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.
Ashwin Shirvaikar
Can I ask you to provide a bit of macro commentary in terms of what your spend trend expectations are as you look at major geographies and what sort of improvement is embedded in your high expectations?
Himanshu Patel
Not sure I completely follow, but I think if youâre looking at our spend trend report; I would not use that as an analogy for anything related to our publicly reported results. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar
No, not the spent end report specifically. I was asking about macro commentary on what consumer spending expectations you have embedded in your [indiscernible]).
Himanshu Patel
Fair question. So obviously we have a total company revenue growth guidance that weâve given of 5% to 7% increase being the benefit of the two acquisitions. You can see that includes two points of acquisition related benefit. We generally think that when we take the collective of all of our businesses together, we have a core unit volume growth in the industry in the United States of Visa, Master Card volume transactions, which we think are sort of mid-to-high single digits. And then our mix of business as well as some issues related to pricing in various geographies. We think all of that nets back down to our guided revenue growth. 
Ashwin Shirvaikar
And then as I look at the impact of global accounting change going away is that roughly a 2% headwind and are there any other one-time type impacts to consider as well.
Himanshu Patel
Yes, so under the new revenue recognition standard whatâs known as ASE 606, the Clover accounting item that affected our 2017 results will become a non-event. In addition to several other accounting changes that happened and maybe Iâll take a moment to just comment on the impact of the revenue recognition standards. 
So the impact of the 606 revenue recognition standards, we expect them to be immaterial to our full year 2018 guidance growth rate, when applied to a restated 2017 actual segment results. That you will get from us in an 8-K shortly, call it in the next month or so, restated 2017 numbers on the new revenue recognition standard for both revenue and EBITDA. We expect the nominal numbers to change, but we do not anticipate any impact on our guidance which is expressed on a growth rate basis from that.

And the next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James Friedman 
In light with some of the capital markets activity, I wanted to ask you about Latin America. Nielsen has top five acquired depending from the market in Latin America. I remember [Gustavo] had a presentation at the Analyst Day describing what he was targeting. Could you kind of contextualize whatâs the end objective with your Latin America business? Do you run it for growth, because itâs such a growth market or margin? And at some point given the valuations down there, might have make sense to look to at least partially monetize that. 
Frank Bisignano
Weâve invested probably from â13 to date on building our play in America. So weâve done a fair amount of investing that is now showing the benefit. I think its greater Brazil, I think we feel good about Argentina, we feel good about Columbia. And if you ask us are we investing for growth, Iâd say, weâre investing for growth to create shareholder value, to build a franchise that can compete at the highest level, and take market share, and thatâs really what youâve seen us do there, and we intend to continue to do.
That question you asked about given valuations in that market [Technical Difficulty]. I [indiscernible]) to comment if you can hear over music, because I think itâs really important. Thereâs large part of this company that grow well and perform well. We like running it in to greater property and weâll always think about what to do in the future. 
I apologize for the music on the line, and Iâd like to thank everyone for dialing in for todayâs call. We enjoyed talking to you and appreciate the opportunity. We thank you for your support and ownership and look forward to talking to you a little better over the next few days, and certainly thank you.
