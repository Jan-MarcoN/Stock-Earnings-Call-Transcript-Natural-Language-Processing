John Hart
Thank you, Moira. Thank you for joining our call this morning. I would like to make some brief comments on our operations before opening the call to any questions you may have on our 2015 earnings release. The markets for our water assets continue to improve in 2015. The Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada estimated that the region will generate 51,000 jobs from 2015 to 2019. Currently, Renoâs unemployment rate has improved from 6.5% at December 2014 to 5.5% as December 2015.
In addition to Tesla, there have been numerous announcements from companies such as Switch, Jet.com and eBay to set up operations in the region. This job in population growth has resulted in a 33% year-over-year increase in 2015 for building permits of single family homes in the Reno, Sparks area, and approximately 18% year-over-year increase in Nevada as a whole.
Subsequent to the release of The Economic Development Authority report, the North Valleys area of the Reno metropolitan area, where the Reno State Airport is located has been the subject of discoveries related to various development projects in the permitting process totaling 15,000 units and in excess of 500 acres of commercial industrial and mixed use property. In addition to Reno Tahoe Airport Authority has authorized its staff to enter into a memorandum of understanding with industrial and commercial developers for a master development agreement at the Reno State Airport.
The agreement provides for Phase 1 development of 90 acres. These developments could potentially require use of an additional 1,500 acre feet of water, also recently announced our plans for a major industrial park and an intermodal rail center in the Fernley area of Lyon County. The development of the industrial park and rail center is expected to be a significant investment in the Western Nevada economy as well as being a further draw for companies locating to Northern Nevada.
There are several market catalysts emerging with respect to our long-term storage credits in Arizona including the recent drought in the western U.S., the continued structural deficits on the Colorado River system, Indian Tribe Firming and Settlement obligations by the State of Arizona and increased water demand from overall growth in Arizona. We are in discussions with multiple parties to potentially acquire our credits.
In the fourth quarter, UCP realized improvement in nearly every aspect of their business. They reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $7.6 million exceeding The Streetâs $3 million estimate. Revenue of $107 million surpassed consensus of $77 million. During 2015, UCP grew its year-over-year homebuilding revenue by approximately 62% to $252.6 million with 701 homes delivered, while decreasing its year-over-year G&A expenses by approximately 1.9% to $26.9 million.
At December 31, 2015, UCPâs backlog was approximately $109 million, which positions them well for continued growth in 2016. For more detailed information I would recommend that you review their fourth quarter earnings presentation available on their website. Congratulations to Dustin and his team for a successful year.
As we have previously announced, a shareholder owning approximately 1.5% of our stock has made a demand for a special meeting in an effort to replace the majority of our Board of Directors. For more information on this matter, we refer you to the definitive consent revocation statement that we filed with The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2016.
We will not be commenting further on this matter during todayâs earnings call and we request that the question-and-answer period remain focused on our fourth quarter and 2015 year-end results and PICOâs new strategic direction, which contemplates that as and when we monetize assets, we intend to return all such proceeds, less any working capital requirements to our shareholders through a stock repurchase program or through other means such as special dividends. A plan that was driven not only by the fact that the markets for our water assets appear to have moved in our favor, but that our stock is trading at a significant discount to our estimate of intrinsic value and at a discount to stated book value.
I would now like to open the call for any questions you might have or if you would prefer please call a Trish Pullara at 858-652-4130 to schedule a call with us. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Deysher of Pinnacle. Please go ahead.
John Deysher
Hi, good morning. I donât know if this question is beyond the scope of the call or not, but it is part of your documents filed back on the 25th, you indicated that you were going to de-stager the board. And we applaud that and we were curious exactly how you intend to do that.
John Hart
There has not been a decision on how the board will be de-staggered, but it is our intention to have a vote on de-staggering the board at the Annual Meeting.
John Deysher
Okay. I think good governance would suggest that the de-staggering occur immediately and that each of the directors stands for reelection as opposed to rolling off depending on how many years in their term they have left?
John Hart
We will certainly include your comments in the Boardâs consideration.
John Deysher
Thank you.
Operator
And this concludes our call for today. Iâd like to thank you all for joining todayâs presentation and you may all disconnect your lines. Have a fantastic day. Thank you.
