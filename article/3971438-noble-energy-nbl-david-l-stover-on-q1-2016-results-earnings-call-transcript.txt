Please stand by. We're about to begin. Good morning, and welcome to Noble Energy's First Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.
Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Levi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we issued our first quarter 2016 operational and financial news release, and we also posted a number of supplemental slides to our website. You will find them helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be filed with the SEC.
Following prepared comments from Dave Stover, Chairman, President and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations, we'll open the call for a Q&A session. In order to meet our one hour timeframe, we would ask that participants limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up question. Additional management members available for Q&A are Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; Susan Cunningham, EVP, Exploration and New Ventures; and Keith Elliott, SVP of our Eastern Mediterranean business.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call may contain projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. If you've had a chance to look at our earnings release and conference call slides this morning, I think you'll agree that we had a tremendous operating quarter and a very solid start to 2016. We began the year with these key goals: protect the balance sheet, align cash outflows with cash inflows, leverage the benefits of our diversified portfolio, and optimize returns with enhanced completion. First quarter results show we are delivering on each of these objectives.
Before going into our results, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the current environment. With the U.S. rig count at a record low, significantly lower investment is translating into production declines in the majority of unconventional basins. It is my hope that we will continue to see capital discipline throughout the industry regarding activity levels. Even if we see sustained higher commodity prices, any meaningful U.S. production impact from increased industry activity is likely to take several months from initial investment decisions.
Outside North America, non-OPEC major project deferrals are beginning to add up to at least a few million barrels per day through 2020. While there have been early indications of a potential commodity price turn, I expect commodities will continue to show volatility day-to-day and week-to-week. Regardless, no matter what commodity environment persists, it is clear to me, Noble Energy is well positioned to sustain and create long-term value for its shareholders.
Moving to our results, we continued to lower both our capital and underlying cost structure in the first quarter. This was primarily the result of impressive and sustainable efficiency gains in our U.S. onshore business. Capital expenditures were below the low end of our guidance and decreased for a sixth consecutive quarter as we managed within cash flow. We came in well below guidance on most of our key cost metrics. Total lease operating expense and general and administrative costs in the first quarter of 2016, which included Rosetta, were flat in an absolute amount compared to a Noble-only first quarter of 2015. This is a powerful indication of our cost reduction efforts when you consider the company added almost 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over that same period. Excluding the Isabela workover, unit lease operating expense was down 34% from the first quarter of last year.
At the same time, we exceeded the high end of our volume guidance with 416,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day sold in the first quarter. This is up more than 30% in total and 8% pro forma for the Rosetta merger versus the same quarter last year. Compared to guidance, oil was higher, NGLs was higher and so was gas. This was achieved by impressive productivity improvements in the U.S. with new completions, record first quarter sales volumes in Israel, and reduced downtime at Alba in Equatorial Guinea. In fact, every core area is delivering or exceeding our plans so far in 2016.
Execution stood out in the DJ Basin position, where completion optimization and longer laterals drove 34% growth in Wells Ranch and East Pony production compared to the same quarter of last year. And in the Delaware Basin, where we're just getting started, third party analysis of state data indicates Noble Energy has the highest productivity per lateral foot in the basin this year.
Equally as important, we maintained our robust financial position, ending the quarter with $5 billion in liquidity. Since quarter end, we have executed asset sales transactions totaling nearly $550 million, including the transaction announced yesterday. Combined with first quarter proceeds received, we will have generated total proceeds of over $775 million so far in 2016. The Greeley Crescent transaction significantly accelerates the value of this acreage for Noble Energy. It is an area that would not have been developed for some time as we are currently focused on higher value areas within the DJ Basin. Gary will talk more about this shortly.
Our continuous focus on disciplined capital allocation and prudent balance sheet management did not go unnoticed by the rating agencies. We not only maintained our investment grade rating at Moody's and S&P, but received an initial investment grade rating from Fitch as well. Ken and the treasury team do a great job continuing engagement with the rating agencies, and I believe we are one of only four of our peers with investment grade ratings across the board.
Our strong underlying performance, the recent upward move in commodity prices, and announced proceeds from asset sales position us to generate significant excess cash in 2016, and give us more flexibility for the future. At current prices, we continue to be focused on balance sheet strength and the opportunity to pay down debt. As commodity prices move and sustain above $50 per barrel, we will begin to consider additional capital allocation to the U.S. unconventional business, with initial focus on our low cost and liquid rich assets in the DJ Basin in Texas. We've continued the trend of improving our performance in the first quarter and I'm confident there is much more to come.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Willingham.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we've continued with very high levels of operating momentum in the early part of the year, particularly in the U.S. onshore business. The level of engagement by our entire organization to continuously drive efficiencies throughout the business is certainly apparent, and realized drilling time reductions and enhanced productivity in all of our basins.
The DJ Basin, once again, delivered production outperformance at lower costs. First quarter production totaled 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, we reduced normalized extended-reach lateral well costs to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch, down 35% from the first quarter of 2015 despite utilizing higher proppant concentrations. This decrease is the result of intense focus on drilling and completion execution, and utilizing the best rigs and the best crews in the basin.
We continue to shift our well design to include more monobore drilling, which provides many benefits, particularly for the combination of longer laterals and slickwater fracs. On the first 35 monobore wells we've drilled, we're observing reduced drill times of 1.5 days to 2.5 days or 30%, the ability to eliminate gel and tow stages in the long laterals, and finally, the monobores also provide more options for future well interventions.
Completion design continues to evolve rapidly and is paying off in impressive well productivity. You can see on slide five, the average IP-30 rate per lateral foot was up more than 30% from the same period a year ago. And the liquids content of the well, which came online in 2016, is higher than in prior years. This productivity improvement reflects both a shift to slickwater fluid, as well as enhanced proppant loading. Both Noble Energy's and third party infrastructure have been performing well, keeping line pressures low throughout the field. A planned turnaround at our Wells Ranch Central Processing Facility was completed in April. This was part of routine maintenance and is the first since the facility startup three years ago.
Yesterday, we announced a transaction to sell approximately 33,000 net acres from our Greeley Crescent area, which is located on the western side of our DJ acreage position. Representing about half of our acreage in Greeley Crescent, the transaction accelerates value to Noble Energy from an area which was not in our development plan for many years. Our strategy is to focus on areas with higher oil content, where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through long lateral development and existing infrastructure. Greeley Crescent is an area with very little production and horizontal drilling history and the transaction highlights the strong value of undeveloped acreage in the DJ Basin. Total proceeds are expected to be $505 million.
In Texas, we continued to deliver results that confirm our high quality positions in both the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin. Drilling times are down 20% from prior performance on these assets, and we announced several exciting well results this morning. Results from our first two Delaware completions in Reeves County are impressive. The average IP-30 rate of over 320 barrels of oil equivalent per thousand lateral feet is nearly 15% better than the prior average on these assets.
I want to turn your attention to slide seven, which provides more details. These first wells validate our Tier 1 Wolfcamp A position across the eastern and western extent of the acreage. The Calamity Jane well in the east is performing significantly above Noble's 700,000 barrel type curve, with oil production in line and gas showing material outperformance. We are also pleased to see our western extension test, the Soapy Smith well, performing consistent with the Tier 1 type curve. These outstanding results right out of the gate demonstrate the transferability of our U.S. onshore completion expertise, and we will continue to delineate the acreage position while further optimizing completions this year.
In the Eagle Ford, we're seeing early success bringing our improved completion designs from South Gates Ranch to new areas, unlocking additional resource potential. As slide eight indicates, the two Briscoe Ranch wells brought on during the quarter are materially outperforming the 400,000 barrel type curve you can see on the chart. In fact, they're actually outperforming even a 1 million barrel type curve.
These wells had an average lateral length of 4,900 feet and were completed with 2,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot. The better performing well was designed with tighter cluster spacing. In March, we brought online six Gates Ranch wells which tested various spacing and completion concepts. We're just now seeing production post cleanup, and these wells will drive significant volume growth in Texas during the second quarter.
In the Marcellus, exceptional operational performance continues to ensure deliverability of base production. We remain well aligned with our partner to be cash flow neutral in the joint venture in 2016, and we'll continue to be flexible with completion activity for the remainder of the year.
We started the year strongly in the Gulf of Mexico with Big Bend and Dantzler contributing 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Noble Energy during the quarter. This drove Gulf of Mexico oil volumes up almost 100% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. In addition, the Isabela workover was completed ahead of schedule, and Gunflint continues to progress toward a midyear 2016 startup. We recently commenced drilling an appraisal well at Katmai. This well will test resource upside to the 40 million to 60 million barrels of oil equivalent already discovered, and we anticipate results early in the fourth quarter.
Sales volumes in West Africa averaged 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong underlying performance at Aseng and Alen continued during the quarter, and at Alba, installation of the new B3 compression platform was carried out with fewer downtime days than expected. Commissioning and startup of the compression platform, which will enhance full field recovery, remains on schedule for midyear.
In Israel, natural gas sales volumes averaged 266 million cubic feet of gas per day. This represents an increase of nearly 10% from the same period last year despite mild weather experienced thus far in 2016. With the Israeli government's mandate to reduce coal fire generation by 15% year-over-year, we've seen consistent incremental coal to gas switching on the order of 50 million cubic feet per day gross with potential upside to that number.
Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Gary. Before providing details on our adjusted guidance, I'd like to take a moment to provide a further update on our Israel project. Tamar's production growth, resilient cash flows and access to significantly undersupplied markets make it one of the most attractive assets in the world. Leviathan is the same quality asset on an even larger scale with a total recoverable resource of 22 trillion cubic feet of gas based on multiple appraisal wells drilled and a production test as well.
In late March, Israel's Supreme Court acknowledged the strategic and national importance of these discoveries by upholding all but one of the provisions of the natural gas framework. The court recognized the importance of stabilization, but rejected the specific provision in the framework. We are engaged with the government as it works to timely address the Supreme Court's concern.
In the meantime, we continue to progress the other three critical requirements for Leviathan sanctions: financing, marketing and technical readiness. We are pleased that the Israeli National Planning Committee recently approved the location of the Leviathan platform and pipeline connection in Northern Israel. I am convinced that Leviathan, along with Tamar, will supply much needed gas for both Israel and the neighboring region for decades.
We've provided a full update to our 2016 guidance on slide 11. Normally, I wouldn't change our outlook so early in the year, but this reflects the high level of confidence I have in our strategy, assets, execution and ultimately, our future. Full year sales are now expected to average 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 4% from the original guidance with increased expectations for all three commodities. The production raise is based primarily on outperformance in the DJ Basin, Israel and West Africa. And on the capital side, we are trending on a path to come in under $1.5 billion. For the second quarter, capital is expected to be in line with the first quarter.
Sales volumes are anticipated to range between 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Volumes are expected to be impacted by seasonality in Israel and facility turnaround in the DJ Basin. This will be partially offset by significant quarter-over-quarter growth in Texas. We also expect higher volumes in West Africa as a result of Alba field production returning to full rate.
In summary, I continue to be pleased with the capital efficiencies generated across the business. Our financial strengths, asset quality, and onshore and offshore expertise give us a unique competitive advantage in any commodity environment.
At this time, Levi, why don't we go ahead and open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Congratulations on the asset sale last night. There's an echo in the line here. How should we think about asset sale targets for the year? Is there a program? And what is it you suppose you â to further bolster the balance sheet or improve your ability to reaccelerate?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, as far as potential sales, I think this was an opportunity where we saw that it could create more value for somebody else and essentially create more value for us by monetizing the asset. It was something that in our plans, we weren't going to be developing for a while given where it fit in the portfolio. So it made sense to move forward. I'd say when we look at things in general, it goes back to kind of what our philosophy has been as we've always looked at all parts of our portfolio. If we can create more value out of it than somebody else, then we're going to do that. If there's some reason that it can â we can realize more value from it by moving it to somebody else's hands, we'll look at that.
I think as we look at the year and what we've talked about previously, the one place where Noble continued to look at potential monetization of a portion of our business is over in Israel with Tamar, for example. We've talked about it as part of the framework that over six years, we'll look to bring down our interest from 36% to 25%. I'd say in the current environment, there's still a lot of interest in other folks wanting to get into that field. So there could be a possibility we might bring down some of our interest this year, but it's too early to say.
So, I would say that's the main one we're continuously focused on. Outside of that, we still have a big Midstream business that we've kept that S-1 active. And at some point in time, I think we'll see some real value, additional value, come out of that part of the business. So, that's kind of how I think about the portfolio. Most of it is all cored up. We don't have a lot of fringe pieces. But as in the case of this opportunity, if it makes sense to accelerate value, we'll look at it.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
My second question is similar. Your CapEx is trending well below in 1Q, and you gave a guide that was modestly lower. On the last year, many cycled those savings into higher activity. Are you considering recycling the lower CapEx in the market or you're â is this just in conjunction with asset sales continuing to improve the balance sheet?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think in this environment, and too early to see a sustained different price outlook at this point, I mentioned in the prepared comments, our initial focus, our primary focus is maintaining the strength of the balance sheet, so it gives us more flexibility and more opportunity there. I think as we see, and we'll see how it progresses through the year as we start to see more of a sustainable higher price environment, then we'll look at activity levels later in the year. But at this point, assuming we keep the same price outlook that we have right now, first priority is probably to continue to maintain the balance sheet. But I'd say one of the things we've done with the way we've looked at even our organization and how we've managed our business, we've maintained the capability to probably adjust relatively quickly as conditions change. So this just gives us more flexibility and optionality to do that over time.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Appreciate it, guys.

And we'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. I had a question on the Delaware Basin wells. Those look like really encouraging results, but I was really surprised by the relatively short length of the laterals. And I wonder if you can talk about your lease geometry there, whether it supports longer laterals and if and when those would become part of your development plan.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'll let Gary dive into that one, Charles, but I'd say I share your enthusiasm for the results, especially when you look at the fact that we tested two wells on â one on the far eastern side and one on the far western side of our continuous acreage, but let me turn that over to Gary.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, Charles, I'd say the length of those laterals is definitely tied more to kind of lease issues at the time they were drilled more than an indication of plans going toward. The Soapy Smith, certainly, the well on the west side is less than 2,800-foot lateral. That was actually drilled by Rosetta prior to the transaction and it was drilled to hold that particular lease. So I think as we continue to satisfy the remaining lease obligations in the area and move into more of a development phase going on, you'll see longer and longer laterals in those areas.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for that, Gary. And then the â my second question falls, I suppose, on the CapEx or use of proceeds of this Greeley Crescent sale. Your new guidance is for less than $1.5 billion. And I think that's probably nonspecific by design. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense for what the moving pieces are that would get you under $1.5 billion or if that's just simply a reflection of you coming in under in the first quarter. And if that $500 million is just going to kind of sit on the balance sheet or be there for the case where oil goes back over $50 or perhaps, it's used to pay down the term loan?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No, Charles, I think when you look at it â I'll go back to my comment that I usually don't like to change guidance this early in the year. But I think it's pretty obvious from the way our capital efficiency played out in the first quarter, the continued improvements we're seeing, especially in our onshore programs on what we're spending versus what we're getting, that we needed to indicate, at least directionally, where this was going to come. But I think as far as by design, we haven't given a specific number because we're keeping that flexibility as things change through the year. And all I'd say is on the planned activity, we're definitely on trend when you look at it to come in under the $1.5 billion and we'll see how the year plays out. As far as to your point, we've brought in some other proceeds. We're well positioned when it makes sense to increase activity, but we're not going to do that until we're comfortable and we've got a sustainable environment that supports it.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, Dave.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Good morning, Dave, and thanks for the commentary. One consistent theme that we have heard through earnings season is that $50 a barrel fulcrum point for potentially more activity. What do you forecast or what do you think the industry should forecast for increasing services costs in an accelerating environment?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's a good question, Dave. I think obviously, you would expect it's going to be driven by activity, and it's also going to be driven by the ability of the service sector to get the people back to work. So one of the things we've tried to do is maintain those relationships, especially in the key basins, so that we're kind of on the priority list for returning to work, if you will. Yeah, I don't have a real strong sense as to what's the magic price. I think it's going be more what's the magic amount of activity that starts to put more pressure on the service sector or the supply of available resource, and then we'll just have to see â it plays from there.
I think the one thing that's been encouraging from some of this is we've really focused on some of the efficiencies, and you've seen this from a number of folks, the other piece of that is that there's still a large piece of this that we're seeing probably 50% or more of our onshore cost reduction that we think is at least sustainable in a much higher price environment just from the way we've changed the way we're doing our business. Then when you look at the other part going forward, and here's where the diversified portfolio plays in, I think there's still a lot of room for offshore projects, especially new project cost to come down and stay down for a while, and not respond real quickly to any change.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC
Okay. Helpful perspective. Thanks, Dave.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Great. Good morning. Quick question. David, I appreciate all the comments on capital flexibility. Can you remind us, as we want to think forward to 6 months or 12 months from now and even into 2017, how do you think about your flexibility on capital? So can you just remind us what you think maintenance capital is for U.S. onshore business in this environment? And maybe any major project obligations you think you have, either Gulf of Mexico, West Africa or internationally, again, acknowledging that, that's all dependent on project sanction and everything? But how do you think about the flexibility around the program in 2017?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think we have tremendous flexibility in 2017, probably even more so than we had going into 2016. I think the only places that we're looking at as far as committed capital, if you will, when you start from a bottoms up, we have probably about a half year with our rig in the Gulf of Mexico and we have a few leases in the Texas properties that you'd want to drill to maintain your acreage position. But outside of that, we've got pretty much complete flexibility. So I think we've got a lot of room to make decisions based on whatever the environment turns out to be. I think as far as the maintenance piece, we kind of talked about that last time and I don't think our view on that's changed any.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Okay. Appreciate that. And maybe on Israel, one thing that would be interesting is, what are your current thoughts on the potential expansion of Tamar? I appreciate the comments on the potential monetization of that 11% working interest, but how do you think about the potential expansion projects and some of the things that have been discussed in the past, and where they sit in the priority queue particularly relative to Leviathan?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, well, I think a lot of the discussion has been, and what you'll see news on, is obviously getting this second big source of supply online. So that's been a lot of what the news focus has been on Leviathan. But if you step back and look at what's happening with Tamar, and I mentioned it or Gary or I both mentioned it, that you're seeing more of this push to move more of the power generation from coal to gas. We actually saw that show up in the first quarter. I think we're still being cautious about what we'll see for the rest of the year, but that's a near term positive impact for Tamar.
You still have the drive and the push from customers in Egypt to get gas, interruptible gas, as soon as that can be worked out. So I think when you look at both near and then the longer term market viability for both of those projects, it's a pretty exciting place to have that quality of opportunity when you think about the combination of the reservoir characteristics and the access to market over there for both of those, Tamar and Leviathan.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
I'm sorry, just one quick follow-up, David. So would you think that we would be in a position potentially to have an expansion of Tamar and concurrently, an FID and beginning of a project Leviathan at the same time in 2017 if everything lines up on the regulatory side?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
First, just because of the emphasis and the priority and the critical need to get that second big project on, I would continue to think of the Tamar expansion as probably following the Leviathan project.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah, good morning. I wanted to see if you guys could discuss the potential implications from an inventory perspective of some of the results that you shared at Briscoe Ranch.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Now, let me turn that over to Gary.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, Arun. I think the exciting thing about the results we're seeing at Briscoe is we've taken an area and significantly improved it by taking learnings from South Gates Ranch to a new area in the Eagle Ford. And of course, a lot of the success that we've had in South Gates Ranch improvement, and you're seeing it in the Delaware now, too, comes from our prior experience in the Marcellus and the DJ. And collectively, as a company, we've completed over 1,600 horizontal wells now. So we've got a lot of learnings under our belt.
I think specifically for that acreage and the inventory and the running room, Briscoe Ranch is a fairly small portion of the acreage. It's less than 5,000 acres, I think. But the exciting thing is there's other acreage nearby which we think a lot of those same improvements and completion designs can be applied to, and we can see a perhaps similar uplift to the results on those wells. So even though that block of acreage isn't huge, it certainly applies elsewhere. We've continued to have quite a bit of inventory still in South Gates Ranch, North Gates Ranch, and then obviously, in the Delaware, we're just getting started with the first two wells.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. I think, Gary, you guys have talked about 165 locations at Gates Ranch and 475 elsewhere within the Eagle Ford. So you think that perhaps some of the enhanced completions could maybe improve the well productivity on the balance outside of Gates Ranch?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Absolutely. I mean, I think the results that we've seen and, again, it goes back to what we've done on the DJ and the Marcellus, now the Eagle Ford and the Permian, where we've continued to see improvement in results as we've continued to refine completion techniques. I think what you're seeing now is certainly â bodes well for the potential of the future completions in those areas. I think the numbers you're citing there are still based on wider spacing, too. So to the extent that we continue to get better at confining the frac and stimulating more of the near wellbore rock, that potentially opens up tighter spacing over time, too, which would only add to the inventory count.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. And my follow-up is on the DJ. You talked about 30% kind of per lateral foot productivity gains. What also surprised me was just the oil mix in the new wells. So just wondering if you could maybe just talk to us on why you think the oil mix was higher. Was it related to mix? I know that the East Pony well was a little bit oilier, but could you maybe just talk through that? Because that is a pretty significant delta in terms of â versus the historical mix in the DJ.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, I mean â and the numbers on that slide are obviously over a three-year period. So it just goes to show why over the last couple years, we've really been talking a lot about refocusing activity in the best of the best, which is the higher oil content areas, Wells Ranch and East Pony. East Pony is by far the highest oil percentage acreage that we have in our portfolio, and that's where a large number of the wells that we're bringing on early part of this year were from, so that's partly driving that percentage up.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And, Gary, just in terms of the overall type curve, you have some decent history now on the DJ. When could you potentially declare victory on a higher type curve given the slickwater and some of the enhanced completions that you're doing on the DJ?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
I think certainly, by year end, we'll probably start talking about new EURs and new type curves. I think we're not done testing new ideas. We've only recently really ramped up the sand concentration in some of these wells and we've only done it on a few so far. So I think we'd like to get a few more of those under our belt and see some extended production history on some of these wells before we update the numbers. But clearly, from what we're seeing in the early time data, the results are very encouraging versus what we've talked about in the past.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
All right. Thanks a lot, Gary.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Morning. So, Dave, if I go back to that just $50 barrel type number, let's say Tamar, you get additional â let's say we go to $50, we stay there â or whatever the number is, you get an extra $300 million or $400 million of cash flow that you want to spend on CapEx. Where â I know you mentioned U.S. shale, but where specifically would that â how should we think about that allocation?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi. I think we'd continue to build out our DJ Basin, accelerate some of that inventory, and we'd probably ramp up and accelerate some of the Delaware Basin. I don't know. Gary, do you have any different view?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
No. I think that's where we'd focus.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then second, if I think about the Greeley acreage, I mean, any concern about some of the setback? And does that factor in the decision to sell that versus other parts of the DJ that you don't have a development timeframe?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. I think when you're looking at any other factors like setback or some of these other things, I think for us, the biggest reason we â we've sold that acreage was we felt somebody else could create more value out of it by accelerating than we were going create over time, and it actually increased our value because what we're focusing on and what we will be for a while here is where we have infrastructure in place, where we can drill longer laterals and where we have a higher oil content. So I mean, those are the reasons we made that transaction.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Company.
David Kistler - Simmons & Company
Good morning, guys. Real quickly, one of the comments on acceleration of activity, can you guys just give us a little bit of color in terms of after making personnel adjustments, what kind of a rig ramp you could prosecute? Or in some respects, I guess, that would be offset by the efficiencies you've seen as well. But maybe kind of a max rig count that the current staff could handle?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and I'll turn that over to Gary for some color, but that's one of the things we took into consideration as we looked at any adjustments in our organization, was to make sure we had the flexibility to go up or down within a reasonable range. So let me ask Gary to just give you more of his thoughts on that.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah. No, Dave, that's true. We did retain a decent amount of flexibility in our ability to ramp up activity when prices recover. So we're just running the two rigs in the DJ right now. We've got the capacity to handle a bit more activity there than two rigs when time is right. I think when you look at Texas, we're running off and on one rig total between the two areas, and we can certainly increase that activity a bit within the constraints of the current organization. So I think for any reasonable amount of activity increase that you would expect to see over the near term, we're fine.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And I think the other key thing with that, Dave, and I mentioned it earlier, is maintaining the relationships with the service providers so you can stay in the priority queue there.
David Kistler - Simmons & Company
Okay. Appreciate that. And then just looking at kind of the decline in well costs in the DJ Basin, obviously, completions have become more intense, and just trying to understand what the biggest driver of that is. I mean, we understand efficiency gains, but is there something you're doing differently that's allowing you to reduce the costs as dramatically as you were able to show this quarter?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, Dave, I mean, it's a lot of things. It's not one thing that's driving it. I mean, you certainly see it in the continuing improvement in the drilling performance where we continue to set records on a fairly consistent basis, taking a little bit of time off here and there of our previous records on drilling times. Slickwater has certainly been a driver of it as well.
Moving to monobore drilling has helped by taking a day, sometimes more than that, off of the wells as well, so â and then in Wells Ranch and East Pony where we've got existing infrastructure and the ability to drill those long laterals, which can drive your average cost per foot down as well, certainly help out. So we do have some things that are offsetting that as we're moving to higher and higher sand concentrations, and testing some tighter spacing in some areas, but the good news is we've been able to deliver enough efficiencies in all the other areas to more than offset that and continue to drive costs down.
As we mentioned in the press release, we're down to $2.7 million in Wells Ranch on an extended-reach, well-adjusted back to a normal lateral length, and that's with some of the impact of the higher completion costs from the higher sand loading. If you go back to more of a traditional type completion design that we might have had in the past, those costs are down more to the $2.4 million range. So great job by the teams in continuing to execute and look for efficiencies.
David Kistler - Simmons & Company
And maybe just one follow-up. Is any of that cost savings associated with using existing pads or would that be a step shift change as you go to that over time?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
I'd say very little, if any, of it's probably associated with that in the DJ. We don't have a lot of activity in the DJ where we go back to an existing pad and drill more wells given the type of acreage we've got there, being HBP, and the ability to plan that out around the infrastructure development plans. We generally go in and build a pad and drill it out from the beginning. So there might be some savings of that type come up in the Permian later on as we go back and move to a development mode there, but I wouldn't expect a lot of that in the DJ.
David Kistler - Simmons & Company
Super. I appreciate the added color, guys. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Jon Wolff with Jefferies.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Morning. Useful update. Noticing a gem in the press release that says that Noble acreage included in the transaction remains dedicated to Noble's â Noble Energy's Midstream business for oil and water gathering, as well as freshwater services. Is that something that could be contemplated within the Noble Midstream LP? And that's my first question.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'd say you're very observant, Jon. And there's...
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
There's not a lot. (43:25)
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, not a lot that we can talk about on that given that we still have that Midstream business plan sitting out there. But I â Ken, did you have anything to add?
Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. It will be that it maintained for the entity that's in the S-1, but we can't really comment on the S-1 while it's on file.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Did you give away any White Cliffs capacity or any other firm capacity out of the Basin?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
With the transactions?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. No, we didn't.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And the other thing that occurs to me is, could there be a vertical angle here for the buyer on development?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Vertical angle, meaning...
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Vertical drilling. It looks like a fairly untouched area.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I...
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Refracs or...
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not privy to the buyer's plan, so I wouldn't be able to speak to that.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Two more quick ones on Midstream. Have you done anything to change relationship on the Rosetta Eagle Ford assets? I know they had some dead acreage dedication, and a lot of processing contracts haven't been able to do anything to improve margins on some of the wet gas, NGLs, oil.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
No. I mean, we haven't made any significant changes to any of those contracts. Most of the dedication's in the Eagle Ford.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Okay.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
There's no significant changes there.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
And last one on the Reeves County infrastructure plan. Are we just way too early to think about that? Does the acreage have dedication?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
It's certainly not way too early to think about it. We've been thinking about it for a while. I think given the activity levels that we're at right now, you won't see us move to probably a full blown development mode until maybe starting next year. But we're certainly in the planning stages to make sure that when we have the level of activity to support that, that it's well thought out like we do in the DJ.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Last one on â in Israel, the ability to flex more gas into the system should there be a hot summer, is it a material amount or is it confined by what's going on regulatory-wise? I wouldn't think so.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. Keith can address how we look at our volumes and how much more capability we have there.
J. Keith Elliott - Senior VP-Eastern Mediterranean Region
Yeah. So, Jon, we're â Tamar has the capacity for a little over 1.1 Bcf a day if you look at kind of where were running in the first quarter there. We've still got some room to go. Typically, in the summertime, you get into the real heat of the summer, it's â we'll probably be maxed out and then, of course, IEC keeps some LNG capacity for basically topping up like that, but we've got some room to go.
Jonathan D. Wolff - Jefferies LLC
Thanks, Keith. Thanks for the good update.

And we'll go to our next question from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Good morning. This is perhaps a follow-on to an earlier question, but was just wondering, given the work being done in Israel to address the Supreme Court's concerns about the framework's stability language, do you think you still need to spend the full $100 million there that you budgeted?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think we continue to look at it. I mean, our position's been, we're not going to spend significant money until we're comfortable we have the predictable regulatory environment that gives us the assurance for the project. And that's â I think we've been very consistent on that message. So what we have in there is still some money that ties to some pre-FEED work. How much of that we'll spend this year probably depends on how quickly they find their solution.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then just lastly, as it relates to the production guidance, I see that the U.S. onshore position is the primary contributor to the improved capital efficiency, but was just wondering on the international assets, does the update of full year guidance just reflect actual Q1 results? Or is there also, I guess, some upside baked in there now for an improved outlook for the rest of the year? Just thinking mainly about kind of any updated views you all have on Israel gas demand and West Africa downtime in particular. Thanks.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we honored the first quarter, obviously, and the read through on that is that we added some for Israel expectation with this mandate now for pushing more from coal to gas. Could there be some more? I hope so, but we'll wait to see. As Keith highlighted, on an average basis for the full year, we have ability to absorb some more upside if they continue to push more of their power generation to gas. But we've built in some of that.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks.

And we'll go to our next question from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on a couple of earlier questions. First, on the Delaware Basin wells that you highlighted on slide seven, both that had strong rates versus your type curve, if we look at the relative performance of each, the Calamity Jane outperformed on a lateral length adjusted basis, seemingly a lot more from gas and NGLs relative to oil. And I wondered if you could talk about the geology as it moves from east to west within your acreage block, and if we should expect a differentiation in well productivity and in production mix.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, I think on the Calamity Jane, the gas percentage, what we see from our mapping, as you move probably further north and maybe a little east of the Calamity Jane location, we think it does get a little gassier, and we think we've tapped into some of that with this well. I think as you move back to the west where, by far, the majority of our acreage is, we would expect to see the higher oil cuts more in line with what we're seeing in Soapy Smith.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. And so the decline profile is going to look similar on both wells or is there any other differentiation that you see?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Well, I think, we â Brian, we consider it all Tier 1 acreage. But even within Tier 1, there's obviously some acreages better than others, and I think generally speaking, we see the eastern half of the acreage, Tier 1 acreage, slightly higher quality. I think you're seeing that in the performance of the wells. Most of the activity that we have planned for the rest of the year is in either the central or eastern half of the acreage block, so we'll continue to test that theory as we go.
I think the interesting thing about the Soapy Smith is even though it's outperforming the type curve â not as much as the Calamity Jane is, but it's outperforming the type curve, it's significantly outperforming, I think, some of the historical wells in that area by as much as 20% or 30%. And so that's the well we did the slickwater test on. It's really the only well that we've done a slickwater test on in that area. I think that potentially could create some excitement going forward as we test more slickwater in the Delaware Basin and see how much uplift we can get from that versus the historical hybrids.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thanks. And then going back to the asset sale, you've gotten a couple questions here on you thinking about using proceeds towards debt pay down or balance sheet improvement and recommitting capital to drilling. But wondered on the M&A front, how you're thinking about and what ability there may be to further add to your Permian and Eagle Ford positions, and whether the asset sale opens up the flexibility in your mind to do so?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, it just gives us more firepower, if you will, Brian, for that type of thing. And there's no doubt we'll continue to look at opportunities in those areas, especially up around the Delaware and so forth, and obviously, a number of others are doing the same thing. So it would have to be the right opportunity, the right situation, and it's going be based off the asset and inventory quality that we'd be looking at. But we'll continue to look. This doesn't really change how much or what we're looking at, but it just gives you more in reserve to use. And that's one of the three legs of opportunity that this can be used for. We talked about the balance sheet, we talked about accelerating the activity when that makes sense, and the third piece of that is continuing to build opportunity for the future.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And I guess given the point that you made on â that it is a competitive environment, you're not the only one looking to expand in the Delaware, do you think it is realistic that something that could meet your needs from an accretive acreage perspective and financial objectives could come available here this year?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think we'll see some things we'd be interested in. We'll just have to see if we can find the opportunity to make the right deal at the right price. So I mean what this â we have a big inventory, I mean, as I've talked about before. Our Delaware Basin position plus our Eagle Ford position is pretty much the same thing as our Wells Ranch and East Pony position. So both of those give you a large inventory, but we'll continue to look at what new opportunities will be there and make sure we're in the market so we can understand what a good opportunity looks like.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.

And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Good morning, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Dave, I wonder if I could go back to the cost question in the DJ. The other thing that kind of jumps out to us is that obviously, you completed about a third of the wells than you did a year ago. So I'm wondering if that new â the cost level, your obviously pretty impressive reductions year-over-year, would be sustainable as you â if and when you had to ramp activity back up again. In other words, is it structural or something just related to high grading?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, Doug. This is Gary. I mean, I don't think that's a huge driver. I think it's true, if you got less activity going on, you can have more people focus on it and perhaps be a bit more efficient. I think you also have a tradeoff, though. When you have less activity going on, you just have less scale and less ability to be more efficient that way. So I don't see it being a huge driver one way or the other.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Yeah, thanks for the answer. Dave, on the acreage, the sale, obviously, a pretty good number given you had nothing going on there. There was also a â there seems still to be a fairly large footprint outside of your two core areas. What are your thoughts on further paring down that position in the DJ given your current activity levels?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Right. I think I'd go back to my earlier statement. As long as we feel we can create more value out of it than somebody else, we'll continue to keep looking at the optionality of that acreage. I mean, I think when you look at even outside of Wells Ranch and East Pony, it's very valuable acreage, and I think this deal highlights that. So no rush to do anything different.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
How would you characterize the â any interest â any ongoing interest levels? Or was that the only thing that was on the table currently?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think this was the one that has the most interest. It was the one that made sense discussing. But I don't think there's anything else that's at that stage right now.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And last one from me, if I may, is the MLP sector has obviously had something of a rebound since the lows a couple months ago when you deferred the timing of IPO on the Midstream. So, I'm wondering if your appetite is changing any, given the â and I realize commodity's still pretty weak, but at least the sector has had a bit of a bounce. What are your thoughts on timing? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
Kenneth M. Fisher - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, this is Ken, Doug. I think we've continued to monitor that very closely. The sector has bounced a bit since February, but I think you ought to see continued â a little improvement before that would be imminent.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch

Okay. And we'll take our final question from John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Yeah, hi. Thanks. You've mentioned monobore drilling for the DJ. I was wondering if you're doing it or planning to do it in Texas at all.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Hey, John, it's Gary. Yeah, we haven't really progressed that in the Texas area yet. I think that will be one thing that we certainly look at as we increase the activity especially in the Delaware and start to move more of it to a development mode there.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. Last one. You had about 173 DUCs all in onshore U.S. at the end of the quarter. How quickly will you consume them throughout the year?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
I think we've talked in the past about we'll work off some of that DUC total through the year in the Marcellus where the completions are kind of loaded towards first half of the year. Certainly, in the DJ, with only running two rigs this year, we'll work that down a bit this year. I think when you look at the Texas assets, a certainly point forward. We've got roughly as many wells planned to be drilled as we do to have â bring online, so that will be fairly flat from this point forward. (57:32-57:40)
