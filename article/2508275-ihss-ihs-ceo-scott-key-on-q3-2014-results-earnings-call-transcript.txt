Good day to you, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. Welcome to your Quarter Three 2014 HIS Inc Earnings Conference Call, which is hosted today by your Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Eric Boyer. My name is Casey, and I am your event coordinator during your call today. During the call, your lines are on listen-only (Operator Instructions) I would also like to advise all participants this call is being recorded for replay purposes.
Now, I would like to hand it over to Mr. Boyer. Please go ahead.
Eric Boyer
Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the IHS Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our third quarter earnings release earlier this morning. If you do not have a copy of this release it is available on our website at IHS.com.
Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and other items.
Our earnings release includes both, our GAAP-based income statement and statement of cash flows and reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules are included in our release and can also be found on our website.
The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or in part without the prior written consent of IHS is prohibited.
Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from the expectations can be found in IHS's filings with the SEC and on the IHS website.
After our prepared remarks, Scott Key, IHS President and CEO and Todd Hyatt, EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will be available to take your questions.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott Key. Scott?
Scott Key
Thank you, Eric. Welcome to everyone, and thanks for joining us. We look forward to discussing our Q3 results today and providing an update on the good progress we are making on the key initiatives that are allowing us to achieve the long-term goals we have outlined in terms of scaling IHS, expanding organic growth and margin and building strong free cash flows and earnings.
Todd will provide specifics on our financial performance for the quarter in a few moments, but I wanted to start with an overview of where we are, and a few comments on Q3 and progress going forward.
Overall, we were pleased with our Q3 performance, delivering results in line with our expectations for the period and we see the remainder of the year developing largely as expected with solid underlying organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and earnings for 2014, then building into 2015 as we have outlined over the last year.
We had revenues of $556 million in Q3, up 16% from 2013. We maintained our subscription organic growth in the period delivering 6%, importantly; we see the right development of sales pipelines and the execution of account and product initiatives that will lead to planned organic expansion in the quarters ahead.
We also delivered non-subscription organic growth of 1% in the period normalizing for the Q3 2013 biennial Boiler Pressure Vessel Code product. Although Q3 is our second lowest revenue quarter annually, the result for the period was solid subscription organic performance and continued positive non-subscription performance.
Adjusted EBITDA was $174 million for the quarter, up $31 million from Q3 2013. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.4% expanded 140 basis points year-over-year and in line with the expectations we set for the quarter and reflecting the strong incremental margin conversion to profit as we continue to expand our organic performance and realize benefits from acquired assets and our common global infrastructure. This strong EBITDA performance drove solid free cash flow, with $459 million for the first nine months of the year, which is an increase of 65% from the year-ago period. Todd will spend some time on this in a moment, but great cash generation in Q3.
As we committed to you, our strong free cash flow has allowed us to quickly de-lever following our Q3 2013 acquisition of R.L. Polk, reaching our target leverage ratio in less than a year and enabled us to re-enter the M&A market in Q3, as we closed two small but strategically important acquisitions.
In terms of our regional performance, in the Americas, we delivered solid organic subscription revenue growth as we continued to fully align our sales teams to our core industry verticals and focused on cross-sell of integrated solutions on the new platforms we are bringing to market. We will continue this process through Q4 as we plan for 2015 and these efforts are an important part of expanding organic performance in the coming quarters.
In EMEA, our organic growth trend continues to benefit from the completion of the alignment of sales teams, leaders and systems to our core industry verticals, the critical nature of our offerings and our low market and customer penetration in the region, despite some large economic uncertainty in the region. Finally, in APAC, performance continued to improve as expected based on strength in subscription and improving non-subscription organic growth as we grow presence in market penetration for existing products and services through the solid APAC infrastructure we have put in place over the last few years.
Let's shift now to our core industries and horizontal platforms that are driving our commercial expansion initiatives. Resources, which include our energy and chemicals teams experienced stable growth across the portfolio, benefiting from the rollout of IHS Connect in both, energy and chemicals this year as we expand usage and build full year sales pipelines.
Across our industrials teams, which include automotive, technology, maritime and aerospace and defense, we see improving trends as evidenced by the positive sequential organic growth improvement of 5% in industrials from Q2. Remember, that the rollout of our common global infrastructure and back office systems and processes through 2012, allowed us to more fully organize around customers by industry and each region and globally. Across industrials, we are now beginning to see the full benefit of this, as well as the strong leadership and teams that are singularly focused on increased market penetration to expand organic growth.
Our Q3 organic performance in autos was strong as we benefited from the new products and synergy revenues realized from the 2013 R.L. Polk acquisition. In technology and maritime, we see the improving growth trends we discussed in Q2, delivering good gains in sales and product pipelines.
Finally, in aerospace and defense, we see the same trends over the past couple of quarters, with emerging strength in the period in EMEA and APAC, and signs of improved organic performance in the Americas, that is being marginally offset by continued pressure from the U.S. government spend reductions.
Our horizontal products had good underlying organic subscription performance, while non-subscription and reported organic growth was impacted in Q3 by BPVC comparisons.
The underlying trends remain positive aided by product investment and the delivery of new platforms and capabilities into the market in operational excellence and risk management, economics and country risk, as well as product design and our engineering offerings.
In the period, we completed the acquisition of Global Trade Information and PCI Acrylonitrile, our first acquisitions in over a year. Global Trade is not financially significant to 2014 performance, but very strategically important as it allows us to expand our maritime and trade leadership globally, with unique capabilities.
Global Trade is the global leader in helping customers make more informed strategic, policy and trading decisions by better understanding the flow of goods at a product level. PCI Acrylonitrile is also not financially material, but is a strategic provider of chemical market insight that deepens and strengthens IHS chemical global market coverage in the commodity and engineering plastics and fibers sectors, which is important to the very connected supply chains we support.
During Q3, R.L. Polk delivered significant value as a result of successful integration that created a scaled IHS automotive capability and this is part of the positive industrials sequential organic expansion and margin expansion in the quarter.
As we closed the first nine months of 2014, we made good progress on each of our other 2013 acquisitions, but we also had several quarters of further work to fully realize planned revenue synergies and to drive to accretive organic growth and margin performance.
As a reminder, we completed seven acquisitions in 2013, including our largest, R.L. Polk, and five in our resources vertical. Our integration and synergy capture path with acquisitions for both, revenue and expense is typically six to eight quarters as we have discussed previously.
We have passed the Q2 one-year anniversary for all of these assets except Polk, which fully lapped in mid-July and now have each reflected in our organic performance as we continue to reach integration milestones over the next few quarters. Specifically, a couple of the assets we acquired in 2013, had capability overlaps to some existing IHS offerings. This required certain product eliminations this year, which negatively impacted growth in Q3 and will again in Q4.
We are continuing to build to planned revenue synergies and new product introductions as we fully achieve our goals for these acquisitions in 2015. As we have outlined for you, every IHS leader and colleague has two clear priorities linked to our performance, operational excellence and commercial expansion.
Operational excellence is our relentless focus on continuous improvement in internal systems and processes to make us more efficient every day and allow us to capture new growth and expand margins as we fully leverage our global infrastructure. Our progress is reflected in strong margin expansion in the quarter and we expect to deliver solid expansion in Q4 and beyond in line with our clear commitments.
Turning to our commercial expansion efforts, which include our workflow platform and account growth initiatives, we made good progress in the period. Our workflow platform development and rollout allows us to become further embedded in our customers' key decision processes and daily workflows across our core industries.
Beyond giving customers a common point of access to integrated IHS solutions, they also simplify the selling motion and enable our substantial cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. In addition, these platform rollouts support our account growth in our Target 1000 accounts, field sales and inside sales.
Let me provide just a few highlights of our progress in Q3. We successfully delivered planned commercial releases on IHS Connect, adding new content for energy customers and adding enhancements to our economics and country risk solutions. We continued to drive growth in overall usage on Connect, which was up 30% over Q2.
We completed three product releases of the engineering workbench and passed significant content milestones. We were also awarded a U.S. patent on our underlying Goldfire semantic search technology surpassed 50 customers live in production and grew users by 400% in our Knowledge Collections product through the first nine months of 2014.
We completed further development and planned releases of our energy platforms, HIS Meridian/Navigate, and our new analytical offering; Vantage is scheduled for commercial delivery at the end of 2014.
Our operational excellence and risk management enterprise platform, IHS Sphera, continues to experience good customer reception and adoption. We also made good progress in the period on each of our account growth initiatives, where Target 1000 subscription pipelines for existing customers and potential new customers had increased by double digits year-to-date.
As a result, we remain on track across these initiatives in terms of market release of new products and platforms, account engagement and to build and close sales and new sales pipelines as we head into Q4. Importantly, this forms the basis of future organic revenue growth expansion. As a result, we remain on track to our multi-quarter growth expectations.
Before I hand over to Todd, I want to take a moment to discuss the strength of the performance culture we have built over many years at HIS, that is grounded in responsiveness to customers and the engagement and success of colleagues. This culture is the foundation of the recognition of IHS for a second year in a row by the inclusion in the Dow Jones North American Sustainability Index that was announced just last week.
This achievement is a reflection of not only the strength of our performance-based culture and business model, but the long-term sustainability of our performance and potential. I congratulate every IHS colleague and leader on this important recognition.
In summary, we had a solid third quarter and first nine months our 2014 fiscal year, with a steady build in new sales and sales pipelines, progress with new product development and market release of new platforms that will lead to building organic growth. We achieved many of our acquisition goals and realized further efficiencies from our common global infrastructure and processes that created strong profitability and solid free cash flow generation.
Our business model strengths and consistent execution have allowed us to continue to de-lever from our largest acquisition as we expand margins, as well as acquire strategically important capability that ensures future growth. As a result, we anticipate the year to close largely as expected and have the foundation for further performance improvement as we enter 2015.
With that, I will turn the call over to Todd.
Todd Hyatt
Thank you, Scott. Let's start by reviewing some of the financial highlights for the third quarter. Revenue was $556 million, an increase of 16%. Adjusted EBITDA was $174 million, an increase of 21%. Adjusted EPS was $1.49, an increase of 17%. Free cash flow was $135 million, an increase of 124%.
Relative to revenue, Q3 was a solid quarter with stable subscription and non-subscription growth. Note that we lapped the Polk acquisition in mid-July, so Polk is included in acquisitive revenue in the first half of the quarter and organic revenue for the second half of the quarter. Because of this and the strong prior year performance, Polk organic revenue growth contribution in the quarter was limited. As Scott indicated, all other 2013 acquisitions are also reflected in organic performance for Q3 and going forward.
In the quarter, revenue increased $76 million to $556 million. Revenue included organic growth of 5% adjusting for the biennial BPVC product which benefited 2013.
On a reported basis, organic growth was 3%. Growth from acquisitions contributed 11% and FX had minimal impact. We saw stable subscription revenue with 6% organic growth. Third quarter subscription was a strong 78% of total revenue. Our non-subscription organic revenue was up 1% year-over-year, normalizing for the BPVC product.
On a reported basis, non-subscription organic growth was negative 5%. For the remainder of my comments, we have normalized organic growth rates for the prior year impact of the BPVC product to provide a more meaningful understanding of the underlying business performance.
As we have previously indicated, in Q3 2013, BPVC had a positive $7 million to $8 million revenue impact on our non-subscription organic growth, primarily in our Americas region. The revenue tables in our press release have not been normalized for BPVC and include reported organic growth rates for your reference.
Looking at regional performance, Americas overall reported revenue increased 18%, organic growth was 3%, acquisitions added 17%, due to R.L. Polk's significant U.S. presence and FX was a minimal adverse impact. Americas' organic subscription revenue growth was 5%, and non-subscription organic growth was minus 2%.
EMEA's overall reported revenue growth was 13%, organic growth was 8%, acquisitions added 2% and FX added 4%. EMEA's organic subscription revenue growth was 8% and non-subscription organic growth was 8%. The very positive EMEA performance is reflective of solid infrastructure, improved sales systems and processes and strong sales leadership and field sales teams.
APAC overall revenue growth was 7%, organic growth was 6%, acquisitions added 2% and FX had a minimal positive impact. APAC's organic subscription revenue growth was 6% and non-subscription organic growth was 6%.
Across the regions, Americas continues to anchor our organic subscription revenue growth with very stable performance and we continue to see strong underlying growth rates and trajectory in EMEA and APAC.
Let me also comment on our product categories, which Scott provided color on in his opening comments. Our organic revenue growth in Q3 included resources of 6%, industrials of 6% and horizontal growth of 2% as normalized.
Turning now to profits and margins, adjusted EBITDA totaled $174 million, up $31 million or 21% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.4%, which represented a margin expansion of 140 basis points versus the prior year and nearly 175 basis points removing the drag from FX in the period.
Margin performance was due to the realization of operating efficiencies and improved margins of acquired entities. We expect to see similar margin expansion again in Q4 as we continue to benefit from the leverage in our business and integration of acquired assets.
Regarding segment profitability, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $134 million. EMEA's adjusted EBITDA of $41 million, increased sharply over last year with a 56% improvement. APAC's adjusted EBITDA improved $3 million or 30% year-over-year. I was pleased to see continued positive EBITDA improvement in EMEA and APAC, which benefited from revenue growth on the scaled infrastructure we have deployed globally over the last three years.
Turning to adjusted EPS, Q3 increased to $1.49 per diluted share, a $0.22 or 17% improvement over the prior year, reflecting the strong accretive benefit of the R.L. Polk acquisition, as well as operational improvement. Depreciation expense increased sequentially in Q3 and we expect to see additional increased depreciation in Q4.
Stock-based comp was $128 million for the first nine months and we continue to trend below the low end of our guidance range for the year as we have effectively managed our burn rate to the 2% of outstanding shares we discussed on our January call. Our year-to-date GAAP effective tax rate was 23%, and is trending slightly above the high end of our guidance range of 20% to 22%.
Our adjusted tax rate was 29% and continues to trend toward the high end of our guidance range of 28% to 30%.
Turning to free cash flow, during the period we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a 124% year-on-year increase. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was a strong $586 million and represented a conversion rate of approximately 87%. This very high conversion was driven in part by significant improvement in our cash collections and working capital position that are benefiting from our operational excellence focus.
We are very pleased with this conversion and the continued strong cash generation attributes of our business model, which provides this great operational and capital structure flexibility. Given strength in the first nine months, we expect free cash flow conversion to outperform our full year mid-60s conversion target, but also expect lower conversion in Q4. Longer term, we expect a mid-60s conversion, reflecting in increased interest expense and an increase in our cash taxes.
Turning to the balance sheet, our quarter ending debt balance was $1.9 billion and our cash balance was $262 million. Our quarter-end gross leverage was 2.8 times, which is in line with the target leverage range we discussed at Investor Day. We are pleased with the rapid de-levering from our elevated 3.7 times leverage at the close of the Polk transaction in July 2013.
Turning to guidance, we are updating our annual guidance to raise our revenue range, tighten our adjusted EBITDA range while keeping the same midpoint and to raise our adjusted EPS outlook.
Our revenue guidance range is now $2.225 billion to $2.235 billion, which includes full-year reported subscription organic revenue growth of 6%. Relative to Q4, recall that in the prior year, we reported revenue catch-up from several large energy past dues, that drove 1% of additional subscription growth. This will create difficult year-over-year comparisons in our reported Q4 subscription growth rate and more specifically within our reported EMEA, APAC and resources growth rates.
Normalizing for these past dues, the underlying Q4 subscription organic growth rate is expected to be approximately 7%. We continue to see reported non-subscription to be neutral-to-positive for the year in line with our full year guidance. Our Q4 non-subscription growth rate will be negatively impacted by strong one-time sales within our resources industry in the year ago quarter.
Note that our year-to-date reported non-subs growth is 0% and our non-subs growth normalized for BPVC is 2%. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $685 million to $695 million which is consistent with the middle of our guidance range commentary we provided in June. We expect to see solid margin improvement, well above 100 basis points in Q4 and we expect full year adjusted EPS of $5.70 to $5.80.
In regards to the impact of recent M&A activity, the two small acquisitions closed in Q3 are not financially significant to 2014 results. We would categorize the purchase multiple paid for the combined acquisitions to be strategic. As a result of synergies and tax strategies employed, the cash flow and underlying MPV of the acquired assets are more in line with our typical acquisition profile.
In summary, we reported solid organic revenue growth for the first nine months of the year and we are also pleased with our year-to-date profit performance and strong cash delivery. While we continue to invest in the business and our future growth, we also expect to see improving margins once again in Q4.
With that, I will turn the call back to Scott.
Scott Key
Thanks, Todd. I want to thank my IHS colleagues for their tremendous focus in the first nine months of the year. A couple of closing comments, then let's get to your questions.
As we have indicated, we continue to see the right progress in new platform releases, new product introductions and sales and account growth initiatives that are building our sales performance and pipelines. Our disciplined and consistent execution is translating efficiencies from our global infrastructure into strong profitability, free cash flow generation and expansion in margins.
I want to share one more item before we wrap up, we are focused on fully leveraging our global infrastructure on new platforms to better align to customers and this is our greatest opportunity to fully realize our long-term growth potential. As part of this continued evolution, I'm pleased to announce that Jonathan Gear will take on an expanded role leading all IHS industry verticals.
Jonathan brings great experience to this role, in resources leadership and in building our industrials verticals teams including very successfully building IHS automotive and integrating the largest acquisition in our history, Polk, over the last year.
Anurag Gupta will continue his large operational role in leading IHS corporate development and M&A, IHS product development and technology as well as our global information operations and IHS strategy and commercial initiatives and horizontal products business lines. In each of these areas, we have made great progress as we build our organic potential and elevate our growth.
Finally, Sean Menke, who has led our resources core indices, will be leaving IHS to return to the aviation industry. I want to thank Sean for his contributions to the success of IHS and personally wish him the best of luck.
In closing, we like our position as our year-to-date performance has us on track to our annual and three-year commitments. We see a positive path forward as we continue to scale IHS with the right assets that are substantially accretive to shareholders.
Todd and I are ready to answer your questions, so let's start the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you speakers and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mr. Paul Ginocchio and the gentleman's from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Scott Key
Hi Paul.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank
Great. Thanks. Just two questions, first, it looks like obviously your revenue is slightly better, but you didn't change your EBITDA line. Is there some kind of additional investing you are doing in the fourth quarter that we should know about? Second, you called out some product eliminations. I hadn't heard of that. How much was that of an impact in the third quarter? Thanks.
Scott Key
Yes. Thanks, Paul. You know, we really feel great about the margin expansion. 140 basis points, and if you take the FX headwind off, almost 175 basis points and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter, so we feel great about margins.
As we said, we continue to invest to drive growth and are seeing the right things from those investments in our initiatives, so I feel good about that as we end the year and start next year. On the product elimination side, we were also focused on Polk last year, you may not realize, we made seven acquisitions in total. As I said, five of them in resources, so we are about four quarters in.
On occasion, we will acquire something that has some overlap to HIS. Not everything is fully complementary, but we always have great long-term accretive growth and accretive margins for every acquisition.
 
We are about four quarters in. Two of those assets had some overlap and we eliminated those now and we are now starting to see the negative revenue comparison about 50 BPS for Q3 and Q4. Then the other thing I would say, Paul, is a lot of things going on here, but we are trying to be pretty straightforward about the underlying performance of the business. Actually, if you take those eliminations and exclude them, we had good improvement in organic growth from Q2. As we said, if we look at Q4, the underlying business has got 7% subs. We are building just as we expect, so we feel pretty good about where we are.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank
Okay. If I could get a follow-up in, obviously, your field sales, I think, is most developed in Europe and you are seeing or you're just a reorganization of your sales force is most developed in Europe. You are seeing great growth there. It's more developed in Asia. Again, you are seeing better growth there than U.S. and it is least developed in the US.
Can we glean from the recent results or the trends that, as you put field sales into the U.S. we should see improvement there or is there something else going on in the U.S.? Thanks.
Scott Key
You got it. That's exactly it. We had good progress this year. Great leadership here in the Americas' sales and good realignment and it is the (Inaudible) region, so a little slower to happen, but that's great performance. Also, we got some U.S.-only things. Those eliminations primarily impact the U.S. As I talked about these couple of assets that we are integrating and then we talked about a little bit of slowdown in government spend in the US, but fundamentally you're right exactly right. Thanks so much, Paul.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank
Thanks.
Operator
 
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from Mr. William Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.
William Warmington - Wells Fargo
Good morning, everyone.
Scott Key
Hey, Bill.
Todd Hyatt
Hi, Bill.
William Warmington - Wells Fargo
A question for you on the margins, you had talked about in the past about how the operating leverage really kicks in as you accelerate above the current level towards sort of the 8% to 9%. Also, I wanted to ask if you could talk a little about possibly some of the cost cutting opportunities that you have as you transition people over to the IHS Connect platforms.
 
Scott Key
Thanks, Bill. We have talked about a number of things with regard to those transitions, so obviously the leverage in the model that we are seeing it now and we are back delivering to the consistent margin expansion we committed to and really positive here in the back half of the year and into next year.
That's really broad-based both, our acquisitions coming up to the margins we expect that are accretive, leverage of our global systems. As you said, as we transform the new platforms, we talked about 1,300 software engineers and developers in IHS; 70% to 80% of them we talked about in the past working on legacy systems and platforms, so there's a real opportunity as we transition to these new platforms to shut down legacy things, which we have done on Connect and those are part of that story, so broad-based, though, Bill and great opportunities going forward and we are seeing that develop in the business right now. Thanks.
 
William Warmington - Wells Fargo
How soon do the cost cuts on the support for the legacy systems start to flow through?
 
Scott Key
The rollouts are over the next six quarters or more and so we are about four quarters, five quarters in, so that is just continuous. Also realize, we are going to be smart about transitioning some of those resources onto new analytical tools. Things like Vantage, so we are going to balance the eliminations to meet our commitments of 100 basis points at a minimum of margin expansion every year but also put that expense into new growth so we also meet our commitments to the 100 to 150 basis points of top-line expansion every year. Thanks, Bill.
William Warmington - Wells Fargo
Got it. One more question if I might. I was hoping for an update on how CARFAX is performing and on any other new products that you were thinking about such as the used car listings?
Scott Key
Great. You know, Polk in general with CARFAX strong growth last year in CARFAX were lapping strong growth to strong growth, so doing well. [10] of basis points addition to overall IHS organic growth. Probably less than half of what we saw in industrial expansion of 5%, so just good continued strong performance. Thanks, Bill.
 
William Warmington - Wells Fargo
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Mr. Manav Patnaik and that gentleman is from Barclays. Go ahead please, sir.
Unidentified Analyst

Hi. This is actually Ryan filling in for Manav who is traveling today, so just a couple of quick questions on some of the subscription organic. I think last quarter you had mentioned improvements in America and we kind of see that, obviously, holding steady. I was just wondering if we should expect to see an inflection point or any commentary around the America performance.
Scott Key
What we said is we have great confidence in the underlying build of our organic growth in the business, so we are seeing all the right things in our platform (Inaudible) our account growth initiatives and in terms of the transformation of sales and alignment with customers. We are seeing the right things in the underlying performance of the business. We would all love to see this translate into earned revenue faster than it likely will, but it's a slow, steady build. Subscription based business, a slow, steady build, we are trying to give you a real transparency into the underlying performance of our organic levers that we see developing exactly as we expected and then we see that translate quarter-by-quarter steadily into the organic earned revenue performance that report, so no inflections, a steady build, we are right where we want to be and moving forward. Thanks so much.
Unidentified Analyst

Great. Just one more if I could, you have mentioned kind of a return to M&A. Obviously, two deals recently, is there anything you are particularly looking for? Is it going to be a lot of these kind of tuck-in strategic to kind of build out a product portfolio and what are you seeing in terms of pricing in the environment?
 
Scott Key
Well, great opportunity to continue to scale across those businesses and verticals that we are at a lesser scale than we would like to be, so a maritime and trade, focused their technology, further automotive and aerospace and defense. Typical deals as you know, $30 million in revenue. We pay kind of $100 million, two to three times or so-ish, so that's what we are looking at, great pipeline and the right things happening there and watching our leverage.
There is a lot more enthusiasm as IHS has shown a great path of value creation for shareholders for our information and subscription-based assets. I would say there is some enthusiasm in the market for assets, but I would tell you that everything we are doing right now almost 100% of it is outside of an auction, so maybe expectations are a little higher, but it is within our control and we are managing that well.
Unidentified Analyst

Thanks.
 
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Mr. Peter Appert, and the gentleman is from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, sir.
 
Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray
Thanks. Scott, I am not sure I understand exactly what you said on Polk, so in terms of the momentum in that business is how important is Polk in terms of incremental organic growth in the fourth quarter?
Scott Key
Thanks, Peter. CARFAX, let's separate the two. The Polk division and CARFAX, so as you know CARFAX, is a very strong organic grower. When it came into IHS, it remains a strong organic grower, so it is lapping on strong organic growth and still doing great, so it's not really an incremental provider of organic expansion, but it's a great foundation of organic performance.
Six new products, IHS automotive, collaboratively released between Polk, which is now fully integrated into IHS automotive and as you know it was a low-single-digit grower and we had IHS automotive at a high single-digit growth rate, so we are seeing expansion in growth and positive improvement there.
 
You know, really impressive, 5% sequential improvement in organic growth in industrials. As I have said, less than half of that we can attribute to Polk, and [10s] of basis points on IHS overall attributed to Polk in aggregate, so I hope that helps understand it.
Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray
That is helpful. Then one follow-up. This might be for Todd, but if I've done the arithmetic right, I think your fourth quarter EPS guidance at the mid-point of the range would imply about $1.51, which would be bit of a slowdown in terms of the year-to-year growth rate. Is there something you would call out that would be impacting the flow through to EPS or tax issue or something?
Todd Hyatt
Well, I talked on the call, Peter, of outlook about a tax rate that we expect to be a bit elevated above the existing guidance, so that certainly will be a bit of an impact. I also talked about depreciation expense, expected to be up sequentially. Then, I think, when we look at Q4, in Q4 we were benefiting from Polk as we go through the first three quarters. Obviously, we have now completely lapped that acquisition, so I think those are the primary factors. I think, Todd, we also talk about our activity acquisitively and then the grid on our loan right, so we had interest expense tick down a little bit. As we get back into the market we may see it tick back up.

Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray
I got it. Did the impact of higher depreciation and higher tax rate, would that flow through then into fiscal '15 as well?
Scott Key
We have talked about a tax rate that tick up about 1 point over the next couple of years, so 22% on the GAAP tax rate is what we guided to. This year, we have talked about it. As I've said, slightly above that, so expect that to continue to be the case in 2015 as well. Certainly with depreciation expense, we invested in building out platforms and portfolios, so I think you can look at the capital spending and see the depreciation will continue to move up sequentially.
Peter Appert - Piper Jaffray
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
Scott Key
Thanks Peter.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Mr. Gary Bisbee, and the gentleman is from RBC.
 
Scott Key
Hey, Gary.
Gary Bisbee - RBC
If I could dig a little more into the strong sales execution in EMEA, you have talked about aligning the sales force along the industry verticals, but can you give us a little more explanation what really does that mean and what is the time line to complete that in the Americas segment?
Scott Key
Yes. Thanks. It is a great question. We are a relentless integrator and half of our growth has been through acquisitions over the last 10 years, Gary, so we acquire customers and really the whole Target 1000 and our industry alignment is about the opportunity to ensure we are talking to the right customers, not just those customers we acquired.
What we found is, we don't have enough of our sales specialists talking to our highest opportunity accounts which is our 1,000 most high-potential customers in our core industries. Many of our sales specialists, for example, in the horizontals, like economics, country risk, operational excellence, risk management, our product design, many of them are deployed across other industries and talking to customers outside are highest opportunity accounts. Again, that is a result of those sales teams that joined us over the years.
Now that we have the benefit of great sales systems and visibility into our customers, what it allows us to do is realign those sales specialists and our field sales teams to having the most high-potential conversations with our most high-potential customers in our core industries, so that is what we are talking about, is shifting who they are talking to and the size of the opportunity they are going after. That really has been, again, this path of an integrated solution in all of our largest customers in our core verticals.
APAC and EMEA being smaller organizations, but of course we are seeing great growth. It's been an easier and faster path in making that transformation. America is being about 60% and the largest portion of our sales force a little slower in that transition, so that's really what's going on. Then we are using the benefit of these new systems, really starting in Q2 or so of 2012 and into 2013 to allow us to drive this transformation. 
That's our long-term growth catalyst. Hope that's helpful, Gary.
Gary Bisbee - RBC
Thanks. Then just one follow-up, I think you made the comment the Target 1000 pipeline year-to-date was up double digits. What exactly does it take by your definition to be put in pipeline? Is that a verbal from the customer saying we will buy it, but you haven't processed it or it is more you schedule a meeting and what exactly does that mean? Thank you.
Scott Key
Well, that's a great question. Our new systems allow us to have a very disciplined multi-stage risking of opportunity from first opportunity all the way through closed sales, 100% probability of closed and closed sales.
What we are talking about is high probability, not the total pipeline, but high probability to closure, we track, of course, the total size, but then again, multistage process and the probabilities get tighter and tighter or closer and closer to 100% and zero risk as we get to close sales, so it's those things that we see as high potential to close and generating revenue in the coming quarters. Thanks so much, Gary.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Suzi Stein. The lady is from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Suzi Stein - Morgan Stanley
Hi. European organic subscription growth looks pretty strong relative to other parts of the business. Could you maybe talk a little more about what you are seeing there in particular? For instance, what are you seeing in terms of increasing penetration also just where is the sales force gaining traction?
Scott Key
Yes. Thanks Suzi. As we were just talking about, great alignment to the highest opportunities, then you touched on it, so we are very underpenetrated globally, probably the most underpenetrated in APAC, but 30% underpenetrated on average. When we get real alignment of the sales force, having the right conversations with the most high opportunity core industry accounts, we just start to see greater momentum. I would also say that we have got a much better sense of where performance is because of our new sales systems, so we can on a daily basis look at the performance of every sales executive, every sales VP, their territories, so we have very tight performance monitoring.
Then because of those systems, we know how to focus those teams on our highest opportunity accounts. It really is this shift where we actually are even more underpenetrated in our core accounts - core industries than we were outside of them.
So I think that's discipline, tight execution, pointing resources at highest opportunities. Then we have brought the right skills on to get to closed sales effectively, so a lot of high performers and we will see that happen across the company. Thanks Suzi.
Suzi Stein - Morgan Stanley
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Mr. Joseph Foresi from Janney. Please go ahead.
Joseph Foresi - Janney

Hi. I just wanted to drill down on two different questions here. First, where were the product eliminations this quarter? Why now? Then how did that impact the present quarterly growth? I think there's some more coming next quarter. What should we look at on that front?
Scott Key
Sure. When we acquire a company, we talk about six to eight quarter path to realize the synergies both, in revenue and in expense and margin. Of course, we don't buy anything that doesn't have high single-digit organic growth potential and can't be accretive to IHS's organic growth or accretive to IHS's margins. Capturing that is a six to eight-quarter process, so we start very quickly.
Polk is a great example, largest acquisition where we have gotten most of those in the first four to five quarters, but still have a few quarters to go. On occasion, we will acquire a company that has an overlap in terms of its capability and its products and its revenues. It's usually pretty minimal, but what happens is two or three quarters in, we start combining products and eliminating those products where the overlap was.
If you imagine, two closed last year, by Q1, Q2 of this year, we started eliminating and combining products, so we had revenues from those acquired assets this time last year, Q3 and Q4, started eliminating those duplicative products and building new synergies in Q1 and Q2. There's no new eliminations, we are done with all that work and now we are building, we've got new products out in market, but we are lapsing those revenues from last Q3 and Q4 right now, elimination's all done, all that work behind us, new products out in market, we are just lapsing those revenues that existed last year in overlap that we now have eliminated with customers and we are now building our organic growth.
It's as simple as that about 50 BPS impact in Q3 and Q4. The only reason we call it out is, we are just trying to have you have a clear sense of the underlying momentum in our organic growth and subscription base, which is exactly on track to what we expect. Thanks so much, Joe.
Joseph Foresi - Janney
That's helpful. If I could just sneak one more in, I think you talked about the difference in the U.S. and EMEA. If we were to put a percentage on it, what part of that is sales focus versus the markets themselves? Thanks.
Todd Hyatt
Well, I think we all know that GDP growth in the U.S. is probably the strongest of anywhere in the developed world, so we really have great fundamentals here in the Americas and probably more uncertainty in Europe.
Now uncertainty is usually beneficial to IHS because we help people sort through it, so I think overall market, we have got great potential and in both markets we are underpenetrated. I think it's this alignment around our sales teams. Of course, the U.S. impacted by these eliminations and U.S. government constraints, but I would say it's the sales force process we are going through is a good part of that and we are going to see it build in coming quarters. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from Mr. Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman
Thanks. Good morning. First, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the metrics behind exactly where you stand on the rollouts of the various content aggregation platforms. I know you have mentioned some progress you made on the Sphera and the Engineering Workbench, but I know at the Analyst Day you specifically called out around 35% or so of the $1.3 billion of subscription revenue had been rolled out at that point. I don't know if you have a similar metric of where you stand today?
Scott Key
Yes. I would say it's incrementally above that. We are another quarter-and-a-half in since Investor Day, so we talked about a 12-quarter process. You know, I would say right now probably 70%, 80% of the development complete, that's maybe marginally up from what we talked about last quarter. Then it's just about getting content on and rolling out. We still have, Andre, another six quarters or so to go, Connect maybe a little longer than that to get across every industry, so we are less than 50%. We are making good progress, a bunch of releases.
More importantly on the energy side, Vantage, Navigate, Meridian, these things all start to launch commercially into Q4 and as we enter 2015, so just about getting all of those out into the market, so 100% out as we get into the start of the year. Hope that's helpful, Andre.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman
Yes. It is. On the same topic, I was wondering if you could speak to the average level of up-sell or increased purchasing activity for the customers that are placed on the platforms when you roll them out. I am wondering when they do decide to buy more, what the pattern of that is? Do they tend to buy more right away or is it after they have been on the platform for a little while. What are you seeing in terms of both, the pattern and the general level of increased activity once you put them on?
Scott Key
Well, that's part of the steady build. It is driven by the renewal cycle, so we have the new opportunity on the platform. We then create bundles that really demonstrate to the uplift potential and those bundles are designed around where the uplift has greatest opportunity. We then align sales to it and incent them for it.
Then when we get to the renewal, we have had the conversation with the customer and they are ready to purchase. Once that renewal closes, we see it developed into earned revenue on a ratable basis, You know, so those renewals are spread through the year and that is why this is a steady build. 
Even though it is out there on the platform, let's say, in January like we were in energy and started to be in chemicals, the renewals happened all year, so the uplift really happens slowly and steadily. Then we see it translate into earned revenue, so that is the process. Thanks, Andre.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman
Thanks.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.
Scott Key
Hi, Shlomo.
 
Operator
We appear to have lost the gentleman. Hopefully, he'll dial back in. We will go to the next question from Mr. Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust
Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott Key
Great to have you.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust
Scott, it sounds like you are executing very nicely against the plan, especially on Connect and perhaps Vantage is a nice driver for you next year. A couple questions, one, could you talk a little bit about the sales cycle?
I know you mentioned the pipeline and it sounds like it is robust and it sounds like Americas is a great opportunity as you roll out the sales force, but are sales cycles sort of longer, shorter, about the same as we have gone through the year here? Anything changing on that front? Then I have one follow-up.
Scott Key
Sure. Well, across our business we have a range of sales cycles, right? Sales cycles for our forecast and analytics tools probably tend to be the shortest. As we get down to operational excellence risk management, those sales cycles in the enterprise systems where we're really helping people improve their performance and reduce their risk are much longer, almost a year or maybe even more. We do have a mixture, but probably you are asking how is the market changing.
I would say sales cycles are getting back to more normal ones in EMEA. A year ago they were lengthened, authorities were raised higher, so I think we are getting back and even in the Americas to a more typical sales cycle length that we might have seen a couple to three years ago, but nothing material. I think we are executing well. I think cycles are not getting longer. If anything, on the shorter cycle things maybe getting shorter and we are seeing that benefit in EMEA for sure and elsewhere.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust
Okay, so that might be one of the things that, obviously, that could help provide an organic revenue growth tailwind.
Scott Key
Yes.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust
With regard to Polk, the outlook for a little better subscription organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, is that 1% uptick is it all Polk? Can you get any more granular in terms of what is driving that?
Scott Key
Sure. As Todd said, it is actually mostly in resources. A year ago, we had a lot of subscription catch-ups in Q4 in resources in EMEA and in APAC. Then, we on the subscription side - so that is the 1%. If you remember a year ago, we said we reported a 7. We said it's actually a 6 and it was, because we just got the benefit.
We were trying to be very transparent as how we started the year, so we gave 6% to 7% subs growth guidance for this year. We started the year at the 6% on the reported basis. What we are saying is the underlying performance of the business as we adjust for that, particularly in resources in EMEA and APAC, has the subs base roughly at 7, so we are kind of exiting where we had hoped to be on an underlying business performance basis and it is really the foundation of next year so that's where it is coming from.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust
Okay. Thank you.
Scott Key
You got it. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you for your question. We have Mr. Rosenbaum back with us from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.
Scott Key
Hey, Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel
Hi. I am sorry. I am not sure what happened there. I just wanted to dig in just a little bit, the non-subscription revenue. You guys have been doing a good job kind of moving it back up. It looks like the growth excluding the Boiler Code thing was low-single-digits. Can you just give us a sense as to what is moving around between the different areas you had software and services, consulting, transaction events and other? I know it is kind of bumpy, but where were you showing improvements and where there is still room for improvement in the next several quarters?
Scott Key
Well, the improvement is pretty broad-based, so I would say consultant is doing well across the business. The lumpiness is on some of the software, so you will see that lumpy up and down. We had a really strong non-subs Q4 a year ago, particularly in resources, so that is kind of some of that lumpy nature.
We will see what happens as we get year-end close, so I think it is pretty broad-based. Our goal was to have this neutral to positive and really we have done that all year long, we are happy if it lifts a little bit above that. Of course, we are at the highest percentage of subscription of our revenue that we have probably been in, Todd, three, four, five years as we are edging up towards 80%, so we feel pretty good about that.
At low-single-digit on the non-subs as long as we stay there, it is not going to drag the overall organic growth rate and subs will be the driver, but also these are really important things to be doing with our core customers and we have got some great consultants and teams that are doing the right stuff out there to help customers succeed and leverage our core offerings.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel
Okay.
Scott Key
Anything to add to that, Todd?
Todd Hyatt
No. Perfect.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel
Just in general, different times you have referenced that you had a certain organic growth rate and it felt like it is moving higher or more stable or a 6% felt like a 7%, 7% felt like a 6%. You have 6% subscription organic growth, sequentially quarter-over-quarter, underlying for things that we don't necessarily see in the numbers right now, does it seem like the up-trend continued through the quarter or was it more stable with where you had last quarter?
Scott Key
 
Yes. I appreciate you asking. We are just trying to be transparent, so we had a 6% in Q2 on the subs. I talked about 50 BPS around these product eliminations that just became organic from 2013 acquisitions. We normally would not call that stuff out, but we just want to be really transparent on how the business is. That means, it is better than 6%, right?
 
Sequentially 6% lifted better than 6% on the underlying business. Then we are saying 7% in the underlying business in Q4, so that's just a nice steady build. It's exactly what we expect and we are seeing the right momentum in the business and our initiatives, so thanks for asking because that is exactly why we are trying to give you that transparency.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel
Okay. Thank you very much.
Scott Key
Appreciate it.

Thank you for your question. Your next question comes in from Mr. Anj Singh from Credit Suisse.
Anj Singh - Credit Suisse
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to focus in on the investments that you spoke about earlier on the call. I am wondering if there is any particular areas that you can parse out of focus in Q4? I know in the past you have talked about building the brand and the global Web presence as well as e-commerce. I am wondering if we can get an update on how those initiatives are faring.
Scott Key
Yes. For sure, so e-commerce, we continue to put products on the platform, translating from these 40 disparate systems to the single system and that's we have got measured in little less than $10 million out of the $70 million, $80 million that will be there eventually, but good performance on the platform and people using it. Just a nice experience, so e-commerce is building and we have got another year of transition of stuff onto it.
Not a lot of heavy investment in the brand, but in our web presence, so you are going to see in the fourth quarter a release of ihs.com that really brings a great new experience to customers and will be a great lead generation tool for us, so that is an investment that won't continue in 2015.
Primarily, you see it in our CapEx, all right, Todd?
Todd Hyatt
Yes.
Scott Key
About 50% of CapEx to product development platform and then we are going to continue that into the next year, so the right use of CapEx at kind of the 5% to 6% of revenue to build future growth.
Todd Hyatt
Yes. Then we will continue to balance the investment and the margin well, I think, which we have done. I think the other things I would call out, I mean, Vantage, we see opportunity with Vantage. We have talked in the past about CARFAX and the used car listing. I mean, those are areas where we are mindfully investing in the future growth.
Anj Singh - Credit Suisse
Okay. Great.
Scott Key
Thanks so much.

Thank you for your question. Your last and final question comes in from Mr. Nick Nikitas and he is from Robert Baird.
Scott Key
Hi, Nick.
Nick Nikitas - Robert Baird
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just circling back to the organic subs growth, I know you mentioned the underlying 7% growth rate for Q4, but just looking at a headline number, could we maybe see a deceleration in the subs growth given the tougher comp and acquisition product overlap you mentioned or would you expect that to be kind of stable around the 6% number?
Scott Key
Yes. Sure I do and that is why we said we will on a reported basis in the guidance update, obviously, improving the revenue outlook as we have talked about and EPS. Then in subs reported at 6%, what we are trying to tell you the underlying. That's within the range of guidance on a reported basis that we gave for the year, but the underlying we are seeing the right improvement that has us building, right, through the whole year, actually which has been exactly what we wanted to see.
Nick Nikitas - Robert Baird
Okay. Great. Just one quick one for me, As you lap Polk, can you talk about just the current margin versus the mid-20s when you first acquired the company now, how traction is going in regard to that?
Scott Key
Yes. Todd, do you want to jump on that one?
Todd Hyatt
Well, I mean, we talked at the beginning of the year about it 200-basis point to 250-basis point margin improvement in Polk. Certainly, as we deliver to the margin in the back half of the year and very strong margin expansion, we are driving to the level that we had spoke about coming into the year. We fully expect to exit the year with Polk moving very near the IHS-like margin level.
Scott Key
Yes, so a great progress and it is the benefit of the largest scale acquisitions with more mature systems, Todd, I think as you had talked about that really allows us to achieve those synergy goals probably faster than the smaller ones that we are seeing, so a great progress in one year. Great credit to our teams and a lot of fun to see the success, thanks so much.
 
Nick Nikitas - Robert Baird
