David Garofalo
Thanks, Lynette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the third quarter, we saw lower all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold sold, reflecting the company's focus on cost efficiencies as well as the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. This was partly offset by planned lower sales volumes and production due to lower grades at Penasquito and the exhaustion of surface stockpiles at Cerro Negro and Eleonore. With a solid third quarter underpinned by better results from our flagship Penasquito mine, we are very comfortable in reiterating our full-year guidance range of between 2.8 million and 3.1 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of between $850 and $925 per ounce.
We also announced today an inaugural gold mineral resource of 5.4 million ounces at Porcupine's new Dome Century project. A concept study for a potential new large-scale open pit operation is underway, which could dramatically increase the gold production profile from this camp. The concept study is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 and, after that, we will proceed to a pre-feasibility study. We liken this in scale, grade, and prospectivity to Canadian Malartic and Detour, but in a camp that has been well-established for over 100 years. Dome Century supplements an already robust project pipeline.
During the third quarter we committed $1 billion to growth as expansions commenced at Penasquito and Musselwhite and the Coffee project acquisition was completed. The pyrite leach project at Penasquito and the materials handling project at Musselwhite are expected to contribute gold production growth and lower unit operating costs by 2019, while first gold production at the Coffee project is targeted for the end of 2020. After the completion of an optimization study at our Porcupine camp, we have now identified over 60% of our targeted $250 million in annual sustainable efficiencies by 2018.
Turning to the third quarter results, cost efficiencies and the strengthening U.S. dollar drove all-in sustaining costs down to $812 per ounce compared to $858 per ounce in 2015. The same factors impacting production and all-in sustaining costs resulted in adjusted cash flows from operations of $341 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $506 million in 2015. During the quarter, we repaid $226 million in debt. $56 million was used to fund the growth pipeline, and $14 million was paid in dividends.
Net earnings for the quarter were $59 million or $0.07 per share and included approximately $0.04 per share of restructuring costs and non-cash deferred taxes unrelated to the performance of the underlying business. This compares to a net loss of $192 million or $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to the key operations, as we shared in the second quarter conference call, Penasquito was back up to normal operating levels for the quarter. Mining also moved into higher-grade ore at the bottom of the pit, resulting in an improved quarter for production and costs when compared to the second quarter of this year.
Though an illegal blockade late in the third quarter resulted in a short controlled shutdown of operations on October 3rd, we do not anticipate that production for the fourth quarter will be materially impacted. Our throughput for the fourth quarter is expected to be between 100,000 tonnes and 110,000 tonnes per day with a continued improvement in gold rates between 0.85 grams per tonne and 0.90 grams per tonne.
In October, we achieved full design capacity at the Northern Well Field and delivered the project under budget. We expect this will provide sufficient water supply for the life of mine of Penasquito.
At Cerro Negro, due to disruptions from a substantial and necessary restructuring that resulted in a significant workforce reduction and the prior-year exhaustion of ore surface stockpiles, production for the third quarter was lower than the comparable quarter in 2015. We anticipate consistently achieving mill nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day in 2018 as we advance the pre-feasibility study for mining of additional veins at the Marianas Complex scheduled for completion by the end of this year.
Eleonore delivered another solid quarter. The team continued to improve the stope designs as they increased their understanding of the ore body. We also commissioned the production shaft, which will drive down costs and deliver operational efficiencies. The completion of the loading pocket on the bottom of the shaft by year end will provide the platform for deepening underground development. The exploration shaft is now being de-commissioned and will only be used for ventilation going forward. We remain on track to achieve nameplate capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day of ore throughput in the first half of 2018.
At Red Lake, production increased compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to increased throughput and higher grades. New mining fronts and improved mining efficiencies, from both mining in the Upper Red Lake and sulphide zones were key enablers to the increased production. Engineering continued to advance on the rationalization of the shaft and mill infrastructure. During the third quarter, the number one shaft was placed on care and maintenance. Plans are in place to shut down the Red Lake mill in the first quarter of 2017 and place Campbell shaft on care and maintenance in the second quarter of 2017.
At Porcupine, production decreased compared to the third quarter of 2015 as a result of lower mine tonnes from the Hoyle Pond and Dome mines, offset by higher mined tonnes from the Hollinger Open Pit. The excitement surrounding the Porcupine camp this quarter was on the inaugural resource of the Dome Century project, which Paul will discuss shortly.
Musselwhite continued to be a consistent performer during the quarter with solid production and low operating costs. During the quarter, we progressed towards our $250 million target of annual sustainable efficiencies by 2018. Porcupine identified $35 million of cost savings. This adds to the cost savings identified in the second quarter of between $60 million and $70 million at Cerro Negro and $50 million to $60 million at corporate. This optimization process is currently underway at Penasquito, where we expect to unlock between $50 million to $60 million. In 2017, the process will begin at Red Lake and Eleonore. We are well positioned to meet our target of $250 million if not exceed it.
As our sustainable efficiencies will drive increasing net asset value, so will an increased focus on exploration. I am pleased to be joined by Paul Harbidge, our new SVP, Exploration. Paul brings a new perspective on the exploration potential surrounding our camps.
Paul Harbidge
Thanks, Dave. I'm very excited to be part of this team, to manage our target of increasing reserves and resources. A number of our land packages are underexplored and I am working with the site teams to focus their exploration program to maximize the value from our exploration dollars. The strategy that I have laid out is two-fold. Firstly, reserve replacement through the conversion of resources and extending known mineralization at the mine sites. Secondly, development of a pipeline of targets, which will deliver opportunities for future discoveries.
The exploration business will be managed using the resource triangle, by applying both rigorous geological and stringent economic filters to rank and prioritize targets, which will then either be advanced or rejected, while generative work ensures a constant supply of new targets. Primarily, the focus will be on brownfields exploration and the leverage of the exploration potential within our mining camps to increase the operations' net asset value through new discoveries. The triangle shows our current status of 169 targets in our portfolio. You will note that we have a very well-balanced portfolio in Canada, but work is needed, especially in Mexico, to build the base of the triangle with a portfolio of targets, while generative work in Argentina is required to provide a constant supply of new targets as we embark on our exploration programs at Cerro Negro.
Turning to our reserves, we saw a 4% increase to 42.3 million ounces primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Coffee project. As a reminder, we changed our cutoff date to June the 30 from December the 31 in order to align our life-of-mine planning process with current reserves and resources. This meant a drill cutoff date in late April and, compounded with seasonal lower drilling in December and January, led to less exploration data than usual for the resource and reserve update. We maintain high quality economic ounces as shown in the unchanged reserve grade of just over a gram. This was a reflection of our focus on margins and net asset value maximization over ounce maximization.
Approximately 1.1 million proven and probable gold mineral reserves were added due to exploration drilling. However, this was offset by resource modeling changes primarily at Los Filos and Eleonore. The positive addition of 1 million ounces resulted from changing gold price from $1,100 in 2015 to $1,200 per ounce in 2016.
Moving on to Dome Open Pit. Following a complete review of the Porcupine operation as the Dome underground mine approached closure, a new geological model was developed resulting in an inaugural resource of 5.4 million ounces at the Dome Open Pit. These resources have been calculated using expected mining dilution and, at this stage, strip ratio assumptions are conservative at around six-to-one. These resources form the basis for a concept study that is underway to test the potential of a new large-scale open pit mine. We have 10 years of base case data to analyze from the previous open pit operation and we expect to complete the study in the first quarter of 2017 and then proceed to a pre-feasibility study.
With the opportunity to extend the Dome Open Pit, new infrastructure will be required as the current mill, processing plant, and administration building sit on top of what is planned to be the extended open pit. With a large land package, we will be able to leverage the new infrastructure to drive efficiencies, which will potentially open up more opportunities district-wide.
One of those opportunities is our Borden project, which is approximately 160 kilometers east of Porcupine. At June 30, probable gold mineral reserve increased 13% to close to 1 million ounces. The increase was a result of in-fill drilling and engineering optimization. Exploration work at Borden, while continuing to confirm the geological model of the deposit, is also drill testing the hinge zone of a regional fold as well as the on-strike trend of the deposit to the northwest.
We are also embarking on a generative study, which will include the collection of field data, sampling, as well as the interpretation of geophysical and geological data to populate the base of the triangle with a portfolio of targets for future evaluation. At Eleonore, proven and probable gold reserves decreased to 4.57 million ounces compared to 5.35 million ounces at the end of December primarily due to depletion and reserve ounces from 2015 being reclassified into resources.
During the year, efforts were focused on increasing drill density and optimizing the mine plan and stope design. Additional information has allowed Eleonore to design smaller, higher grade stopes although faster sequencing and additional ore development will be required. The updated mine plan is expected to result in lower dilution and higher-grade feed and increase annual production compared to the previous reserve mine plan, increasing net asset value. Further drilling and mine design updates will concentrate on converting the resources back into reserves.
As one of our newest camps with a large underexplored land package, there is significant potential to expand the reserves and resources. Exploration has historically been focused on extensions of the known mineralization, which has now been traced to a vertical depth of 1,500 meters below the surface and is still open down plunge. While we will continue to focus on deepening the ore body, we will also be exploring from surface with three priority targets already identified in Old Camp, Mayappo, and East targets. The information from the these targets is currently being reviewed and reinterpreted to provide a field program for 2017.
At Cerro Negro, provable and probable gold reserves increased 4% to 4.85 million ounces as a result of resource conversion through exploration and a higher gold price assumption partially offset by depletion and more conservative operating cost assumptions. Comprising 215 square kilometers, Cerro Negro is another large underexplored land package with significant potential for resource growth. And with the political situation improving, we will commence an aggressive exploration program.
To date, we have a portfolio of 32 exploration targets. Silica Cap will be the priority target for scout drill testing. This target has a surface exploration of just over a kilometer and is thought to represent a strong silica alteration zone at the top of a mineralized epithermal vein structure. At Red Lake, proven and probable gold mineral reserves decreased 10% to just over two million ounces. The decline was a result of mining depletion partially offset by the higher gold price assumption.
Red Lake camp is a world class belt where we hold the dominant land package and have a significant opportunity to put our exploration dollars to work. While we have two projects advancing, in Cochenour and HG Young, we are also going to undertake a district scale study over the entire Red Lake belt by integrating all of the known data sets to provide a pipeline of targets for future testing.
At Penasquito, proven and probable reserves declined slightly to just over 10 million ounces. The decrease was principally due to model depletion, largely offset by positive changes to the geological block-model and the higher assumed gold price. As the resource indicated at the beginning of the presentation, work is needed to generate a portfolio of targets in the Penasquito district. We have a large package surrounding the mine and we are currently working on a generative exercise to populate the base of that triangle.
Since the completion of the acquisition of the Coffee project in July, exploration has been focused on the evaluation of early-stage targets to develop a pipeline of future growth opportunities. Scout RC and diamond drilling are underway on seven targets which have well-defined gold in soil anomalies. Encouraging results have so far been returned from Arabica, Kona, and Espresso, supporting the potential for additional oxide material.
We are also completing diamond drill holes at Latte to collect samples from metallurgical test work on the sulphide mineralization with objective of identifying a process path, which would support further exploration of the sulphide potential at Coffee. In conclusion, I am very pleased with the number of exciting exploration opportunities throughout the portfolio that leave us well-positioned for gold reserve growth in the years ahead.
David Garofalo
With that, operator, we can take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Barnes with TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Greg Barnes
Yes, thank you. I didn't think I would be first. I thought Andrew Quail would be. First off, are you a little bit disappointed with the reserve updates? You increased the grade - oh, sorry. You increased the gold price and you didn't get apparently much bang for your buck there. Was this a result of just half a year of drilling? Or was there a change in approach that was taken in this reserve calculation?
George Burns
This is George. I'd say there are two major issues here. First, definitely a change in approach. We're focused on net asset value. And so, with the increasing gold price, we were wanting to - we are ensuring that anything added is adding value and not just necessarily adding marginal reserves. And as the second key factor is we really - is a six-month update of which the first two months of that six-month update had less than normal drilling due to the winter conditions at many of our assets. So I'd say, no, we're not disappointed. It was a good result for a six month update. And I think Paul did a good job of describing our optimism about the growth potential on exploration going forward.
Greg Barnes
Do you think if you had had an additional six months, then, of drilling that this would have been materially different?
George Burns
Definitely the next six months we'll see better results than the six months we reported on.
Greg Barnes
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Butler with GMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Steve Butler
Good afternoon, guys. A question, David, on the rationalization or efficiencies that you attained in Porcupine. I know you've gone through some downsizing there. So is it really labor-related? Or I guess just maybe elaborate more on those efficiencies attained there. Thanks.
David Garofalo
Steve, the question is for Porcupine?
Steve Butler
Yes, on the efficiencies attained.
David Garofalo
Yes. So, we've invested significant money to install capital at Hoyle Pond, the core asset at Porcupine gold mines. And so that one [ph] is operational. The big focus on efficiencies are driving our current production rate from about 1,000 tonnes a day up towards 1,300 tonnes per day. And so those high-margin ounces would increase and create significant increase in value at Porcupine.
Now that's the core value in the improvements that we've noted in this release. Obviously, across the portfolio, G&A, milling, and our Hollinger open pit all have opportunities for improvement that we're focused on. But the bulk of the value will come out of Hoyle Pond.
Steve Butler
Okay. Now, it's still, I guess, early in the process in terms of it showing the benefits of the efficiencies attained in Cerro Negro, but obviously work stoppages were probably, I should say, a backlash associated with that. So maybe, how does it look on a go-forward basis? You're still getting some interruptions, it sounds like. Or when are the workers happy to go back to work?
George Burns
So Steve, this restructuring is a difficult process to go through, but it has a substantial impact on net asset value and it was the right decision to move forward with it. Where we're at now, we've accomplished roughly two-thirds of the improvements and reductions. We do have a massive training exercise in place. One of the big shifts, we've moved largely to a local workforce that's lower-cost due to the transportation issues. We have eliminated most of the expats that had been involved with the early days.
So we are working our way through ramping up the skill levels of our local workforce. We're confident about the future. And, again, the net asset value improvement from this restructuring is massive for this business unit. But the exploration potential we see at this property, obviously having lower cost is important to value.
Steve Butler
So is it further automation and further train that can get the same amount of workers to do the same amount of tonnes per day?
George Burns
Yes. Efficiencies in productivity, leveraging automation, is a big focus. Our Mariana Norte development is ongoing. It will have more automation than the Eureka and Marianas Central. So that is an important part of the story going forward. Another key aspect of this is simply the infrastructure and G&A costs.
For an example, you're aware we had two camps, one out at Eureka and one up at the mill. Through this restructuring, we're down to one camp. We have a local provider for camp services and we've had a massive reduction in our G&A costs. And those benefits go across every part of the business including sustaining capital projects.
Steve Butler
Okay. Thanks, George. Sorry, last one, I promise. Paul, on the indicated resource, are you suggesting that there's implicitly an internal dilution at least applied to that 1.07 grams per tonne on Century?
Paul Harbidge
Yes. So when we calculated the resources, we've included the internal dilution. So we're not expecting to see that grade drop as we go forward.
George Burns
Steve, I'd also add that, recognize we had an open pit that was mined for 12 years. In our modeling we're reconciling well against that historic pit. So we've got a great deal of confidence.
Steve Butler
Okay. And what was the internal dilution, approximately?
George Burns
I don't know that number off the top of my head, but it's a normal open pit dilution number.
Steve Butler
Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Haughton with CIBC. Please go ahead.
David Haughton
Yes. Hi, Dave and team. Thank you for the update and good to see some exploration being featured here for a change. And on that topic, just looking at the Dome Century and the development prospects here, are you thinking of this as a standalone operation? Or would it be more of a satellite feed, albeit with some of its own milling facilities, a satellite for Porcupine? How are you thinking about this?
George Burns
It's George. I'd view it as the cornerstone of Porcupine moving forward. So we're envisioning a new mill, much higher throughput; probably three or four times the throughput we have now on our existing mill, which is about 11,000 tonne a day, 12,000 tonne a day. And, obviously, Hoyle Pond and Borden are going to be key components to Porcupine business units, but we're viewing this large open pit opportunity as a cornerstone.
David Haughton
Okay. So, we should be thinking of Porcupine, then, as a large processing hub with a number of ore sources yet to be developed; for instance, Borden, Dome Century, together with the existing Hollinger?
George Burns
That's correct.
David Haughton
Okay, and then, on the exploration front, interesting to see the pyramid that was displayed there and the generation that you're looking for targets in Argentina. Is that just around Cerro Negro and the property that you have surrounding that mine? Or are you looking somewhat broader within the country now that things seem to have been liberalized as far as it being a destination where you can operate?
Paul Harbidge
First and foremost, it's about - thanks, unlocking the true exploration potential of Cerro Negro. We've got all of that infrastructure and capital spent on that project. So we want to maximize the net asset value of it by exploring. It's underexplored. It's over 200 square kilometers. We've got a multiple-vein surface. And a rig has just arrived on site to start at Silica Cap. We've got a whole pipeline of targets. That being said, we'd certainly look at other opportunities, I would say, proximal to Cero Negro with that infrastructure. But anything that meets Goldcorp standards, then we would look at it.
David Haughton
Okay.
David Garofalo
I think, more broadly, David, we have significantly more comfort with the macroeconomic model in Argentina. And if we could leverage our expertise there, our workforce there, to look at other opportunities, we certainly will. It certainly seems like a country that's much more open for business. But I think, more importantly, it's allowed us to drive down our cost structure quite dramatically within our existing business. The restructuring that we're undertaking right now, while painful in the short term, would have been impossible under the previous regime.
So the business climate generally is far, far superior to what it was previously. So we can bring our labor productivity levels up to, hopefully, over time, up to North American standards. And that's part of our broader theme in Argentina. There is labor unrest across the country because the government is making some difficult decisions to bring their labor productivity up. And I would say what we're doing at Cerro Negro is a microcosm of what's happening more broadly in the country.
David Haughton
Okay. So for a destination to reinvest your free cash flow, you're feeling a lot more comfortable with investing in Argentina going forward?
David Garofalo
Yes. In fact, we were dis-incentivized to do exploration drilling in the past because there was a tax on reserves. And that's been removed. And so, we're very comfortable cycling capital back into the country to optimize our existing business and look at other opportunities over time.
David Haughton
All right. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Kaip with BMO. Please go ahead.
Andrew Kaip
Good morning and/or afternoon. David, I've just got a couple of questions for Paul, actually. You've got a new set of eyes and you're looking at a large group of attractive land with exploration potential, and it's interesting that Dome Century is one of the new things that popped out. I suspect it's been in the works for a while. But Paul, are there other opportunities that you see, that are low-hanging fruit from an exploration standpoint that you think you can elevate quickly?
Paul Harbidge
I don't know about quickly, but I certainly believe there's a lot of opportunity in our existing camps. There's very much been a sort of tunnel-vision approach up until now. So it's a matter of pulling everybody back out of the detail. We've got a lot of historical old data that needs to be put together. And you see across the board in Canada in these old mature mining camps that there's a number of companies are putting that old data together, which previously wasn't digitally captured, and there wasn't the computing power in which to utilize this data. And they're coming up with some significant targets.
And we are certainly in the right address. We're in some of the world's best and most prolific mining camps, whether it's Red Lake, Porcupine, up in Quebec. And so one of the focuses I'm putting into place is for us to digitally capture, put all the data layered together and then deliver a whole - hopefully, a lot of opportunities. And hopefully some of those are going to drop out pretty quickly.
Andrew Kaip
Okay. And then, just on the Porcupine camp, there's a lot of potential infrastructure that needs to be reestablished and you're looking at larger throughput. So the capital to move this forward is going to be fairly healthy. And I'm just wondering whether you need more critical mass in that camp still to be making those decisions. And do you have other targets? Or does the potential relationship with your neighbor factor into this whole discussion?
George Burns
So this is George. The first comment I'd make is that when you look at our opportunity in the Century project, it correlates well with the early days of Detour and Malartic opportunities. Grades are similar. Throughput, as we're envisioning now, is a bit less. Recoveries are very similar. And we've got a little bit higher strip ratio than those projects. But it correlates well and we believe it's a big value-adder. In terms of our capability, we installed a Goldcorp investment framework here at Goldcorp the last couple of years.
Our first project's just completed under that new system and that's the Northern Well Field. That project came in under budget, about $13 million. It was $150 million project. And we have got the corporate capacity to support our site. With our decentralized business model, our mine general manager will own this opportunity, but we will be building a first-class construction engineering team to design this with innovation where it's applicable and we're confident we can deliver it.
Andrew Kaip
Right. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Tanya Jakusconek
Great. Good morning, gentlemen. I have a few questions. If I could start on the technical side with George. So actually, Dave, thanks a lot for providing the Q4 guidance for Penasquito. On Cerro Negro, George, we were looking I think on the last conference call to do about 2,800 tonnes per day in Q4, grading about 16 grams per tonne, 17 grams per tonne. Is that still the plan?
George Burns
So our production tonnage has not met targets due to these restructuring issues and interruptions in production. And I can't characterize it as we're completely out of the woods yet. There are remaining risks as we work through training and the restructuring. But I would say the results that we saw in Q3 are something that we can build up from. The interruptions over the last month or so, we've seen production as low as 1,000 tonnes a day. And, again, I expect to see us start ramping that back up to 2,000 tonne a day, 3,000 tonne a day range.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. Can I ask, at least in the month of October, have we been operating at normal capacity? Or have we had other down days?
George Burns
No, we've had about nine days that were impacted from restructuring and interruptions in production. And again, our production has been in that 1,000 tonne a day range during this tough period. But we're looking for that to begin to march back up towards the 2,000 tonne a day, 3,000 tonne a day mark for the remainder of the quarter.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. Has the grade, at leastâ¦
David Garofalo
Longer term. Yes, sorry. Tanya, longer term, the critical path is gettingâ¦
Tanya Jakusconek
The development.
David Garofalo
Marianas Norte deposit developed and incorporated for mine plan. Because, otherwise, we're ore-starved in the mill.
Tanya Jakusconek
Oh, yes.
David Garofalo
That's a bigger factor. And we're still on track with our underground development to get to that point by 2018, to 4,000 tonnes a day nameplate capacity.
Tanya Jakusconek
Yes. Yes, no. No, thank you. And I appreciate that. Has at least the grade been holding in the 17 grams per tonne, George, in October?
George Burns
Yes, the grade is consistent with that range, 15 gram to 17 gram per tonne.
Tanya Jakusconek
And maybe just going to Penasquito, how has the month of October - I think you mentioned that the grade was going to increase. And Dave gave us some guidance for Q4. What has throughput and grade been in October for Penasquito?
George Burns
So our throughput's back to normal levels; 100,000 tonne to 110,000 tonne a day. We had a nice kick-up in grade, as expected, in the month of September and that's continuing into October. And again we're comfortable we're going to have a solid fourth quarter.
Tanya Jakusconek
I saw the grade was 0.7 grams per tonne in Q3. So are we in the 0.8 grams per tonne in the month of October?
George Burns
Yes. The month of September actually was up close to 0.9 grams per tonne and that will continue through the quarter.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, maybe just coming on, if I could, to just Eleonore. And welcome, Paul. I don't know if you want to step in on some of these questions. I just wanted to ask about - obviously, we've had the movement of these reserves into resources. You tightened the drill spacing. Can you remind me where - because I think, George, when we were there last, we had talked about doing some tighter drilling. I think we had moved to 12.5 meters. Can you remind me what sort of drill spacing we'd have to tighten to and what mining dilution do we now have in the reserves for Eleonore?
George Burns
So drill spacing, we're in-fill drilling the 25 meter by 25 meter down to 12.5 meter by 12.5 meter. And as we do that we get a better understanding of the ore body. And in terms of dilution, the dilution, it's stope-by-stope dependent. It can be as low as 10% and as high as, say, 40% on more complicated orientations in the ore body.
Overall our dilution is built into the guidance or into the reserves that you see in our release. And the grade marginally went up about 0.2 gram per tonne in our reserve compared to the end of last year. So slight increase in average grade and that's again, baked into dilution numbers.
Tanya Jakusconek
Yes. I seem to remember - and again, going from memory - that the dilution in sort of the low 20s% in the previous reserves.
George Burns
On average that's the case.
Tanya Jakusconek
Yes.
George Burns
That's the best estimate, yes.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. And maybe just to clarify; I think our last guidance had been that for $100 move in the gold price, reserves would move about 2 million ounces and I noticed that that's not the case. It's about 1 million ounces. Is that the NPV approach that we've all of a sudden eliminated the 1 million ounces?
George Burns
Yes. We are ensuring that anything we bring into reserve has a reasonable margin, fits into our business plan as opposed to meets the technical definition of reserves.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. And do you know what the margin is? Do you have an internal rate of return that you need to beat? That's okay. We can take it offline. That's not a problem. Maybe if I could just ask one more question and then just leave it to someone else. Just on the new discovery in the Timmins District, we talked about having to move some infrastructure. So clearly we're going to need to permit this new area. Do we need to move the highway? I wasn't sure if that had to be moved at all.
George Burns
No, the expanded pit does take out the infrastructure including the Dome underground shaft, the old crushing facilities, admin building. But all this is on Goldcorp property. There's no need for moving highways or any of those other complicated issues. We're in a well-established camp, well-supported by the community. So we expect to get good support for the permitting requirements for this project.
Tanya Jakusconek
Okay. So it will have to be re-permitted?
George Burns
Yes.
Tanya Jakusconek
Yes. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Anita Soni
Good afternoon, guys. My question, I guess I'll follow up with the Eleonore topic. The reserve projections that you took at Eleonore from the engineering side of the equation, can you just let me know like at what depth of the mine that was taken out? Like at what levels and intervals. Yes.
George Burns
It's not really a specific elevation. It's where we in-fill drilled and found changes in the orientation of the mineralization. We basically look at the economics around development and extraction of the reserves and anything that didn't have a reasonable margin was pushed into resources for now.
Anita Soni
And that was done at varying depths of the mine or was that's just in the areas that you're currently focused on?
George Burns
It was in multiple areas in the deposit where we did in-fill drilling.
Anita Soni
All right. And then, my second question is going back to Cerro Negro and following up again on some of Tanya's questions. In terms of - I noticed the throughput that seemed to go down the most, came from the Marianas Central vein. Was there something that was going on that was specific in these labor disruptions to that specific side of the labor unrest? It went from 1,300 tonne per day down to 870 tonne per day.
George Burns
No. I mean, generally, the labor issues have involved the entire operation. So there's nothing different or significant there.
Anita Soni
All right. And then, I noticed in the commentary at Cerro Negro you guys mentioned that you saw that you would be able to sustain the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day in 2018. So does that mean that you expect by 2018 you should be at the full 4,000 tonne per day? Or at some point, perhaps, in the first half, second half or near the end of the year, you'd be at 4,000 tonne per day?
George Burns
Yes. At some point during the year, we'll be able to sustain that nameplate capacity on the plant.
Anita Soni
Okay. And, again, it's not really the plant; it's the mine that's ore-constrained, right?
George Burns
Yes. I mean the plant capacity is 4,000 tonne a day and our expectation is sometime during 2018 the underground will be able to sustain that mill capacity.
Anita Soni
Sure. And then -
George Burns
The key to this, Anita is the ramp up of Mariana Norte and getting through this restructuring, training with our workforce.
Anita Soni
Right. So how much, just as - I think from our last visit there, which was about a year-and-a-half ago now, I think our expectations were somewhere around 2,000 tonne per day from both the Marianas Central and Eureka. And then when was Mariana Norte supposed to come on stream and how much was that supposed to provide?
George Burns
So the 4,000 tonne a day in 2018 will have contributions from all three mines; Eureka, Mariana Norte, and Mariana Central. And in rough terms, I think you can look at it roughly a third each.
Anita Soni
Okay.
George Burns
You'll see Mariana Norte ramping up as it goes into production. You'll see Eureka tailing away. And then, as we stated, we've got engineering work underway on the Marianas complex. We've got several other veins that are being built into the life-of-mine plan.
Anita Soni
And I guess Marianas Central, you said at a third, by my rough calculation would probably will be somewhere around about four more years of that, then, I guess. Is that about right?
George Burns
Right.
Anita Soni
Considering how much you've - okay. And it's an average grade of about 16.5 gram per tonne, 17 gram per tonne, but you've been mining above that. Where do you think the grades will start to drop off for Marianas Central?
George Burns
Well the grade of Marianas Central will remain high. I mean the key is the distribution of that tonnage. And from my perspective, our focus on exploration and we're going to put a higher-value ounces in first. So we're looking for that exploration success. We've got the Emilia vein, which is an extension of Marianas Central that is higher grade. And, again, that's part of our development work that's ongoing right now.
Anita Soni
Sorry. Could you remind me, is the Emilia vein Mariana Central or Mariana Norte?
George Burns
It's a play-off of Marianas Central.
Anita Soni
Okay. And that does that require separate development work or you can just play off of it, as you said?
George Burns
I mean that this work we're doing on the whole complex is to sort out the development, to optimize the development of these veins.
Anita Soni
All right. And last question, I promise. Mariana Norte, the last known, I guess when you guys had given us, the last time you'd given us these grades by vein, I was looking at around 9.2 gram per tonne material. Is that still what you guys are seeing at Mariana Norte? Or is it higher at this point?
George Burns
That's about right. I don't have that number at the tip of my finger.
Anita Soni
All right.
George Burns
9, 10 grams, I recall.
Anita Soni
Okay. Thank you very much.
