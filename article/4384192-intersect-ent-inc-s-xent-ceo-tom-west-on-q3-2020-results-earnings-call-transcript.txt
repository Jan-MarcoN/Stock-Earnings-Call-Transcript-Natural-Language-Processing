Good morning. And welcome to the Intersect ENT Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After todayâs presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Intersect ENTâs Executive Vice President and CFO, Randy Meier. Please go ahead.
Randy Meier
Thank you, and welcome, everyone. And thank you for participating in todayâs call. Joining me today is Tom West, President and CEO of Intersect ENT.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law. Actual results and timing of the events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of those risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, our outlook for financial performance, sales force growth, clinical studies, approval of new products and indications and procurement of reimbursement codes and coverage, which are based upon our current estimates and assumptions, as well as other risk details from time-to-time in the reports, which we file with the SEC. We disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein.
Now Iâll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom West
Thanks, Randy. And thank you all for joining our third quarter 2020 earning call today. We had a strong recovery in revenue in the third quarter with many notable accomplishments, which reflect our efforts to enhance our commercial execution and improve our market access capabilities and infrastructure. These actions allowed us to benefit from the COVID-related procedure backlog in July and rebound in elected sinus procedures throughout the quarter, despite rising COVID case rates nationally and ongoing pandemic hotspots.
Our performance in the quarter saw revenue grow 132% sequentially versus Q2 2020 and track to nearly 95% of the revenue generated in Q3 of last year. We believe these results demonstrate our commitment to execution and our ability to return to growth.
Our revenue results reflect a rebound for PROPEL in July where we were able to address pent-up demand for FESS procedures, as many surgeries had been delayed in the early phase of the pandemic. In addition, use of PROPEL increased in office space procedures as physicians are using PROPEL more frequently in conjunction with office space balloon sinuplasty.
With SINUVA, we experienced increasing enrollments, improving conversion success rates and shorter times between benefit verification and actual procedures, leading to record SINUVA revenues in the quarter.
We also expanded our market presence by entering into an agreement with AllianceRx Walgreens Prime for the national specialty pharmacy distribution of SINUVA. This marks a significant opportunity in helping to expand the ability of SINUVA to be procured by ENT physicians and their patients behind Walgreens greater national coverage and strong payer relationships.
Taken together, the performance of PROPEL and SINUVA in the quarter gives us confidence in our ability to return to meaningful growth in 2021 relative to our pre-COVID performance in 2019.
In addition, in October, we closed the acquisition of Fiagon AG Medical Technologies. With this transaction, we have purposely and strategically expanded our portfolio of ENT product offerings and gained scale in key European markets, notably, Germany.
Fiagonâs existing and prospective product portfolio complements Intersectâs core of PROPEL and SINUVA sinus implants, accelerates our entry into the adjacent balloon sinuplasty market and leverages our existing physician relationships and commercial strengths.
Iâll now touch on each of these achievements in greater detail, starting with our third quarter performance. Following the dramatic downturn in sinus-related surgical procedures at the end of Q1 of this year, PROPEL rebounded nicely in the latter part of Q2 and throughout Q3.
PROPEL continues to gain momentum, as it recaptures a broader share of total FESS sinus procedures. We estimate that PROPEL is used in between 15% to 20% of total U.S. FESS procedures, leaving ample upside for growth in all settings of care.
Our current market development focus for PROPEL is on augmenting our health economic evidence of benefit to expand PROPEL specific payer coverage beyond the existing FESS procedure code. We have strong peer reviewed published data already supporting for instance, the substantial reduction in the need for expensive post-operative interventions.
We are seeking to add to that by utilizing the American Academy of Otolaryngologyâs registry database, soliciting the direct support of state and national societies and pursuing our own prospective registry and evidence trials.
In addition, PROPELâs Q3 performance was enhanced by separate reimbursement for PROPEL using our J code, J7401, which covers both PROPEL and SINUVA in the office setting of care. Physicians are becoming more aware of both PROPELâs clinical utility in the office particularly, post-sinuplasty and the available coverage specific to the implant.
As a result, we are seeing increased use of PROPEL in the office. PROPEL office use grew 62% in Q3 2020 versus Q3 2019. We think the move towards a greater number of office and ASC based procedures away from the hospital will continue and we are seeking to capitalize on that trend with our broader portfolio, enhanced clinical evidence and increasing implant specific payer coverage.
Our European sales of PROPEL also benefited from a rebound in sinus surgery procedures throughout the summer. However, the recent uptick in European COVID cases, this growth was offset by a slowdown in procedure volume in the last month of the quarter.
Turning to SINUVA, with our efforts and investment in the first half of the year beginning to show results, SINUVA had a record revenue quarter, driven by increasing physician awareness and comfort with reimbursement, improve conversion of identified patient candidates, as well as the growing physician adoption, and in some cases, preference for buy-and-bill procedure implant coverage.
In addition, SINUVA also benefits from the COVID accelerated shift of care from the hospital and ASC to the office setting, particularly as an offering that comes in lieu of revision surgery and a hospital visit.
Beyond the record results, we are tracking several encouraging metrics, which underscore our strong performance. Enrollments of prospective patients are up versus a year ago and are also up on a trailing three month basis. Conversion rates are improving significantly, while benefit rate verification time is shortening. This demonstrates that we are meaningfully reducing the sand in the gears that we have spoken of in the past with our market access programs and our SINUVA funnel.
With the two-fold improvement in enrollments and conversion rates at our hub and with our specialty distribution partners, SINUVA disbursements and actual procedures are both up at an even greater rate. Procedures in turn lead to replenishment in the channel with revenue shipments from us.
In Q3 we saw SINUVA revenue achieved $1.7 million, up 53% versus Q3 of 2019. Itâs our intention to share more of our funnel performance data and metrics in future calls, as we gain greater evidence of their predictive value.
Increased analytic rigor allows us to target and focus our clinical, selling and marketing efforts to build the market for SINUVA. These metrics highlight an accelerated level of position demand, giving us confidence that SINUVA can achieve significant future growth.
Even with this recent success, conservatively, we estimate that we have penetrated less than 5% of the total available U.S. market for SINUVA, an alternative to revision surgery for sufferers of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps.
There were two further highlights for SINUVA in the quarter. First, we went live in July with our C code, C9122 for pass-through coverage of SINUVA for Medicare patients when treated in an ambulatory surgical setting. Pass-through coverage is granted by CMS when they see a breakthrough procedure and want to ensure that the Medicare population has unencumbered access to the innovation. With the C code, we now have SINUVA specific coverage for nearly 80% of commercialized and over 90% of public lives in the United States.
A second highlight in the quarter was the partnership we announced with AllianceRX Walgreens Prime, a nationwide leader in specialty pharmacy distribution. This partnership will facilitate broader physician and patient access to SINUVA by using the expertise and establish nationwide reach of AllianceRX Walgreens Prime.
This will enable the patientâs medical and pharmacy insurance benefit to be realized. This efficient and scaled approach will further simplify product offering, fulfillment and treatment processes for ENT medical practices and their patients.
As we stated last quarter, our ongoing commercial actions to develop -- to further develop our market and infrastructure are yielding positive results. We are seeing an increase in physicians embracing buy-and-bill as our field based reimbursement team is excelling at educating physicians and their office staff on the benefits of buy-and-bill to the physician and to the payer.
Our C code expands coverage for Medicare patients. In addition to AllianceRx, we continue working with other leading specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors to create and expand opportunities to improve enrollments, conversion rates and buy-and-bill success, while delivering timely procedures.
Letâs turn now to our strategic acquisition of Fiagon. Fiagon is a German-based leader in electromagnetic surgical navigation solutions. Fiagon navigation systems and suite of surgical tools are targeted to the ENT surgical space.
Their proprietary, easy-to-use, accurate and integrated surgical navigation solutions support both routine and complex ENT procedures, enabling surgeons to track the full range of instruments deployed during a functional endoscopic sinus surgery procedure.
In August, Fiagon also received 510K clearance of its Vensure Balloon devices, new navigable and standalone sinuplasty balloons. The Vensure Balloons are sterile single use devices designed to remodel structures within the sinuses. The navigable balloon is designed for use in conjunction with the Fiagon navigation system.
Launch of the Vensure Balloons are planned for next year. Importantly, Fiagon enables us to accelerate our entry into the balloon sinuplasty market as we continue to develop and anticipate the launch of our unique drug coated balloon.
Moreover, Fiagonâs integration allows us the opportunity to offer a more comprehensive suite of solutions across the continuum of sinus care, inclusive of SINUVA, PROPEL, balloon sinuplasty and sinus surgery navigation.
Integration activities are now well underway as part of this process and I have asked Randy to lead these efforts. We began integrating prior to closing, which enabled us to hit the ground running upon closing on October 2nd.
While we are very focused on the near-term -- in the near term on U.S. commercial activities that will help ensure the successful introduction and transition of Fiagonâs installed base and existing customers over the next few quarters, we are also developing plans for expanding our European business as well.
The Fiagon acquisition is consistent with our goal of providing comprehensive, value-added and evidence-based solutions for ENT physicians and the patients they serve. We expect this business to be accretive to topline growth in the first year post-close, with meaningful revenues beginning in the middle of 2021 and integrating and accelerating commercial synergies with Fiagon, we believe that we will be well-positioned to formally launch our new navigation and consumable tools product portfolio, including the Vensure Balloon by the middle of the first half of 2021, thereby contributing to second half 2021 growth.
As we mentioned on the last quarterâs call, with the rebound in elective surgery procedures, we restarted manufacturing earlier than expected with our first post-shelter in-place production runs of PROPEL and SINUVA in July. With the expected increase in demand, we are aligning, manufacturing and supply chain activities to match the current environment.
While manufacturing remains below our pre-COVID capacity, we are continuing to ramp-up capacity and regained scale quickly. We expect that production will be back to full capacity before year end. With expanded demand and production, we expect to return to pre-COVID gross margin run rate in the low 70% range by year end for our core products of PROPEL and SINUVA.
Beyond our traditional production and manufacturing activities, the expertise we developed in conjunction with our own balloon design and manufacturing is enabling swifter collaboration with the Fiagon teams, as we begin to ramp production of the Vensure sinus balloons, as well as expanding capacity for other Fiagon products.
With regard to our R&D and clinical programs, as I mentioned earlier, weâve initiated in our planning on expanding follow-on health economic studies and clinical trials for PROPEL both inside and outside of the U.S.
We are integrating Fiagon into our product development activities, and reviewing and aligning our respective pipelines, which we anticipate will provide earlier access to global markets and enhance our ability to expand our overall product line.
Our objective, as weâve stated previously, is to provide a steady cadence of innovation to ensure our product lines remain compelling, clinically backed and top of mind among the physicians we serve, as we expand across the continuum of chronic rhinosinusitis care.
With respect to our drug coated balloon program, we continue to be in discussions with the FDA in developing an appropriate clinical trial design and PMA submission. As a result of COVID-19, some interactions with the FDA had been delayed, and at the same time, we remain cautious about initiating a pivotal trial with rising COVID cases.
Taken together, this may impact the timing of our PMA filing as our intended start of the drug coated balloon pivotal clinical trials was set for early 2021. With that in mind, we previously estimated a commercial launch of our drug coated balloons in late 2023. However, in light of recent COVID-related developments, our potential launch date may be pushed later by up to six months.
We remain committed to the drug coated balloon program and are exploring the means to compress our timelines. But we are also grateful for the near-term alternatives of the navigable conventional sinuplasty balloon Vensure from Fiagon.
To recap, we are pleased with the progress made in the quarter as we continue to scale our business to deliver predictable and sustained growth. Positive momentum from our PROPEL family of products and record quarterly revenues of SINUVA has us on the right track.
Also, expanding our commercial product portfolio and expanding our international footprint with Fiagon were other big steps in achieving our goals. Despite COVID, we are in a much stronger position today than we were a year ago.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, based on our surveys, there is appropriate industry caution about where broader and general electric procedures will net out in the coming months due to the uncertainties related to the resurgence of the COVID pandemic. The healthcare system is far better prepared to deal with rising COVID infection rates and to sustain the majority of elective surgical procedures.
Regardless of the risks associated with increased cases, we have the operational flexibility and structure in place to react under all circumstances. Thanks largely to our cost reduction actions and capital raise earlier in this year. We are well positioned financially, but we remain prudent in managing our costs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to increase in a sequential basis and are confident that our momentum will position us to see meaningful growth in 2021 relative to pre-COVID 2019 levels.
At this time, I will now turn the call over to Randy to take you through our financial results.
Randy Meier
Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Iâd like to start the financial overview with a summary of our topline results and then provide a little more detail on our income statement. In the third quarter of 2020, Intersect ENT reported net sales of $22.7 million, compared to $24.1 million in the same period of 2019, a decrease of 6% from the prior period.
On a sequential basis, our sales performance increased approximately 132% from second quarter levels, as elective surgeries resumed and ENT office base procedures increased as states ease shelter-in-place restrictions.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2020 were $52.3 million, a decrease of 32%, compared to the $77.4 million in the same period of 2019. Decreased resulted from the impact of hospitals suspending elective procedures and reduced ENT office visits related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the second quarter.
For the third quarter 2020, PROPELS product family revenues were $21.1 million, a decrease compared to the third quarter of â21 -- of 2019.
SINUVA generated record sales of $1.7 million, representing a 53% increase from the third quarter in 2019, resulting from improvements in reimbursement and our market access processes and increasing awareness of and comfort with buy-and-bill with physicians.
Product mix for PROPEL was similar in the recent quarters with PROPEL at 31%, PROPEL Mini at 35%, PROPEL Contour at 34%. Overall, PROPEL family ASP in the third quarter of 2020 was $845 per unit, up 2% from a year ago and stables with the second quarter of 2020.
Gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 65%, compared to 80% in the same period a year ago. We are seeing a meaningful improvement sequentially, up from 25% in the second quarter of 2020.
First nine months of 2020, gross margin was 59%, compared to 81% last year. Year over year decrease for both periods was driven by our decision to idle our manufacturing facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting an unfavorable impact, higher per unit manufacturing costs, as well as an approximate $600,000 idle facility expense in the third quarter. We have since resumed our manufacturing activities in the third quarter.
Year-to-date idle facility charges were approximately $6.1 million and we have incurred an inventory provision of approximately $800,000, representing a total effect on our gross margin of approximately 13%.
Excluding the impact of COVID-19 in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2020, gross margin was consistent with our original 2020 guidance. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect production volumes to continue improving allowing our gross margins to return a run rate in the low 70s by year end.
Total operating expenses for the third quarter 2020 were $26.3 million versus $32.6 million in the same period in 2019, a decrease of 19%. Operating expenses in the first nine months of 2020 were $81.1 million, a decrease of 19% over the $99.7 million in the same period a year ago. The reduction in operating expenses were a direct result of our cost reduction measures put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a delay in certain clinical trials to later in 2020 and lower sales commissions.
For the third quarter we continue to manage our costs well and combined with our higher than expected sequential quarterly revenue growth, we achieved lower rate of cash use than expected. We have significantly reduced our costs consistent with our previously announced cash savings target of $40 million in an effort to preserve cash in 2020.
We believe we will be able to achieve our cash targets through a combination of ongoing cost savings and working capital management improvements, coupled with our higher than expected revenues in 2020.
These results of our, excuse me, the results of these efforts have already lowered our operating cash burn in 2020 and allowed us to maintain a high level of liquidity. Looking ahead, we expect some of the reduction in operating cash burn in the fourth quarter will cover the incremental costs associated with the integration of Fiagon.
For the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an operating loss of $11.4 million, a net loss of $11.5 million or a per diluted share loss of $0.35, compared to an operating loss of $30 -- $13.4 million, a net loss of $12.8 million or a per diluted share loss of $0.41 in the third quarter of 2019.
The adjusted net loss excluding the impact of fair value of embedded derivatives and the cost associated with the acquisition of Fiagon is $11 million or $0.34 per share. The details of these adjustments are included in the reconciliation table in our press release.
For the first nine months of 2020, we recorded an operating loss of $50.4 million, a net loss of $52.1 million or a per diluted share loss of $1.60, compared to an operating loss of $36.9 million, a net loss of $35 million or a per diluted share loss of $1.12 in the first nine months of 2019.
Adjusted net loss for the first nine months of 2020, which also excludes the impact of embedded derivatives, as well as the transaction and restructuring costs were $49.2 million or $1.51 per share.
Now turning to our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2020, totaled $130.7 million, compared to $90.6 million at the end of 2019. We continue to manage our working capital well and our cash balances benefited from both cost reduction actions we took earlier this year and our improved revenue recovery.
As a result of the companyâs ongoing cost initiatives, continued revenue recovery and growth, and our $65 million capital raise in May of 2020, company continues to believe it has adequate capital to operate effectively through 2022.
Turning to our outlook. While we cannot predict the extent or the duration of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our financials and operating results, we believe that our recovery and procedures will continue, that most patients will return for treatment. We demonstrated earlier this year that we can quickly adapt to the rapidly changing conditions and are prepared to do so in the future should these actions be necessitated again.
Based on our third quarter elective procedure volumes and referral trends and as we disclosed in our pre-announced release, we expect fourth quarter 2020 revenues to be 85% to 90% of fourth quarter â19-- 2019 revenues.
Looking to next year, we continue to believe that 2021 revenues should grow relative to 2019 levels. In addition, we believe gross margins will continue to improve returning to the low-to-mid 70% range for the full year 2021.
Now, Iâll turn the call back to Tom.
Tom West
Thank you, Randy. Itâs a very exciting time at Intersect ENT as we are taking full advantage of the rebound in elective sinus surgery procedures to provide treatment solutions to meet the pent-up demand in patients that suffer from chronic sinusitis and to capture a greater portion of total sinus procedures.
By executing on our commercial and market access strategies, we are successfully further penetrating this large and underserved market with both our PROPEL family of products and SINUVA. The record revenue quarter of SINUVA highlighted by the higher enrollment metrics and partnership agreement with AllianceRX Walgreens Prime combined with the shift towards office-based procedures gives us confidence in our future growth potential.
Additionally, the integration of Fiagon into our business is progressing well. Their navigation and complementary tools focus on sinus procedures and align with our core offerings thereby enabling us to deliver a more comprehensive surgical solution across the sinus care -- sinusitis care continuum, regardless of the site of care.
With the addition of their navigable Vensure Balloon device, we are thrilled to have entered the adjacent balloon sinuplasty market. We believe Fiagon will be an impactful addition to our growing product portfolio and are very excited that the talented Fiagon team a part of our growing organization.
Supported by our experienced management team and ENT industry leading sales force, I am confident that we will continue to benefit from the rebound in elective sinus procedures and further penetrate the market with our innovative line of commercial products designed to improve patient outcomes.
Now Iâd like to take -- turn the call back over to the Operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator
Yes.
Tom West
Operator, would you please open the lines.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
I am sorry. Yes. Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.
Robbie Marcus
Oh! Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning.
Tom West
Yeah.
Robbie Marcus
I was hoping you could start off with the outlook, because I believe the last time we spoke the end of second quarter. Your comments were a little more optimistic on where we could be in fourth quarter. How much of that is just cautious tone striking against record new COVID infection rates and shutdowns? And how much is a difference in the recovery of the business of what you thought last time around second quarter?
Tom West
Yeah. Thanks, Robbie. Iâll take a first crack at that, and Randy, if you want to jump in. I would say the majority of that is a cautious tone as we all look at record case rates and hospitalizations. And while we feel confident that the healthcare system has learned how to accommodate the pandemic in a much better way and continue to offer elective procedures and kind of segregate the hospital environment between the COVID wards and more traditional hospital care, it is -- just looking at those numbers that gives us great pause and doesnât want us to push the boat out too far.
In terms of how we feel about the health of the business? Obviously, we saw a nice recovery in July, but that was some backlog. We saw sequential improvement from August to September on the PROPEL business and a real rebound in the hospital-based environment, which is the core of our business, while seeing new green shoots and what weâre doing in the office environment and then, obviously, SINUVA had a nice quarter. So we see positive momentum in the business. Our primary caution is predicated on the uncertainty around the pace and the depth of the pandemic reoccurring.
Robbie Marcus
Got it. And maybe Iâll just ask a couple quick clarifying questions. In the fourth quarter, how much revenue is assumed for Fiagon? Was there any stocking in the SINUVA number in third quarter, and if so, how much and how much will be in fourth quarter? And the comment on gross over 2019, is that an organic ex-Fiagon comment or is that including that and should we be assuming this is not too far off the $11 million revenue base you did in 2019? Thanks.
Tom West
Yeah.
Robbie Marcus
â¬11 million [ph]?
Tom West
Yeah. Quite a few things there. Firstly, they take this SINUVA and SINUVA shocking in the third quarter. There was a very small amount in the range of $50,000 to $60,000 worth as the initial units went in for Walgreens, but very modest and thatâs really it. Other than that it was really primary demand going through.
In terms of what to expect from Fiagon in the fourth quarter, near zero. And I would also caution folks relative to that assumption on the $11 million in 2019 revenue that you just assumed, again that was under the basis of an existing distributor relationship with their partnership with Entellus and Stryker, which has basically been idled for more than a year now.
So we view that the acquisition has really a technology acquisition enabling us access to navigation, as well as to their own sinus balloon and that is business that we will need to build. I think it will contribute nicely in the back half, but I think $11 million is a -- is more value than is there right now for us. We will have to rebuild that business.
Robbie Marcus
Got it.
Tom West
Yeah.
Robbie Marcus
Helpful.
Randy Meier
Yeah. Just let me just add couple things. One, just as you know, with the acquisition, we acquired some relatively new technologies, obviously, as Tom talked about in our prepared remarks, the Vensure Balloon was just approved in August and they have an updated version of their navigation tool.
Both of which we are scaling production right now. So not that there isnât current demand, weâre hearing a lot of real positive feedback from our docs. In fact, thereâs a couple of early orders that we are trying to look to fulfill. But weâre ramping up production and those launch quantities wonât really be prepared until we get into the mid-first quarter.
So itâs not that there isnât enthusiasm for the products, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, but thereâs just some timing of the increase of the inventory to prepare to sale. So I just wanted to clarify that as a reason that weâre not getting a whole lot of revenue in this quarter.
Robbie Marcus
Thanks. Iâll jump back. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Tom West
Thanks, Robbie.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
Bob Hopkins
Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just curious, given how much the world has changed literally in the last like 10 days to two weeks. Just curious what youâve seen over that time period. Have you actually seen things start to slow down in some of your core U.S. markets or is that not the case? Thanks.
Tom West
Yeah, Bob. Good question. Certainly, there are hotspots that are materially impacted. El Paso, Texas is the easy one to think of now. I think what weâve got to get used to is there going to be hotspots across the country that will ebb and flow.
If we think about our Q2 call, we were talking at the time about, Florida, Texas, Arizona and Southern California. Now weâre talking about the Midwest, and again, pieces of Texas. I think that that is a bit of the new normal.
But itâs not at a pace that in any way resembles what we saw in late March into April, where it really went to a standstill almost on a national basis. Weâre still seeing a very steady flow, very predictable flow of volume and orders on both SINUVA and PROPEL even through the last two weeks in which thereâs heightened awareness as a result of the media and probably enhanced even further with the election coming up tomorrow. So not a material impact. But again, hotspots are going to develop and we certainly track that as we look at the performance of individual territories.
Bob Hopkins
So, okay. Thanks. Yeah. No. I donât -- obviously, I donât think anyone expects us to go back to where we were and earlier this year. But there still are expectations out there broadly for Q4 and for next year and so just wanted to get your sense for what weâre seeing in the last couple of weeks to help inform that near-term modeling. So, but I think I hear the response.
Tom West
Yeah. And Bob, just to be clear, and thatâs really in relation to Robbieâs question. Our caution in Q4 is a function of looking at that and not wishing to push the boat out to for too far and thatâs why we indicated and guided to kind of 85% to 90% a year ago quarter.
Bob Hopkins
Okay. And also just to clarify, Robbieâs question on 2021 in the comments that youâll grow. Iâm just curious, are the comments that youâll grow related to SINUVA and PROPEL or does that include some sort of acquisition growth there. Just trying to get a sense for what your initial thinking is there, because obviously the streets modeling 8% growth over 2019?
Tom West
Yeah. Yes. Clearly SINUVA has great momentum now and should deliver meaningful growth relative to 2019. Thatâs awful, but small base. We do see strong momentum in PROPEL. But again, as a more mature business, I would not ascribe a particularly high growth rate against PROPEL.
And yes, we do expect to get incremental value in the back half of the year, as a result of the Fiagon acquisition. We havenât been more specific than that right now and Iâd like to hold off on that until we give more concrete guidance as we head into the new year.
Bob Hopkins
Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Tom West
Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.
Richard Newitter
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just the first one on Fiagon, Iâd love to just hear what the strategy is and youâre breaking into the balloon sinuplasty market, not with a drug coated balloon now, but with the more traditional balloon sinuplasty offering. You have some established players there. So can you give us a little more on what the competitive sell is? Are you more focused on the balloon? Are you more focused on the navigation differentiation in the nav -- Fiagon solution? Are you going to use pricing? Any color there would help? Thanks.
Tom West
Yeah. Great question. Itâs a little bit of all of it. We feel it is a really good fit for us overall. With the navigation capability you have tools and the ability to participate in FESS surgery with navigation and obviously the conclusion of the FESS surgery often leads to a PROPEL implant.
On the balloon side, the same is true as well, the traction that weâre getting right now in the office setting of care is to use a PROPEL Contour at the conclusion of balloon sinuplasty. So weâre able to actually offer benefit across the continuum of care to the same physician audience that weâve been calling on all along.
I think the key differentiator from a technology standpoint will be in their tube navigation for two reasons. One is very simple and small footprint, makes it a very strong candidate in the office setting of care in particular, because itâs not taking a great deal of space, itâs an easy to use navigation system, has very strong accuracy in terms of how it performs relative to others. And the piece that is most intriguing that will launch mid-first half is their photo registration capability.
What you do in a traditional navigation system is you use tactile, youâll have a probe and touch it on the face of an individual to almost characterize the topography of the face and what Fiagon has developed is a photo registration, that makes it much easier to scan the face and have increased accuracy with more touch points, if you will, from the photo registration.
They have that capability already. Theyâre enhancing it, so it can be used in a patient who is not lying down, as you would have in a hospital setting that can be used for on a patient whoâs seated upwards, which would be more typical of an ASC or an office setting of care.
Combine all that together, you are now across the continuum of care, youâre leading into appropriate use of our implants post-procedure, as well as having a differentiated form of navigation and photo registration. We think we have a very strong offering again to the same docs weâve always called on.
Richard Newitter
Thatâs great detail. Thank you, Tom. Maybe one follow-up on 2021, and Bob and Robbie, question, as Bob mentioned, the streets projecting about 8% growth off of 2019. You said donât expect too much growth out of PROPEL and SINUVA is a big kind of incremental driver. And then you have the inorganic piece in Fiagon. So, I guess, just compared to the way you talked about 2021 on our last update in July, should we kind of think of this, could you discuss growth versus â19 then too. Maybe you tempered back the SINUVA and PROPEL expectation that touch given the incremental kind of surges and the conservatism warranted there. And then the inorganic piece in Fiagon kind of allows you to get back to the same place and how do you feel about where the consensus is, which is about 8% growth, given those components? Is that meaningful growth in your view? Thanks.
Tom West
Yeah. Again, we havenât provided that specificity. I think weâre all looking to see what unfolds as the pandemic continues to rise again. I think I donât -- I want to make sure that we deliver what we say, and Iâm trying very hard to do that in all of these calls.
So I wouldnât take you off of current street guidance and I think there is appropriate caution to be had around the core business, because of the rising case rate from COVID. So I -- again, without the specificity of it, I think, in general thatâs the right mark.
Randy Meier
Yeah. Rich, let me jumpâ¦
Richard Newitter
Thank you.
Randy Meier
â¦ a little bit here to give some color. I think, as Tom suggested, we are continuing to believe that we can have growth relative to 2019. And as weâve said in the second quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement in our business. Weâve demonstrated that in both the second and the -- monthly and the second quarter. Itâs clearly in the third quarter and thatâs what weâre projecting in the fourth quarter.
And what we said is that we believe we can leave 2020 with on track to achieve organic growth in excess of the 2019 levels and then adding a small amount of incremental growth on that. So that would make us comfortable with where the street is right now with that relatively speaking about 8% growth. But that sequential improvement through year end building to a point where we believe organically we can exceed 2020, excuse me, 2019 and then Fiagon would layer in some incremental revenue growth on top of that.
Richard Newitter
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.
Chris Pasquale
Hey. One questionâ¦
Tom West
Hi, Chris.
Chris Pasquale
Hey. Good morning. One question on PROPEL in the office then one on SINUVA. So PROPEL being up 62% year-over-year in the office, very encouraging. But we donât really have a lot of context on the baseline there and where that piece of business was a year ago. So can you tell us at all, what percentage of PROPEL volume or revenue in the quarter came from the office setting?
Randy Meier
Yeah. I donât know that we break -- broken it out in that detail. Itâs still a relatively modest piece of business. But whatâs nice about it is, again, on what was a 2019 business of $105 million. If we can grow $3 million, $4 million or $5 million on that business on an annualized basis, that adds 3 points to 4 points of growth and we were just talking about a total business growth of 8 points.
So we feel very encouraged, albeit coming from a small base that we can add $1 million to $3 million of growth on the offer space alone and we think that that will accelerate. As you know, we get into the office environment with our own balloon capability.
Chris Pasquale
Okay. And in the momentum from SINUVA this quarter was nice to see. Youâve upgraded a lot of elements of the distribution and reimbursement process for SINUVA over the past year. Where do you think the weak link in the chain is at this point? Are there still areas that need to be improved for that product to really be able to flourish commercially or is there something else that you think is the gating factor so that?
Randy Meier
I would say that the piece that weâve made a lot of progress on but still have further work to do is just getting the ENT physician community comfortable with buy-and-bill. Itâs still about two-thirds of reimbursement, maybe a little bit more is medical benefit and almost all of that is buy-and-bill.
And getting physicians comfortable they actually have to put money out of pocket in advance of the procedure and then bill afterwards to be reimbursed. Now it can depending on the payer be quite economically lucrative for the physician. And some have begun to realize the benefit of that in terms of adding revenue into the office based environment.
But itâs about building that comfort and thatâs changing behavior and really, candidly overcoming some of our shortcomings from the first two years after launch, when we didnât have all of that capability in place.
But what I can say is, in the -- in Q3 our conversion rate on buy-and-bill improved dramatically, still have further to go. Thatâs why I refer to the sand in the gears. But I think that itâs much about getting physicians comfortable. Now that we have the payer environment locked up with 80% of commercial lives and 90% of public lives, itâs just that building muscle and comfort, which I think will come with time.
Chris Pasquale
Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler.
Adam Maeder
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One from me on gross margin, just in light of the Fiagon deal, so the legacy products, obviously, carry very high gross margins. Should we be thinking about gross margin over the medium to longer term with the Fiagon assets integrated into the business? I guess thatâs question one and I am going to ask the follow up.
Randy Meier
Sure, Adam. Gross margins are coming back pretty nicely now. As we indicated earlier in the year, we had some high cost end inventory to burn through. Because of the recovery in our revenue, weâve burned through that.
Weâre starting to ramp up production. So a lot of what weâve seen in the idle capacity costs should be subsiding and we should start to get back to what Iâd characterize as more normal gross margin run rates, as we hit towards the end of the year and positioning as well as we get into 2021.
Relative to Fiagon, weâve actually been pleasantly surprised as weâve come in and had the opportunity to really dig into third-party manufacturers. What the fully loaded cost would be across the portfolio.
And so weâre probably a little bit more optimistic now into what a consolidated gross profit margin would be as we go into 2021 and probably the second half of the year when we start to realize higher volume relative to the balloon and the disposables.
Probably not enough to take us off sort of the low-to-mid 70s target we have for the year. But certainly, weâre optimistic about where we could end up as we start to get through 2021 and then longer term getting back to sort of higher 70% -- 70s kind of gross profit margin.
Adam Maeder
Okay. Thanks for the color there. Very helpful. And then just sort of the follow up, I wanted to ask about competitive dynamics. Just wondering if youâve seen any changes from a competitive standpoint in recent weeks or months just from the therapeutics competitors? Thanks so much for taking the questions.
Tom West
So to answer that, I mean, certainly, Dupixent has picked up overall. Difficult to say how much is directly attributed to polyposis in the ENT space. I think weâre hearing a little bit more about it. But we also know that the payer side of the equation is looking at it very cautiously, given the amount of expense associated with it.
Certainly, we believe that SINUVA represents a far more cost effective alternative than Dupixent overall. But I would say that the monoclonal antibodies are having a bit of a pickup in overall adoption and we do believe that some of that is in the ENT space as well.
Again, I think, people are looking for alternatives other than having to go into hospitalization, which is exactly whatâs driving our office based business and the rise in our SINUVA business. But if -- I do believe that the monoclonal antibodies are meaningful in the space.
Adam Maeder
Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.
Ryan Zimmerman
Great. Thank you. Can you hear me okay?
Tom West
Yeah.
Randy Meier
Yeah.
Ryan Zimmerman
All right. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up on Fiagon first, I think, Robbie, alluded to the $11 million and that was really driven by partnerships with companies like Stryker and I think previously Smith+Nephew. So I guess the question for you around Fiagon is, and I donât think youâre going to talk about kind of where itâs trending today. But what does it take to get back to that similar run rate? I mean, in terms of timing, what are you assuming for and it is a composition of revenue, letâs say, you get back to that $10 million or $11 million? Is that all navigation? Is it partly navigation, partly balloon sales? Maybe just help us understand kind of how youâre thinking about the composition of revenues coming out of Fiagon as you integrate it and what the makeup is over time? And then I have a follow up? Thank you.
Tom West
Yeah.
Randy Meier
Sure.
Tom West
Itâs going to beâ¦
Randy Meier
Okay.
Tom West
Itâs going to be a combine -- Iâll take a first crack, Randy, and then letâs turn it to you. Itâs going to be a combination ultimately of consumables, and when I say consumables, that would be the disposable tools used in FESS navigation, as well as the balloon. The consumable tools will be likely kind of earlier and first adopter as we get production ready for the balloon and competitively in the balloon space.
There are and there is an installed base of existing instruments that are out there. They are being competitively pursued by Stryker in particular. So weâre eager to get out in front of the audienceâs that currently have access to Fiagon instrumentation.
But as Randy alluded to, there are significant and meaningful upgrades to the nav system coming. So as we move into the New Year, weâll be seeking to place those. Certainly not trying in any way shape or form to play on price, I think that was something one -- somebody alluded to before, but rather playing on the strength of our nav system and the breadth of our portfolio of balloons, tools and even our sinus implants.
Randy Meier
Yeah. Probably Iâll justâ¦
Tom West
Randyâ¦
Randy Meier
â¦ add a little bit to that. One of the things I probably remind everyone is, the portfolio of what weâre -- weâve acquired versus what was being partnered in 2018 and 2019 is somewhat different. Back then it was just a older generation of navigation and disposables, and certainly, represented more of a global revenue only about 67%, 70% of that was U.S. based revenue.
What we have going forwards, as Tom indicated, is sort of an upgraded navigation system, a broader portfolio of multi-use and single-use disposables that go along with it and the balloon. And we think is, as Tom indicated, as we build up our inventories and begin to prepare for commercial launch in the first half of next year. We have a compelling offering, particularly when you think about office space PROPEL and the use of those products with a -- in a sinuplasty. So we think thereâs -- we can recapture that ground, get back to reasonable levels and certainly by year two begin to exceed what was theyâve done in the past -- or Fiagon has done in the past.
Ryan Zimmerman
Okay. Very helpful. And then, Randy, for you, you guys made a lot of initiatives around cost savings that you put in place during the pandemic and this certainly reshaped your cost structure. I guess Iâd love to understand kind of the durability of those cost savings. I mean, as revenue recovers, my guess is youâre going to expand your sales a bit more and spend more and as you launch new products. So, maybe talk a little bit about the durability of those savings and what can last versus maybe what you have -- what you can reinitiate, just given the recovery?
Thank you.
Randy Meier
Sure. I think, the third quarter really demonstrated getting back to pretty close to prior year levels that we can drive pretty good topline revenue on a much smaller cost base. And we think thatâs just indicative of improving the productivity broadly in the organization.
Youâre right, with the addition of Fiagon, we will probably, as we see sales go add in a very targeted way commercially, we do think as we enter 2021, that our cost structure has been changed for the better and then we can sustain that going forward.
There are some investments that we need to make to scale the business, as Tom indicated, and certainly in some market development areas again to continue to open up certain markets and then just improving our ability to scale a business in future years that weâll have to add to.
But, again, all those are highlighting the opportunity for us to add productivity and efficiency going forward. So, I think, weâve -- weâll be able to sustain a much leaner organization as we grow the business going forward. Tom, I donât know if you have any thoughts on that?
Tom West
Yeah. No. I think you hit the mark. In a curious way COVID gave us an opportunity to restructure the business in a more efficient model overall. And while we expand on the revenue line, yes, there will be elements of cost that return in terms of commissions and alike, we think weâve got an appropriately sized sales force.
There will be some need for modest expansion around Fiagon to support navigation and navigation servicing. But in terms of generating demand in the field, we feel we have a very efficient model and one that very much matches up to the Fiagon customer universe and I think we benefit from a leaner organization that is sustainable.
Ryan Zimmerman
Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Ravi Misra with Berenberg.
Ravi Misra
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just one -- another one on Fiagon, if I may. How do you guys kind of look at the trend towards in-office/ASC procedures. I mean, thatâs not been an area historically where the company has been very strong, but youâre buying this asset now that allows you to go kind of deeper into that channel. Letâs say, we emerge on the other side of the pandemic. Is this going to be the kind of new normal for where your sales efforts are focused? Or do you think thereâs a reversion back to procedures being done in the hospital?
Tom West
I think there will always be a strong hospital basis, particularly for the full on functional endoscopic sinus surgery that has been the wheelhouse of the PROPEL business. We have seen a gradual migration pre-COVID towards ASC as a more cost effective center for the payer community and I think that will continue. I think thereâs enough involved in that surgical procedure that it doesnât lend itself to full on FESS surgery in the office setting.
But the flip side to that is, yes, there will be, I think, an increased level of activity of alternatives to FESS surgery that will increasingly take place in the office setting and may migrate up into the ASC. And weâre seeing that with SINUVA as an alternative to revision FESS surgery. Youâre seeing that with balloon sinuplasty, which continues to have a roughly 5% growth rate and a nice sized market that we wish to enter into.
And I think that what youâre seeing in the kind of green shoots of PROPEL in the office and SINUVA in the office behind our J code is an opportunity for physicians to be able to have a separate implant code that reimburses and rewards them for conducting those procedures in the office setting, which again, is with the grain. So I donât think itâs that we will ignore the hospital setting, I think it is that the office setting will become increasingly valuable and weâll focus on it.
The other thing I will remind you is, itâs all the same docs. So a doc is in the hospital setting. You may have procedures two days or three days, where heâs doing surgeries or sheâs doing surgeries, and then be in the office setting for two days or three days and thatâs where I think we get the efficiency of our sales force and the caliber of our relationships with the physician community that makes the broader portfolio, our ability to help across the continuum of care, whether itâs a FESS surgery or itâs an alternative to revision surgery, weâre now able to offer a much broader toolkit to the physician regardless of their setting of care.
Ravi Misra
Great. And then maybe just two last ones for me, just the difference between the navigable and the non-navigable balloon and then just how youâre saying that Contour might be working in that. Just what would be the kind of use case between the navigation and non and kind of is there a better adoption take for the PROPEL product and one of those two? And then last, maybe just one, Randy, on gross margin, just on the 4Q commentary. I think youâre saying exiting the year at low 70s? Does that kind of imply for the full quarter or just kind of youâre exiting December at about that level? Thanks.
Randy Meier
Yeah. Theâ¦
Tom West
Navâ¦
Randy Meier
Go ahead.
Tom West
Nav -- you want to -- I was just going to say, nav versus non-nav is literally just as it sounds. Is it connected to the navigation system that allows the physician to be able to see on a screen where the instrument is touching and what the kind of the geography of the sinus cavity is or is it non-nav where the physician is really just having a handheld instrument and without the benefit of navigation placing the balloon in the sinus cavity and expanding it without really looking at the CAT scan in order to be able to see where the placement is and thatâs a matter of preference for different physician groups.
Navigation is growing quickly, as younger ENTs are coming into the marketplace. But itâs about 30% to 40% is navigated today and this gives us the ability to perform either way depending on a physicianâs preference.
Thereâs really no difference in terms of the application of Contour. Really the purpose of that as we think about it, you expand the balloon, it opens the nasal cavity and then by placing an implant the Contour in there, the radial force of the stent helps to hold open and provide patency to that opening that youâve just expanded, while at the same time, giving you localized drug delivery to reduce the inflammation and accelerate the healing process. And that is as applicable, whether that is navigated or non-navigated. So thatâs how that plays out. But either one is complimentary to a balloon sinuplasty. Randy, you are going to jump in on gross margin.
Randy Meier
Yeah. On the gross margins, I think, just weâre talking about sort of exiting the year, not the full quarter. Although, I think, it will depends on how quickly we ramp up production in the quarter, but itâs really just sort of an ending the year in that fashion sort of the run rate.
Ravi Misra
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity.
Kyle Rose
Great. Thank you for taking the question. So, yeah, a lots kind of been asked here, but I just wanted to ask, yeah, two maybe a question on the underlying themes that youâve talked about today. So, one, on SINUVA and then the other on the office growth. On the office growth, obviously, encouraging trends, understandably, itâs often a small baseline. But just help us understand maybe what that looks like. I mean, this is a few accounts adopting in size? Is it more dabbling across the account base? Are you seeing a lot more because of the CMS pass-through? Just trying to understand, maybe the specific driver of growth that you think is more durable from the office space side? And then on SINUVA, I realized great quarter, but itâs still a relatively small patient volumes from a historic basis. But just any sense of patients -- patient treatments here is, are you seeing patients come back to be retreated rather than potentially moving on to a revision procedure? Just trying to understand lifetime utilization and things of that sort?
Tom West
Yeah. So, first relative to the office, there was some office business previously, when we had an S code that supported PROPEL. At the time of the J code was issued, the S code was repealed and that created some confusion in the marketplace and people were not aware that PROPEL could still be covered.
So we saw a roughly $2 million office business at the time under the S code, very geographically specific, primarily among heavy balloon audiences in more kind of aggressive treatment environments, Texas and Florida in particular.
What weâre now seeing with the J code used for PROPEL is a much healthier and broader use across many geographies and thatâs a very encouraging sign for us. And weâre out there selling against that and think that we can grow that to match kind of balloon utilization in particular, because thatâs really where Contour is being used in the office setting is post-balloon sinuplasty.
There are some other instances where post-debridement they may put a PROPEL in there. But by and large, the bulk of that office business is coming from post-sinuplasty, but now much more geographically dispersed and thatâs what gives us confidence that weâll be able to grow that, because weâre seeing it on a broader basis.
On the SINUVA question and the particular one around retreatment. Itâs a very insightful question. We are seeing in pockets where physicians are using SINUVA on a retreatment basis, where somebody has come in, theyâve had it for 90 days, they may have a lag between and then theyâll reinsert another SINUVA later in the year.
That is still more cost effective than revision FESS surgery. It certainly is more cost effective than a monoclonal antibody and weâre starting to see some of that. It has us contemplating whether or not we match that with a clinical study in order to be able to improve our labeling and have the right kind of documentation against it.
But, again, weâre encouraged by physician repeat use. So weâre now getting some physicians who are using more of the products, not just selectively here and there, but where physicians are repeating across multiple patients, but where physicians are coming back, again a very positive sign that the adoption curve is improving.
Kyle Rose
Great. Thank you very much for that additional detail there. And then one other question I just had is just, the health of the underlying account base. Just -- do you expect to add accounts in 2020, given all the moving pieces with COVID and I am just trying to understand what that account growth looks like on a go-forward perspective? Thank you very much.
Tom West
Yeah. Itâs a good question. Itâs a little hard to tell right now, particularly because of COVID. Youâve had a number of ENTs that have actually left the market. Theyâve retired. Theyâve closed shop. And yet, at the same time, we do keep track of new accounts and weâre still getting new accounts that we havenât had before.
So itâs a little blurred by the environment overall and itâs a metric that we look at and as Iâve said, itâs hard to distinguish between folks exiting the market, consolidation of the market, which means you havenât lost a physician but theyâve become part of a broader practice or an IDN.
But we also are seeing new patients, new customers, I should say, new customers, new accounts coming on Board. So I donât have as clean an answer on that as I would like. Other than to say that I -- it does appear that -- the clearly the worst of April, May is way behind us and the return to normalcy despite rising case rates appears to be manifest in the data in terms of where weâre shipping product to and the number of accounts that we -- to whom we ship.
Kyle Rose
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Oath [ph] with Oppenheimer.
Suraj Kalia
Good morning, Tom. Randy. This is Suraj. Sorry, my phone dropped off. Can you hear me all right?
Tom West
Yeah. Got you.
Randy Meier
Yes.
Suraj Kalia
Perfect. So, Tom, a bunch of questions have been asked and maybe I can ask it from a different flavor. But if we were to get comfortable with, letâs say, 8 percentages growth for FY â21. Does that also factor in a 2%, roughly 2% ASP increase? And also a sub-part to that question, what are you seeing as conversion times for patients from diagnosis to intervention currently and moving forward?
Tom West
Yeah. So we havenât broken down all the components of the growth and I think it would be premature to do it now. We have realized ASP improvement of 2%, your numbers are accurate there. We have been able to sustain that ASP and slight ASP increase even in the face of some of the economic challenges brought on by COVID. So I think thereâs durability in it. But in terms of the specific breakdown of the composition of our growth rate, weâve not gone into that detail yet. Your second question was onâ¦
Suraj Kalia
Conversion times, just conversion times new patient inflow and how soon are they being converted? What is the trend line youâre seeing?
Tom West
Yeah. So, again, thatâs the most -- that question is most relevant to SINUVA. In terms of a PROPEL hospital based visit, itâs -- theyâre going to schedule the time. Itâs going to be an element of hospital supply and available an inventory at the hospital setting.
But SINUVA is a different pathway, because youâre initiating drug therapy in a doctorâs office. Therefore, you need to get benefit verification in advance and then ensure that the specialty pharmacy delivers product on time, and therefore, the procedure can take place.
Our benefit verification times are down dramatically, which is great. It shows that our hub is becoming more comfortable and facile in determining benefit verification on what was the new category with SINUVA and then our specialty distributors, particularly with the inclusion now of Walgreens with its national reach and increased sophistication also is helping that time from start to stop.
We havenât shared that specific number, but I would tell you, it was weeks previously, it is still one -- in the one-week to two-week range generally speaking from the moment that a physician office calls the hub to determine whether or not a patient has coverage to when they are suitable to be scheduled and brought in for the procedure.
Suraj Kalia
Got it. And Tom, final question, I just want to tie it into one of the earlier questions asked about, new store sales versus same-store sales. Your PROPEL contribution, a third, a third -- roughly a third, a third, it seems very consistent and stable over the last few quarters. What does that tell us about utilization and relative indications, because the contribution seems barely to budge between the PROPEL family. Any color there would be greatly appreciated? Thank you for taking my questions.
Tom West
Yeah. The one thing and I think Randy highlighted it. It is roughly a third, a third, a third at a high level. Actually, if you look at Q3 relative to Q3 2020 versus Q3 2019, both PROPEL and PROPEL Mini were down year-on-year slightly, whereas PROPEL Contour was up slightly year-on-year. And again, thatâs a reflection of that increased office utilization. Contour is most suitable for use in the frontal sinus cavity, which is where your balloon sinuplasty is also most effective, which is why you see that slight difference.
The real key to cracking open, the growth rate and change in PROPEL will come from having additional health economic evidence to support a separate carve out for the PROPEL implant separate from the surgical procedure code. And thatâs really, when I spoke of the health economic evidence that weâre seeking to build, itâs really to actually break that open and demonstrate that a FESS procedure with a PROPEL regardless of which one and youâll use a different one depending on which sinus cavity youâre talking about.
What will break open that number and kind of get the stagnation done in the long run, is the ability to have that separate carve out implant code in addition to the overall procedure code, which is whatâs been accomplished with other implants in ophthalmology and other segments.
Randy Meier
Yeah. Suraj, I guess, just to add some, go back to your original question about sort of growth. As Tom has clearly indicated here, the base PROPEL business is continuing to recover very nicely and itâs a very stable business.
But as Tom talked about, when we made our original analysis of Fiagon, we now have a variety of other opportunities to drive growth. You are certainly seeing SINUVA begin to start to pick up momentum and gain growth opportunities year-over-year. Weâve talked about PROPEL in the office and the opportunity to continue to see growth there.
But when you think about it, Fiagon is going to create some incremental growth opportunities, as well as the combination of our business and Fiagonâs business in Europe also creates incremental growth opportunities.
So while PROPEL certainly provides stability and an opportunity to see that that engine continue to grow in a fairly modest and consistent fashion, thereâs a variety of other things that we would expect to incrementally generate some growth for us as we get into 2021 and beyond.
Operator
Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Tom West for any closing remarks.
Tom West
Yeah. Thank you. And thank you all for taking the time to listen in today. I really appreciate your continued interest in Intersect. As I said before, Iâm very optimistic about where we are and proud of what weâve been able to accomplish over the course of the last year.
Just in reflecting on it, I think about this call a year ago, we still had not quite figured out the model on SINUVA and I think weâve come a long way with a record quarter and now that becomes a vector for growth for us going forward.
Our PROPEL business have been somewhat neglected and as distraction have taken people away from that business and the pace of our recovery in the hospital setting, the green shoots that we see in its application in an increasingly important office setting and a clear path on what we need to do in terms of strengthening the health economic evidence in order to be able to improve the payer and coding environment for PROPEL are very encouraging.
And on top of that, a complimentary business with our navigation acquisition of Fiagon, the access to their consumable tools and also our early entry into the balloon market with a very competitive offering, but again complements our implants and also anticipates our differentiated drug coated balloon.
As well as a increased footprint in Western Europe, where weâve had modest sales that have been growing on our implants now augmented by a larger presence that Fiagon brings. If a year ago, we had two somewhat uncertain sources of growth, I would say, we now have five very interesting sources of growth.
It will still take us some time. We will still need to play through some of the uncertainty of the COVID environment. But we think we have a clear path and momentum for sustainable growth going forward.
So, again, I thank you for your time today. I look forward to speaking with all of you in the near future, if not later today, and again, thanks very much. Take care.
