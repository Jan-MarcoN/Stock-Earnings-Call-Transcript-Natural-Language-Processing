Greetings and welcome to the QEP Resources Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference to William Kent, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
William Kent
Thank you Augean. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources third quarter 2016 result conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you have not done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results and a slide presentation with maps and other supporting materials. In todayâs conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which would be out of our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard Doleshek
Thank you, Will. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter of 2016, we generated $168.7 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is about the same as our adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter and $104 million lower than the $273 million we generated in third quarter of 2015.
Production in the third quarter was 86.6 Bcfe or 3.3 Bcfe higher than the 83.3 Bcfe we reported in the second quarter. Oil volumes were 5 million barrels, down hundred 84,000 barrels in the second quarter, mostly in the Bakken, NGL volumes was 11.6 million barrels, up 95,000 barrels in the second quarter also mostly in the Bakken. And natural gas volumes were 46.8 Bcf, up 3.9 Bcf in the second quarter, mostly in Haynesville.
Crude oil comprised 35% of our total production in the third quarter, down a couple a couple percent form the second quarter. Our updated guidance for 2016 oil production is a point estimate of 20.5 million barrels, which is up a 0.5 million barrels from the midpoint of the range of our previous guidance.
Our point estimate for NGL production is 6 million barrels, which is up a 1 million barrels from the midpoint range of our previous guidance and our point estimate for natural gas production is 178 Bcf, which is up 8 Bcf from the midpoint of range of our previous guidance.
If our point estimates are correct, the result will be 337 Bcfe of equivalent production in 2016, which is 10 Bcfe or 3% higher than our 2015 total production. Oil production will be up 5%, NGLs will be up 28%, and natural gas will be down 2% from the respected 2015 levels.
As we had said previously, the Permian Basins acquisition which we closed on October 19 will not make a meaningful contribution to production, LOE or G&A in 2016.
QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price, which includes the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $4.20 per Mcfe, which was $0.11 per Mcfe or 3%, lower that we realized in the second quarter and $1.32 per Mcfe lower than we realized in the third quarter 2015.
The weighted average field level equivalent price in the quarter was $3.98 per Mcfe, which was 7% higher than the second quarter. The equivalent price reflects field level crude oil prices that were $40.12 a barrel, field level NGL prices that were $12.26 a barrel and field level natural gas prices that were $2.63 per Mcf.
Field level crude oil revenues account for 59% of total field level revenues, which was 8% higher than in the second quarter. Derivative settlements added $19.5 million or $0.22 per Mcfe to QEP Energyâs net price realizations compared to adding $0.59 in the second quarter.
Combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $126.5 million in the quarter, up from a $122.1 million in the second quarter, and $8 million lower than in the third quarter of last year.
On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.58 per Mcfe, which was down $0.10 per Mcfe in the first quarter and transportation expense was $0.83 per Mcfe, which was down a nickel from the second quarter and transportation expenses were $0.87 per Mcfe, which is up $0.04 per Mcfe in the second quarter.
Our updated guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses is range of a $1.50 to $1.60 per Mcfe, which is down $0.10 per Mcfe in the range of our previous guidance.
G&A expenses were $67 million, which is up $23 million in the second quarter, as a result of incurring contingency losses of $25 million in the quarter.
We have increased the midpoint of our guidance for total G&A expenses by $35 million to $205 million for full year 2016. The increase in our guidance reflects the un-anticipated contingency losses we recognized in third quarter and forecasted increase in compensation expense. We expect non-cash compensation expense to be approximately $45 million for the year. If you take the unexpected loss, restructuring and non-cash expenses into account, we expect G&A to be in line with the initial guidance we provided at the beg of the year.
Capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $122 million in the quarter, up from $86 million in the second quarter, as a result of increased drilling and completion activity in the third quarter. In addition, we made $60 million of acquisitions in the quarter, primarily in the Williston Basin.
In consideration of the Permian acquisition, we have revised our guidance range for 2016 capital spending for drilling, completion and re-completion activities to be $525 million to $550. And Chuck will give you more details in a minute.
With regard to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $7.3 billion, and shareholder equity was about $3.6 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.05 billion, all of which were our senior notes and we had $1,032,000 billion of cash on hand.
During the quarter, we received the expected $156 million federal income tax refund and we repaid the 177 million of senior notes that matured on September 1st. Because the Permian acquisition last week for $590 million and that is a $30 million deposit, we spent approximately $560 million out the door, which reduced our cash balance to about $400 million, which is about where we expect to end the year.
I will now turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles Stanley
Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone. Since Richardâs already given you a summary of third quarter operational and financial results, I'll give you a quick update on our initial plans for our recently closed Permian acquisition, which were calling Mustang
Springs, share some color on our asset level operational results and then talk about our plans for the remainder of 2016, before we move on to Q&A.
On October 19 we announced the closing of our acquisition of approximately 9400 net acres in the Permian Basins of Texas. A transaction thatâs a direct result of our ongoing strategy to reposition QEP to a more balanced portfolio, both in terms of proved reserves and production, by bolting on high quality acreage adjacent to or in close proximity to our existing core oil assets.
A quick reminder of the deal highlights, the properties located in Martin County, Texas, about 10 miles east of our existing operations in the heart of the northern Midland basin. The acreage is contiguous and nearly 100% operated by QEP with an average working interest of 96% and an average royalty burden of 23%.
Our base case valuation on the asset included 320 horizontal development locations in four discrete targets, including the middle Spraberry, Spraberry Shale, the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, with identified upside totaling at least 430 horizontal development locations in the four primary target horizons, plus additional un-quantified potential development in deeper and shallower horizons.
Current net production from the acquired assets about 1400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 83% of which is crude oil. The acquired asset has net company estimated proved reserves of approximately 76 million barrels of oil equivalent, with total net company estimated recoverable resources of 275 million barrels from the four primary zones, with additional potential in shallower and deeper horizons.
So what are our initial plans for Mustang Springs, in this pace of the closing we picked up two additional drilling rigs nearly into the third quarter and we stir them up on our legacy County Line acreage where each rig has begun drilling apart of Spraberry Shale wells.
As soon as the Mustang Springs deal closed, we immediately began land work to form spacing units and subsurface damages to commence pad construction. When that construction is complete we will move at least one rig from County Line over to the Mustang Springs acreage and begin drawing a set of parent wells in each of the 4 identified target horizons. To establish initial horizontal well performance and to create baseline data, were our well density work which will commence immediately thereafter.
From a modeling perspective, we think you should model performance from the wells being drilled on County Line asset that are substantially similar to the expected results from Mustang Springs. We are excited to have this new asset in our portfolio and I am confident that we have the people, the techniques, the management systems and experience to safely and efficiently execute our plan to development on this new acreage.
Now let's review some key operational highlights from the third quarter, starting in the Permian Basin, production during the third quarter averaged more than 16,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, 86% liquids, that was a 6% decrease in the second quarter, mainly due to the timing of completion's, and a 23% increase from the third quarter of last year.
During the quarter, we completed and turned sales five gross operated horizontal wells, all in the Spraberry shale and all with outstanding results. The five wells at an average 24 hour peak gross rate of 1258 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with an average lateral length of a little over 7300 feet.
We continue to work on our wine rack geometry well density test and the A & C benches of the Spraberry Shale during the quarter, adding five roughly 7500 foot laterals to the pattern. We now have four wells in each of the A&C benches with a geometry designed to evaluate 10 wells per one-mile line wide spacing unit density in the Spraberry Shale.
The wells in this pilot or space 930 feet apart in each bench and the A&C benches are separated 160 feet vertically, with a 465 foot horizontal offset between the wells in each of the A&C benches that forms the wine rack pattern. We're quite encouraged by the performance of these wells, despite some early period frac in our fares which impacted early period production performance.
We are pleased with the post-cleanup performance of the entire family is striking our parent well site curve for the area. We should be able to minimize frac in appearance going forward by managing our development sequence to allow completion of all wells in a given walk rock simultaneously.
Our next step, on the County Line acreage is to test the viability of up to 16 well bores in a 1 mile wide spacing unit in the Spraberry Shale and we should have some initial production results from this pilot sometime in the first quarter of 2017.
We continue to evaluate an exploratory well testing a new play concept in the Woodford Shale sale in the Permian basin outside the footprint of our County Line and Mustang Springs acreage and that well was completed and turned to sales during the first quarter.
After initially falling back at total fluid [ph] rates of over 3000 barrels per day and a peak oil rate of a little over 600 barrels of oil per day, production from the well declined dramatically, even on pump the well performance seems weak and didn't match our expectations based on the rock properties we measured in the core we cut in the reservoir.
When we pulled the pump, we found a hard and solid insoluble precipitant blocking the inlet of the pump and in the case. Our analysis to date suggests we may have damaged the initial well with completion fluids which caused precipitation of this insoluble material in the well bore and maybe even in the Woodford formation target itself, thereby limiting flow from the reservoir.
We're continuing to work on next steps which range from re-stimulating the existing well to drilling another well early next year to test different completion fluids. We increased our operated rig's active in the Permian basin from one rig to near to three rigs near the end of the third quarter and they are all on our County Line acreage.
We had to QEP operate in Spraberry Shales that were drilled but not completed or ducts, both with working interest of 90%, plus a total of five QEP operated wells drilling, two each in the A&C benches of the Spraberry Shales as part of our second wine rack geometry well density I described earlier, and one in the Leonard shale all with a 100% working interest. Slides four through 11 provide details on our Permian basin properties, including our new Mustang Springs acquisition in Woodford Shale exploratory well.
Turning to Williston Basin, net production averaged approximately 57.1,000 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 86% liquids during the third quarter of 2016 and that was a 1% decrease over the second quarter and a 6% improvement over the third quarter last year.
During the third quarter, we completed and turned to sales nine gross operated wells, six on South Antelope and three on Fort Berthold with an average working interest of 87%. We continue to be pleased with the performance of a high-density infill pilot projects and with their second and third base three forks delineation well results. In the three forks in addition to 104 producing wells in the first bench on South Antelope, we currently have 14 second bench and two third bench wells in the Three Forks on production at South Antelope and all have delivered outstanding cumulative production results.
As of the end of the third quarter four second bench wells have been on production for at least 270 days and adjusting for downtime these four wells have delivered an average of just shy of 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent of cumulative production and our longest third bench well it's been online for about 240 days, has produced 282,000 barrels of oil equivalent, all a very strong results.
We had one operated rig in the Williston Basin at the end of the third quarter. It was active on our Fort Berthold lease and we plan to continue with that rig through year end. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 23 gross QEP operated ducts all on South Antelope with an average working interest of 83%. We also have interest in 12 gross docs that are operated by others and have an average of 11% interest, and those wells.
As we mentioned in our release yesterday, a commercial dispute with a midstream company that purchases, gathers and processes associated gas from our South Antelope oil wells continue to negatively impact completion activities and production volumes in South Antelope during the third quarter. Despite this dispute, we were able to find a way to complete and turned to sales six wells at South Antelope during the quarter.
The dispute continues to impact our ability to complete the remainder of our South Antelope duct inventory at a normal place. Its scheduled arbitration during the fourth quarter. So beyond these prepared remarks, I prefer not to comment further on the pending litigation.
Slide 12 through 17 have additional details on our Williston Basin assets. Turning quickly to Pinedale, net production averaged 261 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day, comprise about of 12% liquids during the third quarter. During the quarter we completed and turned to sales 34 gross operated wells with an average working interest 54%. At the end of the quarter, we had eight gross QEP operated wells in various stages of drilling with an average working interest of 56% and an inventory of six gross QEP operated ducts with an average working interest or 43%. At the end of the quarter, we had one rig working at Pinedale. We plan to operate that rig through year end.
Slides 18 through 20, provide details on our Pinedale property. In the Haynesville Cotton Valley play our net production during the third quarter averaged 133 million cubic of gas equivalent, that was a 31% increase over the second quarter of this year, and a 9% increase compared with third quarter of a year ago.
The increase in production was a result of changes in work working interest as a result of resolution of title issues, new production from our interest and several non-operated wells were completed in prior quarters and recent successful work overs of existing wells, as well as other production related adjustments.
At the end of the quarter, we had no QEP operated rigs active in the Haynesville Cotton Valley. We had interest in 11 gross operated - outside operated ducts with an average working interest of 10% and we had four gross outside operated wells in various stages of drilling and completion with an average working interest of 15%. See slides 21 and 22 for more information on her Haynesville and Cotton Valley assets.
We are very pleased with the results of our 2016 drilling program with the successes that we've had in driving down completed well cross - well costs across our portfolio and with the success that we've had organically growing our inventory of future development locations on our existing assets.
We're anxious to start work on a new Mustang Springs asset to drive profitable crude oil production and reserve growth, while substantially increasing our future development drilling inventory. As we develop the new asset, it should accelerate our crude oil production and EBITDA growth and also drive EBITDA and margin expansion per unit of production. We're excited about the addition of this high-quality crude asset to our portfolio, as we continue to execute on our strategy to reposition QEP toward a more balanced mix of crude oil and liquids rich gas production and reserves.
With that, Audrey we can open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes to David Tameron with Wells Fargo. Please state your question
David Tameron
Good morning, Chuck. If I think about the Permian in 2017, how should I think about rig allocation between the Mustang Ranch in County Line and if you go back to the Woodford, just how should we think about that split?
Charles Stanley
Tim, as we said, I am sorry, not Tim, David, as we said we those two assets as virtually identical from a geological and reservoir performance standpoint. I think the waiting will be toward Mustang Springs. But as we said in our prepared remarks, right now we have three rigs running on state line, our County Line, I think you can use the drilling activity and completed well delivery of interchangeably between the two assets.
But I'll remind you when we made the announcement of the acquisition, we said that we would start with one rig and ramp the rig count by the one rig every six months, peaking at five on the Mustang Springs asset.
That still remains our plan, but don't be surprised to see from time to time the rigs migrate, a rig or two migrate back and forth between the assets just to allow for completion sequencing.
David Tameron
Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, let me just to the Pinedale, a lot of chatter on about whether or not this asset [ph] is sold, if you look divesture, can you just give us, you know, if you choose the divestment around, can you give some more framework around what you're looking for as far as PDP or timing, tax issues all this - kind of opening a question that you run with it?
Charles Stanley
Well, at this point we don't have any formal process ongoing to sell Pinedale. I would say Pinedale is a great asset, itâs been an asset for the company over the past - over a decade now, decade and half and continues to have a lot of upside potential.
Things that we consider with Pinedale are the current contribution to EBITDA roughly $125 million in round numbers and the impact of a potential sale on leverage metrics, as well as the significant complement as you mentioned of proved developed producing reserves of any impact on their PV-10 improved reserves..
That being said, turning in our portfolio is always under examination for asset optimization, as we continue to pivot the company to a more balanced portfolio of crude oil and natural gas. Richard do you have anything to add?
Richard Doleshek
Dave, on the tax front, you know as we sort of demonstrated the last two years, the best way to monetize the net operating loss that you generate through the IDCs of your drilling program is to have income. And so in terms of tax leakage associated with the sale of Pinedale by carrying back NOLs in the two years after the transaction happens, we can probably squeeze that tax leakage down to your 10% to 15% of total proceeds of that timeframe. So tax leakage matters, but it's not as daunting as you might think
David Tameron
Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho Securities. Please state your question.
Tim Rezvan
Hi, good morning folks. I know you prefer not to comment on the arbitration thatâs ongoing, but it sounds like it will be - behind you all by year end. So I was wondering if you give some color on how you are thinking about activity there in 2017, given - you given some color on your Permian plans.
Charles Stanley
We had a board meeting earlier this week where we discussed a number of scenarios around 2017 and obviously part of that Tim is driven by commodity prices going into the end of November. I think there's a lot of questions around crude oil prices and obviously gas price volatility is also been quite high over the past week or so.
So right now I don't - we don't have a board approved plan for 2017. I feel like I'll be getting out over my skis a bit start to give you well or rig counts across the assets going into '17 until we have further clarity on commodity prices and finalize our view with the board on our level of capital spending.
One of the things that we've given some guidance on the Permian basically to give you sense around doing what we said we were going to do with ramping up activity there in conjunction with Mustang Springs asset. But beyond that I'm not prepared to comment at this point.
Tim Rezvan
Okay, okay. Thatâs sort of understandable. And then I was wondering if anybody, maybe Richard could give color, any more details on unanticipated contingency loss in the third quarter, the Q I guess, ambiguous kind of comments, there is really not a lot of detail there, can you add anything?.
Richard Doleshek
Yes, the $25 million, it was a contingency for legal wells accrual relate to the matters that we described in note 10 and the challenge in making disclosure versus - in the Q and trying to give you color is, we can't comment a lot about our legal matter. So, kind of what you get in the Q is what you're going to get, sorry.
Tim Rezvan
All right. Okay. Fair enough. And then one last one, anything you said on horizontal drilling in the Pinedale, either with what you've done or what you think from I think Ultra who is active there?
Richard Doleshek
Tim, we have filed for spacing with the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission to drill horizontal well in the east flank of our acreage. We continue to evaluate the target horizon that we would - that we would drill and watch the offset results. So far we haven't seen anything formally out of - the offset operator on their walls also were anxious to hear how that well does because it would obviously help and inform us on what we target in that well.
Tim Rezvan
Okay. Thank you.
Richard Doleshek
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line Brian Corales with Howard Weil. Please state your question.
Brian Corales
Good morning, guys. Tom just one on the Bakken we've seen some of other companies out with increasing her EUR is quite a bit with increase and end, you all have put out some pretty big wells, can maybe comment on how you figure EUR stack up?
Charles Stanley
Thatâs a good question, Brian. Good morning.
Brian Corales
Good morning.
Charles Stanley
The only thing that I can do is I can refer you to cumulate production plots. It was provided in the car operational slides and in prior quarters and I just ask you to look at the one year to live production performance of our wells versus the other operators wells and I think you can see that our well stack up quite well in most instances above the cumulative production of other operators wells in the neighborhood.
One of the challenges with the signing EUR's to these wells even after year production is where infilling our reservoir on tight density and we are circumspect about using the current historic type curve stewards on reserves to the infill wells until we had more production history we think there's certainly good wells we think most of the PV is being extracted and a first couple of years of production that at this juncture I'm going to hold back on claiming we have one and a half or 2 million barrel or even 1.2 5 million barrel EUR wells until we see more performance history.
Brian Corales
Okay fair enough. And then Haynesville I'm assuming the work-over is a kind of every re-completions. Can you I mean with a big increase, was there bunch of re-completions in the quarter or can you give us an example of kind of where production was and where after re-completion where it goes to quirks just for as an example.
Charles Stanley
You can go out to Louisiana State data into the production performance. These were making a few hundred Mcf and they are now making 10 million a day of peace or so.
Brian Corales
Oh, wow. Okay. And how many wells have you drilled prior, roughly, about 100?
Charles Stanley
What is our total PDP count? We have 225 wells of includes our non-operated wells. That's total wells. Okay. I believe its 130 Haynesville wells that we operate.
Brian Corales
Okay. All right. Guys. Thank you.
Charles Stanley
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.
Josh Silverstein
Good morning, guys. A question for me. The first when you mentioned in the press release some thoughts around oil acquisitions obviously the focus for industry including you guys this year has been on the Permian Basin, but we recently seen some transactions outside. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the view on the M&A let's could give you a value inside the Permian versus outside?
Charles Stanley
Well, obviously the key focus as you mentioned has been the Permian that we continue to look at opportunities there. The first emphasis is on looking forward both on tuck in opportunities around our two blocks that we have now Mustang Springs and County line. To try to maximize the number of longer laterals that we can 10,000 foot laterals, a simple acquisition of 160 acres can be very value accretive to the Mustang Springs asset by allowing us to go from a 7500 foot laterals to a 10,000 foot laterals. So we're working on picking up additional acreage there.
We are also working on some trades with offset operators which are win-win deals to get the units straightened out so that both operators can bill longer laterals. We also continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire additional properties that are not immediately adjacent to those blocks beyond which I am not going to go into a lot of detail.
And the Williston, we like the Williston we think the returns well level returns in the Wilshire competitive with those in the Permian basin. The opportunity said is just not as great because as you are well aware, the ownership interest in the Williston is much more consolidated then it is in the Permian. So that presents a bit of a challenge. But our AMD team our asset messengers continue to look for opportunities to acquire substantial interest in both place.
Josh Silverstein
That's helpful and sorry if you mentioned this before about the 20+ wells and Blackrock right now and said antelope, just post any resolution there. How do you see those wells coming online as for five wells per month kind of spaced out that we okay new accelerate them?
Charles Stanley
It depends on timing of the resolution and how quickly we can get those wells connected to the gathering, the gas gathering system.
Josh Silverstein
That's it for me. Thanks.
Charles Stanley
Thanks, Josh.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kevin Smith with Raymond James. Please state your question.
Kevin Smith
Good morning, gentlemen. Most of my questions have been answered. But I just have one outstanding one. Given your plan to test even tighter spacing in Spraberry that does that mean you're fairly comfortable with us but with the current 10 well spacing?
Charles Stanley
Yeah, we feel very good about that 10 well spacing and really the driver between 10 and 16 wells is mechanical interference. The oil in place in the target reservoir supports the 16 while density. Just a question as to whether or not we can place those wells in the reservoir and automatically interview to the point where we diminish performance on the individual wells and the only way we can do that is by piloting.
In some areas you'll note from the comments that we have a 10 well pattern wine rack pattern in the letter a and C benches of the Spraberry and in some places Spraberry Shale and in some places we see three distinct benches the separated by blackberry as A, B, C bench and those areas we think 16 wells spacing is very likely in the areas where only the letter a and C are present there is no frac Barry to create a third bench, maybe more problematic. We just need to test it to see.
Kevin Smith
Okay. That's helpful and then is that a blanket statement on kind of all three the Woodford County line and Mustang Springs or is that really just a County line?
Charles Stanley
I think there is lateral, even though these are Deepwater relatively continuous reservoirs, there are - there is lateral variability in the frac barriers the thickness of the frac barriers and the mechanical hardness our integrity of the frac barriers that varies laterally. In some places of the interval may be subdivided into four benches so it's not just in the County line acreage.
It also exists in Mustang Springs. The Woodford is a different animal altogether. And it's a relatively thick interval. We've targeted what we think is the best looking part of the Woodford in the first well that we drilled but there are multiple horizons within the Woodford interval as well.
Kevin Smith
Okay. Thank you.
Charles Stanley
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Please state your question.
Neal Dingmann
Good morning, gentlemen. Chuck, just wondering I guess I was looking at that slide 6 about sort of when you look at Permian when you think about Permian completion inside how you guys they can either when you test the wine rack or just the exhibit of prior area about sort of prop and lateral. I've noticed 16 you continued at about I guess what 14, 1500 pounds versus previously you were little higher than that I just wondering over how you think about the completion this time?
Charles Stanley
I think a couple things, Neal. One, as we've progressed through time, we've changed the cluster spacing within stages. We've also started to increase proppant loading and so what you're looking at here obviously is backward looking so it's not necessarily an indication of what we're pumping today.
But we have seen depending on interval that there is an optimal profit loading above which you don't seem to see any material performance improvement in wells and it's by target reservoir so another was in the Permian, the Spraberry shale completions may be different in terms of proppant loading than the middle Spraberry just because of treating pressures, closures, stresses, et cetera.
And again, you might see an entire different completion designs that results in severe well performance in the Williston Basin in the Bakken and reports reservoirs. So we're trying to do as much completion optimization as we can obviously because there is a cost component to all of this as well as a well performance component. So it's the optimization around those variables.
Neal Dingmann
Got it. And then just lastly just on sort of acreage looking at Permian. I guess it's fair to say argue continuing you mentioned I think Josh is somebody asked about M&A. Two questions that are just one are you just continue to look at both on sort are you looking at UN other larger acquisitions like your most recent 9400.
And then secondly, just noticed I guess on that slide 7 where it shows the County line, that acreage seems a little bit less than what you also in the second quarter slides. These are just some acreage you'd let go there how should we think about the bride versus new acreage?
Charles Stanley
So I don't - the acreage number hasn't changed a bit I think it may be a graphical change.
Richard Doleshek
We shared prior with the total acreage in the Permian we're just highlighting the acreage specifically in County line.
Neal Dingmann
Okay. Thanks.
Charles Stanley
And then your second question?
Neal Dingmann
Bolt on versus large acquisition?

Yes, so the bolt on acreage obviously is our first emphasis because we are drilling real-time we are drilling wells out here and we're creating a spacing units and obviously the longer the lateral, the higher the TV and high the return on an individual well boar.
The focus here is to try to drill 10,000 foot laterals the where we can either acquire additional 160s and additional blocks that allow us to drill 10,000 foot laterals instead of 7500 foot laterals, we're focused on doing that. But we are also very much aware of other large acreage block opportunities and we're continuing to pursue those as well.

Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Simons Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.
Kashy Harrison
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was just wondering if you guys could just shed really any color just more color on the exploratory acreage in the when core card County targeting the Woodford.
Charles Stanley
So it was designed to test the play is basically a Woodford Shale exploratory play. It is, the Woodford Shale is unborn social rock in fact it is the source rock for crude oil contained in a number of the structure fields along the central basin platform. So we know it's active. We know it's generated. We had source rock data on not only from the well that we drilled in court but also from other wells drilled regionally, vertical wells drilled weekly across essential basin platform.
The Woodford is obviously the same rock that produces prolifically in the southern part of the Antarctica basin and the scoop stack play as well as Cana [ph] play. It's generally time equivalent to the Marsalis as well so it is a known prolific Devonian age source rock.
Will we compared the Woodford on essential basin platform to the Woodford in the scoop play, we find it's thicker, it has a greater amount of organic content and it is similarly situated with respect to the generative window and our areas actually a little less cooked so less gassy but it's generally thicker and when you calculate an oil in place number based on the log and board we have there's more oil in place.
The challenge as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that we have a chemistry problem, we think, related to the completion fluid, the water that we used to frac the well and some material that lives in the rock that when the chemistry of the water touches the material that lives in the rock, it creates a solution that precipitates in the well bore and on the pump and we fear in the perforations that potentially in the fractures.
And this precipitate is a complex mineral that is not soluble in water or even in acid. So once its forms, it's sort of there. So the game is to try to figure out a way to avoid ever forming and that's what we're working on with outside consultants and chemists to try to come up with a completion design that uses water that will not cause us tough to ever form.
Kashy Harrison
Thank you. That's really great color there. On the earnings release there was some mention about increasing, increasing inventory for cold rolled based on the recent oil resulted I was wondering how do you think about current inventory today for cold and what do you think the potential inventory could increase.
Charles Stanley
I don't think we've ever formally released an inventory number there. I think there's at least a couple of hundred additional development locations I think it could go up from there based on the same infill development spacing tested that we're doing on antelope because, again, the issue is not oil in place and recovery factor.
It's mechanically whether or not we can put the wells floating up together that increase the inventory of materially could double, I think it could, depends upon further testing of the closely spaced wells as we're doing at South antelope.
Kashy Harrison
All right. That's it for me.
Charles Stanley
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.
Dan McSpirit
Thank you and good morning. Turning to the Permian basin how do you see the relationship between productive capacity and take away capacity playing out over time maybe both specific to the company's operations as activity levels increase and maybe industry-wide could just asking in an effort to better assess the bottleneck risk here.
Charles Stanley
Dan, it's a great question, ad when we've been thinking a lot about. First, just on our acreage footprint, we are planning on constructing and moving, constructing an infield gathering system to move all of our crude to central point and maybe away from the acreage of ways to deliver it into vocal pipelines and multiple takeaway points, so that we maximize the market flexibility but as one of the folks that's helping us think about this problem, pointed out.
If we were looking at it fairly large-scale map that covered the entire basin than you can put a bottle cap off of a bottle of water on our acreage and he said of you guys intimate did make secure 70,000 barrels of day underneath his buttercup and everybody else's legitimate going to have to be a heckuva [ph] lot more pipe built and that's an understatement and I think as the industry ramps up in response to improving crude oil prices, the other structure developers are going to get focused on creating additional takeaway capacity or is going to have to be build where it's got become a throttle on overall development of the Permian basin not only on the Midland side but on the Delaware side as well.
So we are keenly aware of it. We're talking to a number of project developers who are already working on the next big pipe out of the area and the question is, where does it get built first and obviously, the begin basin infrastructure is pretty robust to move oil amount unloaded into a newly developed pipe so our focus right now is on making sure we can get our oil to the most pardon the pun liquid points in the basin so that we can access multiple Takeaway points.
Dan McSpirit
Got it. And just follow up again on the Permian basin, just in terms of operating cost and differentials here going forward with more capital going to the Permian basin exterior and I guess with it activities levels increasing can you give us a sense of what that means for lifting costs and what it should look like for differentials on oil 2017 and periods beyond.
Charles Stanley
Well I think generally lifting cost will slide down some because we are continuing to supersede vertical oil, higher cost vertical oil production from County Line with more and more horizontal production as the vertical wells, the higher LOE vertical wells continue to decline and we put on more new high rate of horizontal wells.
The 1400 barrels a day we have in Mustang Springs is pretty high lifting cost up because of the strong 93 vertical producing wells and obviously it will be overwhelmed by the first families of horizontal wells come on. So I think flat to declining, Eloise [ph] is certainly a reasonable base assumption. Richard can give you some more color.
Richard Doleshek
And then, in terms of absolute dollars a lifting costs in the Permian have been your tracking about two, $2.5 million per month this sort of swing is that on the work-over sides of the base level LOE is staying pretty consistent so when you add more production goes down to per LOE basis and as I've told you before, we dramatically reduced those cost from 15, 16 bucks about in the first quarter of 2015 to below five bucks per barrel. So pretty stable in our think is in production lowered operator basis.
Dan McSpirit
Got it. Have a great day.

Our next question comes from Gabe Dowd with JPMorgan. Please state your question next
Gabe Dowd
Hey, good morning, everyone. Just thinking about 2017 just like what you mentioned 10% oil growth is kind of the bogey is that what we should think about 2017 at least initially?
Charles Stanley
With the caveat that we don't have a board approved budget and we're also still waiting and watching oil prices because obviously it's very volatile times in the market and while things certainly feel better from a supply demand balance, I think there's still some pretty big wildcards out there that could impact prices and obviously prices will drive our activity level.
Gabe Dowd
Thanks. That's helpful. What will be the ultimate governor in terms of spend as you think about next year. Is there a leverage metric you guys want to stay within, is it going to be living within cash flow again this year, you mentioned last quarter comfortable with maybe one to the 50 million cash out and is that still how we should be thinking about it?
Richard Doleshek
Hey, Gabe, its Richard that while we did the equity offering back in June we sort of engineers the sides of it to cover the outspend that we were forecasting in 2017 and caring that into 2018. Our goal is to incur no incremental net indebtedness, certainly in 2017 and probably into 2018.
That may change if commodity prices move but I think the $2 billion that level is sort of where we are comfortable and again we engineered the equity offering in terms of size to cover the outspend that we think we'll see next year and then into 2018, so no metric per se. I think the dollar amount is kind of where we are looking and the EBITDA will grow to the comfortable metric and 2018.
Gabe Dowd
Got you. Thank you. That's helpful and then maybe just a rate fabrication for me, in the Permian we talked about going up and I think 106 months, when you entered 2017 on what it would you be running for and you pick up the Smith in the summer. Is that how we should be thinking about the timeframe?
Charles Stanley
Again, part of that depends on what happens with crude oil prices and our decision around drilling another Woodford well our Woodford exploratory play because we're going to do that were likely to do it early in the year so we may pick up what I would call floater rig not a real floater but a rate that is specifically drilled at exploratory well.
Gabe Dowd
Thanks you, Chuck. And maybe I'll squeeze in one more. Think about Mustang Springs and County line. Is there a total number of rigs that Eurovision you could write on that asset in total? Is it seven, eight, nine, 10, just try to think about ultimately what kind of work program you can run on the combined asset?
Charles Stanley
At big we could comfortably run eight, probably nine. But, again, they're going to jump around back and forth between the assets which is one of the things we liked about the addition of Mustang Springs because it gives us an opportunity to seamlessly move drilling and completion activities back and forth between the two assets.
Gabe Dowd
Got you. Thanks, Chuck. That's all I had.

Our next question comes from [indiscernible] on with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Please state your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to South Antelope at the that's real to access their despite the ongoing images of Glen Oak and you talk about more about what allows you do that obviously disputed still ongoing. As an opportunity related to another counterparty for opening those of an are you able to do more of this in you for Q4?
Charles Stanley
Since this is a subject of ongoing dispute in litigation I just prefer not to speak about it anymore.
Unidentified Analyst
Fair enough and maybe just jumping into the Permian I know you talked about variability in terms of what designs work in different places. On the states like site specifically and keeping in mind that the slides and the graphics there are backward looking. It looks like just eyeballing it around 235 to 240 feet, just try to get a sense of urgency opportunity to tighten their just given somewhere leading-edge basis and what can I delete, in terms of what you might be testing now.
Charles Stanley
We're already headed that way as I said the statistics as we will put them are always backward looking. We are squeezing the stages down the stage like down in the cluster spacing is down to 30 feet now?
Richard Doleshek
It's heading toward 33 negative is heading toward 33 cluster spacing.
