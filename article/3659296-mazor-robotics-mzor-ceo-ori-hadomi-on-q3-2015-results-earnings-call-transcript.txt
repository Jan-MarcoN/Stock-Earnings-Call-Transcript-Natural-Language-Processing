In Mazorâs press release and the financial tables used earlier today, which is located on the companyâs website at www.mazorrobotics.com, you will find definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the closest GAAP financial measures, as well as a discussion of why these non-GAAP financial measures are relevant to the companyâs results.
With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Ori Hadomi, Chief Executive Officer. Ori, please.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael, and welcome to Mazorâs third quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the quarterâs results and then we will review the overall market environment and our near and longer-term strategy, as we seek to build on our leadership position in the robotic spine surgery market.
As we previously announced early last month, we sold three Renaissance systems in the third quarter of 2015. Although the number of system sales fell below our internal expectation, the strategic important of the three systems sold is significant and will improve our growth potential. On a global basis, we ended the third quarter with 96 Renaissance systems with 56 in the U.S. compared with 77 and 44 systems at the end of Q3 2014 respectively.
Our performance in the first quarter did achieve several objectives, mainly selling in two academic centers and penetrating new markets, including two significant sales in the largest metropolitan market in the U.S., which has been a goal of ours this year. We reported revenue of $5 million in the quarter with recurrent revenues continuing to demonstrate strong growth in the quarter, as it increased to $3.3 million, which represents a 32% rise compared with the year-ago third quarter.
Before I discuss our third quarter performance, I want to take a few minutes to highlight something we are very excited about at Mazor and something that really demonstrates the strength of Mazor, our innovation. As we have reported in previous quarters, we continue to invest significantly in research and development to ensure our innovation leadership in the spine robotic market. To date, Renaissance is the leading and only FDA-approved robotic device, and our goal is maintain our market leadership while competition is anticipated to enter the spine market. We will achieve this by having the most advanced technology supported by robust clinical data to deliver the most clinical and economic valuable position to our customers offering game-changing capabilities.
Some of the recent fruit of our investment in R&D were presented at last monthâs North American Spine Society meeting took place in Chicago, as we introduced for the first time our clinical solution product strategy with the PRO solutions. The PRO solutions represent a new product strategy allowing us to deliver more complete solutions for specific procedures, where the valuable position is maximized rather than focusing only on the platform itself. The PRO solutions we introduced include solutions for spinal deformity surgery, trauma, and lateral procedures, and I will elaborate.
The first solutions we introduce and will be fully commercial in 2016 is the PROlif Lateral, which targets the lateral fixation market. It enables the guided placement of pedicle screws while the patient is lying on their side for an XLIF type of fusion. Usually, in these cases surgeons have to change the patientâs position to a prone one for the posterior instrumentation, which means redraping. This process in which a patient is being flipped to a prone position often takes between 45 to 60 minutes.
However, with the Renaissance being mounted to the patient while lying on their side, there is no need to flip the patient reducing the OR time by up to an hour. For those of you who attended our Analyst Meeting in Chicago three weeks ago, you had a chance to hear first-hand from Dr. Poelstra about his experience with the PROlif Lateral. In his captivating talk he clearly stated that if he does two such cases a day, he can add on an extra case.
So beyond the clinical value to the patient, it can also be immediately translated to real economic value to both the surgeon and hospital by adding another surgery, which is true incremental volume. There are now a handful of surgeons who are benefiting from the PROlif, and based on some early feedback, I believe many others will join their ranks.
Another solution we showcased is the PROdef software, which targets corrective surgeries for spinal deformity. While there are competing solutions that surgeons can refer to in order to review their correction planning, most are passive and two-dimensional. Mazor PROdef works in 3D, while being based on weight-bearing parameters, which are updated in real-time as the surgeon performs a virtual surgery on the imaging. Surgeons reacted with significant enthusiasm to the ability it provides them and we are excited to help redefine how deformity surgery will be approached by surgeons.
Iâm confident that these and other cutting-edge products Mazorâs team is developing will continue to delight surgeons maintaining our market leadership. Mazor will continue to invest significantly in our innovation efforts, making sure, we maintain and increase our competitive advantage in the market. I believe in our mission, healing through innovation, by developing and introducing revolutionary robotic-based technologies and solutions that will redefine the standard of care in spine surgery.
Now allow me to review the three systems we sold in the US. In the Pacific Northwest, we installed our first system in the State of Washington at Capital Medical Center located in Olympia. We also sold and installed two systems in New York City metropolitan area. Hackensack University Medical Center a teaching and research hospital is our first system in New Jersey and is just a short drive from midtown Manhattan. The other system was installed in Manhattan, and although we are still restricted from naming the institution, it happened to be one of the largest and most comprehensive hospitals in the US.
We expect the hospital to make an announcement in the near future about expanding its world-class spine program to now offer surgeries with Renaissance. Penetrating the New York City market has been a goal for â of ours for sometime and represents one of the biggest achievements to-date.
At the end of the third quarter, our sales team was actively engaged in several high-level commercial discussions in both the U.S. and international markets. Our team continued to pursue deals and to-date in the fourth quarter we have received orders for two additional Renaissance systems in China and are making good progress in other prospective accounts in the U.S. market and abroad.
When reviewing our existing customer base, we have performed approximately 13,000 procedures to-date, with about half of the cases utilizing the Renaissance system being minimally invasive procedures, including multilevel cases. This continues to exceed the broader market share figures for MIS cases, which are estimated to be in the range of 12% to 13% of instrumented spine cases mainly single-level cases and rarely include more than two levels. At about four times higher, we believe it demonstrates that the Renaissance is indeed an enabling technology for MIS spine surgery.
Furthermore, the clinical data in the scientific literature that favors an MIS approach is usually significant for two-level cases and less so for one-level cases. So by enabling an MIS approach for long infusions with larger constructs, Mazor can impact the cases that truly benefit from a minimally invasive approach both clinically and financially. Interest in the Renaissance remains high and our pipeline continues to increase and is at record levels. We know from experience that a high majority of surgeons that try the system in our Bioskills Lab become advocates for purchasing our products with their hospital administration.
However, we canât rely solely on them to secure system sales, especially as the market environment has changed since we first launched Renaissance in the U.S. market. Today we engage hopefully [ph] early in the third quarter, so we can better address your specific needs. We have previously reported our focus on penetrating major metropolitan areas, where a vast majority of the addressable market of about 400,000 annual procedures is performed, as well as most academic institutions and teaching hospitals are located.
In the past six months, this report has led to many success in New York, Charlotte, and Northern Virginia markets, meaning, we have systems in 20 out of 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas. To sustain our effort in these and other new regions, we are actively recruiting additional talented capital sales reps to complement our existing teams. In Asia, we continue to experience a high level of interest in the Renaissance system. Our distributor partner in Taiwan, China, Australia, and Southeast Asia continued to have advance discussions with prospective customers. Our partner in China ordered two Renaissance systems in the current fourth quarter and our outlook for further market development in the region is positive.
The brain model has continued to make an important clinical impact in the neurosurgical community. Our users believe that the use of Renaissance for DBS electrode placement surgery is state-of-the-art and offers tremendous value. A joint paper from the Department of Neurosurgery in Tuebingen and Mainz, Germany was published last September in the Journal of Neurosurgery. The paper reviewed their experience with Renaissance-guided brain biopsies and concluded that it combines the stability and accuracy of a frame-based system with the flexibility and tolerability of a frameless one. While spine is the core of what we do, we are gaining traction in the brain market.
Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the third quarter, I want to provide an update on our growth strategies. First, we continued to increase our market footprint. We added several capital sales reps. And with the continued sales force adjustment, we ended the first quarter with 15 sales reps in the U.S., up from 12 at the end of the second quarter, as we continue to align our team to meet our long-term sales objective of penetrating new regions and metropolitan markets fitting new cluster for us.
Currently, we have 17 capital sales reps and we would anticipate ending the year with 21 capital sales reps, almost half of which will have been with Mazor for at least one year. We also penetrated two leading academic institutions in the third quarter and we now have 12 teaching and academic hospitals utilizing Renaissance training the next generation of surgeons with our technology. They will experience the benefits of the system, take the knowledge with them, moving us closer to becoming the standard of care. Internationally, we continued to work with our distribution partners to penetrate new hospitals and countries.
Second, we are focused on increasing utilization of the systems in use. In the third quarter, despite the seasonally slow â slowdown of the summer months, we still had robust utilization. This is the result of working with surgeons who share our vision of leading through innovation and benefiting from the value of our technology. They know that patients are benefiting from the shorter stay, reduced risk, and better outcomes. This expanding network of surgeon users is growing the utilization numbers, but I also believe the marketing of systems provided by our sales reps is helping to increase the volume.
Referral network and patients are hearing more about the value of robotic guidance. And just last week I heard a patient made an appointment with a surgeon who practiced four hours away because the surgeon uses the Renaissance. Patient awareness is also increasing and we would expect this to continue growing.
Third on our list of priorities is to deliver product enhancements and product innovations regularly to maintain a high level of surgeon satisfaction. As I mentioned earlier, Iâm encouraged by the level of interest and the feedback we are getting for the PRO solutions line. We expect to launch more PRO solutions throughout 2016. We have always sold the Renaissance system as an enabling platform, but this is for the result of working closely with our surgeons to address specific procedures using the Renaissance system that require new and innovative solutions.
Finally, we continue to engage in clinical studies and data collection. In fact, tomorrow and Saturday, the Society for Minimally Invasive Spinal Surgery will hold its global forum meeting in Las Vegas where three surgeons will have podium presentations of their studies with Renaissance. Dr. Thomas will represent his experience with the PROlif Lateral solution compared to freehand cases; Dr. Shen will present a significant reduction in fluoroscopy experience compared to freehand control; and Dr. Agha will present a new reduced radiation safety protocol for children for use with our system.
Our overall achievement in the first quarter reaffirmed my optimism and view that Mazorâs performance should be measured on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. As I mentioned earlier, we have closed several system sales already in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter. The other opportunities we are pursuing are progressing as expected, and based on this, I reaffirm my confidence, we will have a stronger second-half compared to the first-half.
Now to review the financial highlights of the second quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon.
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori, and hello, everyone. I will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2015. Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $5 million, a decrease of 18% compared to $6.1 million in the year-ago third quarter. Geographically, revenue in the U.S. was $4.3 million, or 86% of total revenue, with $0.7 million, or 14% of revenue from the international markets.
Capital sales revenue was $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease compared to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2014, as we sold three systems compared to five systems in the 2014 third quarter. Revenue from disposable kit sales grew to $2 million, a 54% increase compared with $1.3 million in the last yearâs third quarter, reflecting the increasing utilization primarily in the U.S. market, as well as increasing the installed base.
Revenue generated from service and others were $1.3 million, compared to $1.2 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP gross margin remained high at 75.9% for the quarter. Operating expense was $8.9 million compared to $8.4 million in the year ago third quarter. The increase in expense is primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing, as we recruit more sales and clinical reps in the U.S. and invest in activities to raise the awareness and broaden our sales footprint.
In addition, as Ori highlighted, we continue to invest in R&D to support increased product offerings, which includes the PRO solution line, as well as other development projects that will allow us to maintain our leadership position. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the third quarter was $5.2 million, or $0.12 per share compared to net loss of $3.9 million, or $0.09 per share in the 2014 third quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was $4.2 million, or $0.10 per share compared to $3.2 million, or $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2014.
Cash used in operating activities in the third quarter was $2.6 million compared to $4 million in the last yearâs third quarter. The decrease in cash used for operating activity is mainly attributed to our increased sales collection in the quarter. As of September 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $45 million, which provided an ample resource to execute our business plan.
That concludes my remarks. And I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. In summary, our capital sales performance in the third quarter is measured by the types of hospitals that purchased Renaissance and where they are located. They are well regarded and by this virtue, I have no doubt, it will lead to incremental system sales in the shorter-term. We continue to increase the market awareness for Renaissance and the data supporting the clinical and economic benefits and record utilization of the Renaissance systems positions Mazor to accelerate the adoption and make Renaissance the standard of care.
Our growth strategies, including the hiring of new capital sales reps in new markets, expansion of our clinical sales reps, the significant investment in innovation, and the launch of the PRO solutions line will enable us to maintain and build on our leadership position in the robotic spine surgery market. I believe 2016 will be a year of growth for Mazor.
Thank you again for joining the call. Operator, we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jeffrey Cohen from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Cohen
Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Hi, Jeff.
Sharon Levita
Hi, good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning. So just to reiterate on your outlook for the back-half of the year, so based on seven units in the first-half you are sensing seven plus for the fourth quarter?
Ori Hadomi
I agree.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay, I just wanted to check that. And could you talk about how you may report the â your PRO solutions going forward, Sharon, perhaps some commentary? And could you talk a little bit about the sales for the PRO solutions coming from the same sales force and how you may kind of rollout commercialization of those?
Ori Hadomi
Before Sharon will relay to you just to explain, the PRO solutions will be introduced commercially during 2016, so we will not see it during 2015. And we will price some of the solutions in different prices, so it will also â it will contribute to the recurring revenue. As to the reporting, Sharon, will we have separation between?
Sharon Levita
Yes. I donât see a regional separation. With respect to sales force, it will be the same sales force. Itâs really actually just a different way to introduce our product offering to the customers offering more solutions.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay, got it. And lastly, could you talk a little bit about the clinical data thatâs been out there over the past few months and any ongoing studies that youâre aware of as well as the status of some of the company-initiated studies?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. I think originally there were quite a lot of publications about the data. I think that during that there were three podium presentations about our technology and this weekend there will be three more. They all report about the value either on lateral â in the lateral approach, which is gaining a lot of interest and attract the attention of the new surgeons and this is the PROlif, as well as the studies about the reduction in exposure to extra radiation and the reduction in revision cases.
There are different papers by different surgeons, but I think that the focus is on reduction in complications, especially in minimally invasive spine surgery, reduction in exposure to extra radiation, and the benefits in the PROlif â with the PROlif solution.
Jeffrey Cohen
Perfect. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Gillings from JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.
John Gillings
Hi. Thanks for taking the question.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
John Gillings
I just wanted to start out by hitting back on PROlif really quickly. We all know that OR time is very expensive and so the ability to save 45 to 60 minutes could have quite a financial impact. Are any of the studies that are being done on that related to the economic side and when a system could potentially essentially pay for itself?
Ori Hadomi
First, itâs too early to show really comprehensive studies. I attended together with many of you and the lecture that Dr. Poelstra, who used the system for many cases with the PROlif. And he reported â and he is a very experienced and talented surgeon, he reported about the time saving together with other clinical benefits. I think that it will not take long and I will not be really surprised if already this weekend during the presentation, the SMISS conference in Vegas more economic data will be presented.
But given the high volume of lateral approaches and interest by the surgeon, I donât think it will take a long time to translate these clinical views to studies as we demonstrate also the facts about the economic use, and I think itâs relatively easy. When you compare the time it takes to flip the patient to be able to do it without flipping the patient and saving the time, we all know how much an hour in the operating room cost. And I think it will relatively â it will be relatively simple to be able to present it.
John Gillings
All right. Thanks. Thatâs helpful. And then you mentioned the ability to bring MIS to more complex procedures and thatâs obviously been very important. Can you give us some kind of sense what you are hearing from your sales force, what you hear from your contact at hospitals in terms of how cases are splitting out for the more simple, maybe one or two levels versus the more complex cases?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. So, if you look at the market standard, what we see today without Mazor and as I mentioned earlier, I think that between 10% to 13% of the cases are done through a minimally invasive approach, whether itâs minimally [ph] invasive or percutaneous, there are some vague definitions, but defined to be minimally invasive. To begin with, I think, itâs close to 40% or 50% of our cases are done today minimally invasive. 52% of our cases are done minimally invasively. And when Iâm talking about minimally invasive most of these are done percutaneously.
What we see is that some of the surgeons that used to do in the past minimally invasive for one or two levels, now they are doing five and six levels percutaneous cases. And others that never did minimally invasive, now they see that when you are operating on this system it doesnât make any difference if you are doing it openly or minimally invasively, because the system will give you exactly the same level of accuracy, predictability, and the ease-of-use whether itâs open or closed. In terms of the allocation between the single-level and multilevel minimally invasive, I think that in our case about 50% are two level and more. But I need to verify this number and we can report later.
John Gillings
Okay. Thank you. And then just one last one on the x-ray side. So Iâve spoken with surgeons at conferences in the past and it seems like a lot of times the more seasoned, more experienced guys whoâve been around for a while start to become aware that their careers could potentially even be cut short by reaching a lifetime maximum exposure. But sometimes it seems like some of the younger guys that I talked to think like, oh, thatâs fine, thatâs pretty far away, Iâll be okay. Could you give us a sense of how awareness of exposure for the surgeon is growing, and how the surgeons that you talk to are thinking about it?
Ori Hadomi
I think that you are referring to a very valid point that, to be honest, we were surprised how much interest surgeons expressed in this benefit. In the past, we thought that this is kind of an add-on benefit. But we didnât think that this would be what will take us an important role in what will attract surgeons, attract attention further into our system.
And just as you said, thereâs more and more awareness and there are more and more papers about the risk and the exposure of cancer and radiation-related disease to orthopedic surgeons, and especially in spine surgery, because of their exposure to fluoroscopic -- to x-ray radiation during the surgery. Not only that, the more they use, the more they go to complex cases and the more they try to do minimally invasive, the more they are exposed to x-ray. And because of that here we will demonstrate the value of the system.
For the Renaissance, whether itâs open or closed, whether itâs simple or complex, you donât need a different level of x-radiation. Itâs always two shots of less per second. In all the recent papers, we demonstrated that we can reduce the amount of radiation that surgeons are exposed to something to â in something to â in 70% to 90% relative to what they use without the Renaissance system. And itâs definitely attract the attention, and I think it brings a real clinical benefit to the surgeon and to the operating room team.
John Gillings
All right. I appreciate that. Thatâs all we have for this morning. Thanks, guys.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much.
Sharon Levita
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question today is coming form Mike Matson, Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Mike Matson
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to go back to the PRO solutions products. I was just curious what sort of reception you saw at NASS and which of those you think would be the most significant near-term revenue driver either directly or indirectly in terms of selling more systems. I guess, I would think it would be the lateral product, but I was wondering if you agree with that.
Ori Hadomi
Yes. First of all, I do agree with your assessment. I think what will â I think that the lateral PROlif will be of most interest during 2016. I believe that later during 2016 when we will introduce more solutions and that will come together with the PROdef. I believe that this will become a big player and what will attract surgeons. But as I hinted during the call, we didnât introduce all what we have in our tunnel. And right now, answering your questions, I believe that the PROlif, the lateral will be the most attractive solution by surgeons, mainly because the â how common the lateral approach is in the spine market in the US.
Mike Matson
Okay. And then thereâs some of the bigger players out there, particularly NuVasive, making a lot of noise about the importance of alignment. So I was wondering if that -- are you seeing that reflected in increased interest in your products?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. I think that when I relate it to PROdef, the PROdef is the next-generation of the global alignment that NuVasive introduced. The global alignment that NuVasive introduced is a 2D application and we took it a few steps ahead benefiting from our algorithmic and image processing capabilities, allowing weight-bearing and real-time simulation of the biomechanics of the patient. So when I relate it to the PROlif, as one of the future very attractive tools that I believe the market will give a lot of attention to it is, because many of the surgeons doing that came to us and were so impressed with the prototype that we demonstrated there.
Mike Matson
Okay. And then just on your sales rep count, I think you gave some numbers on the capital side. I was wondering if you could maybe give us the number on the clinical side that you ended the quarter with?
Ori Hadomi
We have today 45?
Sharon Levita
Yes.
Ori Hadomi
45 clinical sales reps in our clinical team.
Mike Matson
All right. Thatâs all I have. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Craig Bijou from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Craig Bijou
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Ori Hadomi
Good morning.
Craig Bijou
I want to start with, Ori, I know you donât provide guidance. But I did â some of your commentary about the second-half 2015 acceleration over the first-half suggests or implies that system placements will be higher than they were in 2014. So I just want to ask, how confident, given some of your expected increase in the capital sales force, how confident are you that you can accelerate system placements in 2016 and beyond?
Ori Hadomi
Yes, Craig, I should now recall all that I know, all that Iâm confident about. Weâve already got two orders and, as you know, well know, we rarely â most of our sales take place in the very last week of the quarter, independent whether itâs the first or the fourth quarter. We have very progressive discussions in a lot of hospitals, both domestically -- both in the U.S. as well as in international accounts. If you ask me personally, I feel very confident. If I wouldnât feel confident, I wouldnât say it in my call. This being fair, I canât guarantee anything.
And you know just as good as me that in the past, we were disappointed sometime from things that were very, very close to be closed and we couldnât close them on time. The priorities of the hospital sometimes are different than our intensive timetables. This time we feel that in order to exceed, as Jeff mentioned earlier, in order to make it, at least, to meet what I mentioned earlier, we need to sell seven and more, and I believe we can do it. We should do it, the team is very focused, very engaged. We implemented some changes in the focus of our team in order to make sure that we have involvement of executive team and a very experienced team in each of the territories in the U.S. and having better visibility and engagement with the accounts. So I feel confident that we can do it and I shared all what I know as of today as to the pipeline status.
Craig Bijou
Okay, thanks. And then just to follow-up on some of the Q4, you mentioned two system sales already in China. Is there any other color that you can provide on expectations of mix U.S. versus OUS, I mean, how should we think about that in Q4 specifically?
Ori Hadomi
I canât give it right now. We have our internal plans for that. But I want to wait a little bit to see some of the pipe in the U.S., how it moves forward, before I can make a more intelligent assessment. Our expectation is that because during the previous quarters, we didnât sell a lot of systems in the internationals. I expect this quarter to include international accounts systems. But we have a lot of focus today in domestic accounts and I do expect also to see a very strong movement in results in the U.S. So as to the proportion between, it is too early in the quarter to make this assessment.
Craig Bijou
Okay, thanks. And then just as my last question, I wanted to see, given some of the competition thatâs likely in the next 12 months, I wanted to get your thoughts on potential partnerships or co-marketing agreements or some other collaboration with some â with a specific implant company. I mean, your willingness to do that, or maybe if you think that will help relative to the new competition thatâs coming?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. Thank you for the question. Itâs definitely something that we are looking. We are committed to accelerate our growth. And I believe we have the strongest platform in the market right now with â there is no one with as much experience in spine robotics than us. So I believe that the big strategic players are well aware of our value and we are definitely exploring opportunities to accelerate our growth through this type of potential partnership and collaboration.
Craig Bijou
Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from [indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
Es. Good morning. And I really wanted to reflect back over prior comments that had been made, because I know your strong support and stressing, I should say, the importance of the sales force and working with their contact at the hospitals. But the focus, you went one step further, and youâve been saying, per prior quarters, the importance of the administration. And I know that back last year, there was some discussion concerning the case studies that might be formalized and made a formal part of the sales presentation process. Obviously, the ROI data is focused right at the administrator.
And I was trying to get an update on, as you talk about the backlog of sales prospects, some of them have been in there, of course, for a protracted period of time during which there has been those discussions with administration. Trying to get a sense of how specific is the ROI data? And if it is as specific as I think youâve suggested that it is, that should sell the system to the administrator. The surgeons are already onboard and demanding the system apparently at certain facilities since theyâve gone to the Bioskill Labs.
So Iâm just trying to get a better understanding of where the sales process, I know there has been changes to the process, especially as related to administration, and thatâs why I guess Iâm focusing on what role and what specifically is happening with the ROI data. And why is it they donât react and say, the surgeons say we need it, the ROI data says, it pays for itself? Why doesnât it go forward?

Yes. Itâs a great question. There are some short answers to that. First of all, we have a very strong ROI and very attractive one and we share it with the administration. And each hospital has its own assumptions around the ROI. We have our model that we share and we let them review it and you can run in different ways, but it looks very attractive. The bottom line is that â if you ask me to get my subjective biased opinion, decisions in the hospitals and in big organizations are done in many different ways and take their time. Sometimes there are other considerations and many different priorities.
And itâs not necessarily a systematic rationale system that once you put something at one side will go to the other side with the answer you expect. There are many considerations, it takes time. I think that hospitals are looking at Mazor in a very favorable way, but their decision-making time is not always in line with our priorities. So itâs not about â oftentimes itâs not about, if we will buy, but when we will buy. And from that point of view, I think, weâre in a very good position and therefore, it keeps me very optimistic and positive about the opportunity to develop our pipeline.

The opportunity then for multi-systems and so forth. And within the major chains, I know there was an individual hired to focus on that aspect of the marketing initiatives, especially so I believe in the United States. Could you provide some update on that initiative, which has significant opportunities for multiple system sales, what can you share there?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. We definitely â youâre right. We did hire an executive to focus on the national accounts and the chains. And weâre doing very good progress there and weâre developing the relationships, it takes time, it takes time. But I expect this to be something very important in the market development for us. And we were very successful, both with Advantage Health Systems as well as with Tenent. And I expect these to be able to continue later with other chains, both for small hospitals as well as for the big hospitals.
