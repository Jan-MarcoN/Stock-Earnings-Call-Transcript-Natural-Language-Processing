Greetings, and welcome to the QEP Resources Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, William Kent, Director of Investor Relations for QEP Resources. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.
William I. Kent
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources third quarter 2014 results conference call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you haven't done so already, please go to our website, qepres.com, to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results and the slide presentation with maps and other supporting materials.
In today's conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck.
Charles B. Stanley
Thanks, Will, and good morning. I'd like to begin with a quick review of our progress on some key strategic initiatives, specifically the sale of our midstream business. I'll then touch briefly on some operational results for the quarter and finish with our plans for the remainder of 2014. Richard will then review our third quarter financial results as well as our guidance assumptions for the fourth quarter, before we move on to Q&A.
In mid-October, we announced the sale of our midstream business, including various interests in QEP Midstream Partners, LP, for $2.5 billion in cash.
This transaction, when complete, will allow us to maximize shareholder value by deploying proceeds from the sale through multiple avenues, including returning capital to shareholders, reducing debt and improving our competitive position through increased capital investment in our premier E&P assets.
You will recall that in January of this year, QEP's board authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, expiring in January of 2015.
This board authorization has been extended through the end of 2015, and a pricing committee has been established to execute open market share repurchases.
After closing the midstream sale, QEP will emerge as a more focused and financially strong independent E&P company, with assets in 2 of North America's most prolific crude oil provinces, the Williston and Permian Basins, and a low-cost high-quality natural gas property portfolio in the Rocky Mountains in Northwest Louisiana.
Richard will comment in a few moments on the impact of the pending sale, on the construct of our third quarter financial statements and on the income tax aspects of the transaction.
Operationally, the third quarter of 2014 was an exceptional quarter for QEP, as our strategy to transition to a more balanced and focused portfolio of E&P assets, with an emphasis on growing higher-margin crude oil and liquids-rich gas production, was exemplified by our excellent operating and financial results.
We set yet another quarterly company record of crude oil production of 4.7 million barrels, as our teams delivered strong operating results from our 2012 Williston Basin acquisition and our more recent Permian Basin acquisition.
This new record comes on the heels of strong crude oil production growth in the second quarter. Crude oil represented 35% of total natural gas equivalent production and greater than 63% of our field-level production revenue in the quarter compared to 20% and 51%, respectively, in the third quarter of last year.
We also delivered record EBITDA in the quarter despite sequential declines in both crude oil and NGL prices and the sale of our Midcontinent Cana-Woodford and Granite Wash properties. Those Midcontinent properties, by the way, represented over 10% of QEP Energy's production in the second quarter.
Looking back, 2014 has been a transformational year for our company. We've optimized our upstream portfolio through the acquisition of Permian Basin assets and the divesture of noncore gassy assets in the Midcontinent, and we're in the final steps of separating our midstream business.
We will be well positioned to thrive in the current uncertain commodity price environment going forward. And while successful completion of these transactions are huge accomplishments in and of themselves, we shouldn't lose sight of the strong performance of our core businesses during the quarter. Record EBITDA, thanks to record crude oil production, all driven by superb execution of our Williston and Permian Basin asset teams who delivered sequential quarterly average daily production increases of 29% and 18%, respectively.
Now let me give you a little more color on our operational results by area and some details on our plans for the remainder of the year. As I do so, you can refer to the slide presentation, which accompanied our release yesterday afternoon.
In Williston Basin, we currently have 7 rigs running, 5 on South Antelope and 2 on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.
Williston Basin net oil production averaged about 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter, comprised of about 93% liquids, and that's a 29% increase over the second quarter of 2014 and a 115% improvement over the third quarter of last year.
These better-than-forecasted results were driven by encouraging early performance from wells that we've completed with substantially larger total proppant volumes. We also had less downtime, and we also concentrated our drilling activity on our premier high-working-interest South Antelope properties.
QEP completed and turned to sales 28 gross-operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 82%. All of these wells were on South Antelope. We also participated in 27 gross outside-operated Bakken/Three Forks wells in the Williston Basin that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter. And in those wells, we had an average working interest of 9%.
In the fourth quarter, we plan to test, plug and perf completions at South Antelope, which in conjunction with increased stage count and larger proppant volumes will more than double the completion cycle time. And in addition to slowing the pace of new well delivery, the plug and perf completions will also increase the shut-in times, as we shut in offset wells while we do the plug and perf operations. And both of these things combined together will negatively impact total production volumes coming out of the Williston. As we evaluate the enhanced completions and optimum subsurface well spacing in South Antelope, some of our drilling activity is going to shift back to the Fort Berthold reservation, where we are drilling generally lower-working-interest wells that also tend to be less prolific than those on our premier South Antelope acreage.
As a result of these activities, you'll notice that we expect fourth quarter Williston Basin oil productions to decline slightly from our record third quarter levels, which should help explain our total crude oil production volume guidance for the fourth quarter.
Our Williston team continues to reduce drill times and set a new company record this quarter of 12.3 days from the start of drilling to a total depth of 20,080 feet. That beat our previous record of 13.8 days to a total depth of 21,199 feet that was set just a few days earlier. Our talented team has delivered this type of improvement in the past in other basins, and I'm not surprised by the rapid improvements we've made in the Williston, and I expect that they will continue to cut drill times even more.
Last quarter, we discussed plans to switch completion techniques in the Williston to larger frac sizes. Specifically, we've gone from 3 million pounds or 4 million pounds of proppant per well to pumping over 10 million pounds of sand.
I'm pleased to report that the initial results from these larger completions are living up to our expectations, with average uplifts in 90-day cumulative oil production on the order of 20% to 30%. We're also continuing to test down-spacing in the Williston, particularly at South Antelope. We will shortly commence drilling additional infill wells and expect initial production results from this new batch of infill wells late in the second quarter of next year. Once these wells are online, it will take another 90 to 120 days of production performance before we can draw meaningful conclusions about well interference and ultimate recovery.
I should stress that these are very important tests, as we're going to be drilling these wells at 400- to 600-foot spacing, and we'll also be testing the second bench of the Three Forks. Based on results from offset operators' pilot programs, we are encouraged about the potential of down-spacing to meaningfully increase the inventory of drilling locations in the Williston Basin. We plan to invest 51% of our capital budget in the Williston in 2014.
Slides 6 through 8 in the presentation provide additional details on our Williston Basin properties.
Turning to the Permian Basin. Daily production during the third quarter averaged 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, comprised of 78% liquids, making this the second straight quarter of greater than 15% sequential production growth.
In the third quarter, QEP Energy completed and turned to sales 21 vertical and 4 operated horizontal wells. The 4 operated horizontal wells, comprised of 2 Wolfcamp B and 2 Wolfcamp D completions, had an average maximum daily production rate of 846 Boe per day and a maximum average 30-day production rate of 624 Boe per day.
One of the Wolfcamp D wells was completed lower in the interval than we are currently targeting, and production results on that well are underperforming our expectations.
We continue to optimize both our completions design and also the artificial lift technology that we're employing, and we're seeing positive results from these changes that we've made. For example, one of our most recent horizontal completions, which is our lower Spraberry well, has already reached 1,249 barrels of oil equivalent a day, and that well is still cleaning up after less than 2 weeks online. And our vertical Atokaberry wells, by the way, are also performing in line to slightly better than expectations.
On the pricing front, although the Midland-Cushing basis differential widened significantly during the third quarter and negatively impacted our Permian Basin crude oil realization, the current differential has narrowed back down and is in the range of $4 to $6 a barrel.
At the end of the third quarter, QEP had 7 rigs running in the Permian Basin: 5 drilling vertical Atokaberry wells and 2 drilling horizontal wells in the Wolfcamp B and Spraberry Shale sections.
As a result of the encouraging horizontal well results, we continue to shift from vertical to horizontal rigs in the Permian. We added 1 horizontal rig right after the close of the quarter and released 1 vertical rig. And we plan to continue this shift, but we'll do it deliberately based on our choice of rigs, which may gate our short-term transition to horizontal development on our Permian assets.
We plan to invest about 19% of our capital budget in the Permian Basin in 2014 and that, of course, excludes the acquisitions.
Overall, we remain very pleased with the acquisition and our results from that property to date. And even in light of lower oil prices, we expect this acquisition will continue to generate strong returns.
You can refer to Slides 9 and 10 to see more details on our Permian Basin properties.
Turning to Pinedale. At the end of the third quarter, QEP had 4 operated rigs. Spud-to-total-depth drill times during the quarter averaged 10.7 days compared to an average of 12 days a year ago. We completed and turned to sales 38 gross Pinedale wells during the third quarter, including 2 wells for which QEP Energy is the operator, but in which we only have a small overriding royalty interest.
At the end of the third quarter, we had 31 gross Pinedale wells that were drilled and cased and waiting on completion, and those wells had an average working interest of 74%.
Our Pinedale net production averaged 287 million cubic feet a day of gas, comprised of about 25% liquids during the third quarter. As a reminder, we have been recovering ethane from Pinedale production throughout 2014, and we plan to recover ethane for the remainder of the year.
We expect to complete about 115 gross wells at Pinedale this year, including 10 wells in which we are the designated operator, but in which we only have a small overriding royalty interest.
While we continue to get more efficient at Pinedale, our capital budget is unchanged from our last quarter guidance, and we expect to invest about 17% of our total budget in Pinedale this year.
Slide 7 -- Slides 11 and 12 show the details of our activities at Pinedale.
Turning to the Uinta Basin. Net production averaged 74 million cubic feet a day, and that's comprised of about 34% liquids during the quarter, of which 29 million cubic feet a day was from the Lower Mesaverde play. QEP Energy has been recovering ethane in the Uinta Basin throughout 2014, and we also plan to continue in the fourth quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, we had 1 operated drilling rig working in the Lower Mesaverde play, 82 producing wells in the play and 1 well drilling and 1 well completing. At the end of the third quarter, we were drilling our fifth Lower Mesaverde horizontal well, and we continue to make improvements on drill times and completions designs. As we gather more production history from these wells, we're encouraged by the shallow production decline rate, which bodes well for estimated ultimate recoverable reserves.
As we've discussed previously, drilling horizontal wells in this formation is complicated and slow. We're making steady progress on improving drill times, and we continue to work diligently to unlock the value of this substantial asset.
Let me turn quickly to the Haynesville. While we don't have any operated drilling activity in the Haynesville currently, we have seen a large increase in outside-operated well proposals that we expect to generate good returns, so we've elected to participate in those wells. They generally directly offset our Haynesville acreage.
Our 2014 capital budget for the Haynesville is approximately $80 million, and that's unchanged from what we guided to last quarter. We expect this relatively modest investment will help stem some of the production decline that we've seen from our Haynesville asset. It won't completely offset the decline, but it will certainly slow it some. Most of the wells will be completed late this year, so we expect minimal impact on Haynesville completions and 2014 production volumes.
In summary, I'm very proud of our accomplishments so far in 2015. We've closed on multiple transactions and we've made substantial progress on our key strategic initiatives, all while delivering very solid results from our underlying business. I believe that QEP will be well positioned to grow liquids volumes in 2014 and beyond. And while we expect our natural gas production volumes to decline again this year, we believe that continued allocation to higher-return oil projects will lead to strong growth in oil production and in corresponding EBITDA.
As we look forward to the end of this year and into 2015, we're evaluating the impact of lower commodity prices on our business. Even at lower prices, our high-quality crude oil properties still generate acceptable returns. But obviously, lower prices will negatively impact cash flows, and therefore, could impact our broader investment plans. Given the recent steep decline in crude oil and the continued volatility in pricing, we continue to evaluate multiple scenarios for our 2015 capital program, and our primary focus is on limiting outspend to a sustainable level.
We've worked diligently in recent years to transform QEP into a focused and balanced E&P company with a deep portfolio of high-return investment opportunities, capable of delivering superior returns in a variety of market conditions. With substantial footprints in 2 premier U.S. oil plays and a deep inventory of low-cost liquids-rich gas projects, we're confident that our portfolio can continue to support multiple years of profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Richard.
Richard J. Doleshek
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. With Chuck having discussed our strategic and operating highlights for the quarter, I'd provide some color around our financial results before we go to Q&A.
Before I jump into the numbers, let me give you some background regarding the construct of our financial statements for the quarter. The pending sale of our midstream business has resulted in classifying that business as discontinued operations held for sale, which means that in our income statement presentation, all the individual line items that were associated with the midstream business that we are selling have been removed, and the total impact of those operations are reflected in the single line item labeled net income from discontinued operations net of income tax.
You will also see that, on the balance sheet, we have carved out the assets and liabilities associated with the midstream assets being sold and have grouped and labeled those respective items as discontinued assets for liabilities held for sale.
Finally, we have dropped any discussion of the results of those discontinued operations from the MD&A and the 10-Q. As an aside, we are not selling our Haynesville gathering system and have grouped those results into QEP marketing and other.
As Chuck mentioned, we generated $409.3 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which is a record for the company. That EBITDA level is especially impressive given that on June 30, 2014, we sold properties that generated $45 million of operating margin in the quarter.
The $409 million of EBITDA was $8.5 million higher than the second quarter of the year and $14.2 million higher than the third quarter of 2013.
QEP Energy generated $374 million or 91% of the aggregate third quarter EBITDA. And discontinued operations, which represents all of QEP Field Services excluding Haynesville gathering systems, contributed $38 million or about 9%.
QEP Energy's EBITDA was marginally higher in the second (sic) [third] quarter of 2014, driven by 6.5% higher realized prices, a 17% increase in oil volumes, offset by a 17% decrease in NGL volumes and a 14% decrease in natural gas volumes from the second quarter of the year's volumes.
The lower NGL and natural gas volumes are primarily the result of the sale of the Midcontinent properties at the end of the second quarter.
QEP Energy's third quarter production was 79.2 Bcfe. Oil volumes were 4.7 million barrels, up 690,000 barrels from the second quarter levels. The Permian Basin properties contributed 474,000 barrels of oil compared to 418,000 barrels in the second quarter.
Oil volumes in the Williston Basin were 3.7 million barrels, up 860,000 barrels; and gas volumes were 41.8 Bcf, a decrease of 6.8 Bcf. NGL volumes were 1.6 million barrels, down 322,000 barrels in the quarter.
With respect to production guidance for the year, we increased our volume forecast from the second quarter call across the board. Our forecast for full year volumes is 16.3 million to 16.5 million barrels, an increase from our previous guidance, driven by our continued success in the Williston and Permian Basins.
Our guidance for NGL volumes for the year is 6.6 million to 6.7 million barrels, assuming ethane recovery. And our forecast for natural gas volumes for the year is 175 to 178 Bcf, assuming that we are operating ethane recovery.
Our field-level prices were up about $0.15 per Mcfe for the quarter; and our realized prices, including the loss from our commodity derivatives portfolio were 70 -- sorry, $0.47 higher per Mcfe than in the second quarter.
I want to take a moment to discuss our realized oil prices versus WTI during the quarter and some of the factors that impact our realized prices and our expectations going forward.
Our average field-level oil price realization for the quarter was $84.21 a barrel, which reflects a differential that is a little bit wider than we have seen historically.
This was driven by 2 factors: First, the widening basis of Midland crude prices in the quarter that Chuck mentioned earlier; and second, the loss of oil volumes associated with the Midcontinent properties, which had historically received a price that was closer to WTI.
QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $136 million in the quarter, up from a $132 million in the second quarter, and that's from $109 million in the third quarter of 2013.
On a per-unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.77 per Mcfe and transportation expense was $0.95 per Mcfe or $1.72 per Mcfe for the 2 units -- 2 items combined.
We bumped up our guidance for lease operating and transportation expenses for the full year 2014 to $1.55 to $1.65 per Mcfe.
Sequential G&A expenses were down $15 million, primarily the result of the Midland field services G&A into discontinued operations.
We now expect reported G&A expenses to be approximately $175 million to $180 million for 2014, again excluding the field services component.
Production and property taxes were $59 million in the quarter or 9.6% of field-level revenue. This is higher than we had anticipated due to higher volumes in the Williston Basin, which has a higher average severance tax rate than the rest of our portfolio.
As a result of this mix, we are shifting our guidance for production and property tax to 9% to 10% of field-level revenue for the quarter.
We reported net income attributable to QEP of $171 million, including $17 million from discontinued operations. Included in net income are $164 million of unrealized gains on derivatives and a $12 million loss on asset sales, both of which are noncash items.
Excluding the unrealized loss and nonrecurring items, QEP reported net adjusted income of $75 million or $0.41 a share as compared to the First Call consensus of $0.25 per share.
Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures on an accrued basis for drilling and completion activities was $1.28 billion for the first 9 months of the year, which is in line with previous expectations. We are forecasting the midpoint of 2014 capital spending for E&P to be about $1.74 billion and about $15 million for corporate.
With regard to our balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, total assets were $10.3 billion, down $300 million sequentially, reflecting the Midcontinent asset sales. And total debt was $3.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $800 million from the previous quarter, reflecting the pay down of debt from proceeds from the Midcontinent asset sales as well as the sale of 40% of Green River Processing to the MLP, which closed on July 1.
Finally, I want to briefly cover the expected income tax impact from the midstream sale. While we ultimately believe that the tax leakage on the transaction will be about 16% of net sales proceeds, it will be a multiyear process to reach this number. At this point, we're expecting incremental cash taxes of approximately $500 million to be paid in 2015, offset by refunds from net operating losses generated by IDC expense over the next 2 years to ultimately reach that 16% figure.
Now before we go to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank Greg Bensen, our outgoing Director of Investor Relations, for his service over the last 2.5 years, a time that was both exciting and challenging and covered a period that was probably the most transformative in our company's brief history. Greg is moving to the technical side and will be working on our strategic initiatives and planning. Thank you, Greg.
Also, I want to introduce Will Kent, our new Director of Investor Relations. Will has been on the job less than a month and has already taken credit for our midstream deal.
Will is an experienced Investor Relations professional with over 10 years of IR experience, including a couple of years with a smaller E&P company. We threw him into the deep end of the pool, and he's hanging in there pretty well. Will has big shoes to fill, but we are confident that he will do a great job serving our stakeholders. Welcome to QEP, Will.
With that, we'll now take questions and answers.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Tameron from Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Can you talk about the use of proceeds as far as post the midstream? I mean, I know share buybacks have been out there, and you mentioned something about that in the press release. And there's been other speculation that you'll do some bolt-on acquisitions. Can you just give us how you're thinking about that right now?
Charles B. Stanley
Sure. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have a variety of avenues that we can go down with the use of proceeds. Obviously, one thing we will do is pay back some of our outstanding debt -- indebtedness, pay down our revolver, pay off our term loans, and then we'll have cash left on the balance sheet. The board did authorize the $500 million share repurchase. We formed a pricing committee. We'll be watching the market, both the equity market and the commodity price market, as we move forward and look at opportunities to opportunistically buy back shares. We are also mindful that we're running a commodity-dependent business and we don't control the price of the product that we're producing. And so we like being conservatively levered in this type of environment. And as I said, we continue to look at our capital investment levels for next year. And we've been -- and Jim Torgerson and his team are already exasperated with the number of different price scenarios I've had them run. And I've already thought of a couple more while I was listening to Richard give his part of the presentation. It's just -- it's a tough environment right now, Dave. And one of the things that we talked about in our recent board meeting is, is this a structural change in the oil price market -- in the oil markets or is it a correction. And I think it's too soon to tell. So we're going to go into the year -- next year, pretty cautious on capital spending. And obviously, we're going to look at opportunities across the portfolio to deploy capital, including share repurchases.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And let me just come back to the CapEx -- so -- or 2015 plans. How should we think about -- given any various commodity price decks, what everybody is going to run, how should we think about what your financial framework is for next year? I mean, do you want to stay within cash flow? Do you have debt levels that you want to achieve, debt metrics? Or can you give us anything on that?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we have to look at what's a sustainable level of outspend. What we're not going to do is blow out a bunch of capital drilling wells in a soft commodity tape, just for the sake of growing -- rapidly growing oil production. It just doesn't make sense to us. So we'll be looking at the market, and the other thing -- at the commodity market and making plans around a variety of different prices. The other thing that we were talking about last night, in fact, is that, as you know, service costs always lag the commodity price tape. And so in thinking about levels of capital investment, we also think we need to wait and watch and see what happens to service costs because they will respond. It just takes usually 5, 6, 7 months for them to do it.
Operator
Our next question today is coming from David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC
To kind of follow on David's comments, and you had a great second half, but it looks like for the year, third quarter is up but fourth quarter down. But as you think about activity levels to maintain the efficiency that you've gained in the Williston and the Permian, can you talk about that going into 2015 of not really maintenance capital, but really what's the efficient level of activity that you -- and then capital that is needed in those 2 oil basins?
Charles B. Stanley
Well, I think what I would call critical mass maybe is...
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC
Yes, that's a good way to put it.
Charles B. Stanley
Jim, I'll look to you. I mean, it's probably 4 or 5 rigs in each of those areas, and that gets you to the kind of critical mass that you need. We found that, David, over the years at Pinedale that there's a minimum level of drilling activity that you have to sustain in order to control a frac crew for a large portion of the year and keep that frac crew busy. And as you know, I mean, a large portion of the completed well cost is on the stimulation side. And the quality of the crew that you can attract is direct -- and retain is a direct reflection of how many wells they have to work on. So that sort of dictates the number of rigs. Now, it's -- as our teams have become more and more efficient, it becomes less a question of how many rigs you're running as to what your drill times are and how fast you can deliver a drilled and cased well. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, our drill times continue to come down in the Williston Basin as we learn more and more about drilling those wells. And I would say, we're further down on the learning curve in the Permian, but we'll come up the learning curve quickly there, too. And so it's really more a question of drilling efficiency and well delivery than it is absolute rig count. So it's sort of a -- it's a tough question to answer because it is a moving target. I think about the tremendous progress we've made just in the course of the year in the Williston, and I expect to see the same sort of efficiency gains as we get up the learning curve further in the Permian.
David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC
Okay. And then on that, can you help dissect the Williston drilling days versus completion days with the plug and perf? And how that impacts the -- we originally had kind of 20 to 25 wells in the fourth quarter as well, but it sounds like with the more plug and perf, that's down a little bit.
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. It's going to be down a bit, probably 20 wells or so in North Dakota. So that's 16 or so on the South Antelope property and 4 on the Fort Berthold reservation. And plug and perf does dramatically slow down the completion times. And as I mentioned, it will have an impact on offset wells. And because of the nature of the South Antelope property, it's good because it's all very compact and we don't have a lot of wasted time and motion with rig moves, but it also causes a significant amount of shut-ins when you're fracking offset wells. So -- but the plug and perf question is a good one, and we're doing it and we're doing it with similar proppant volumes and we're doing it in areas where we already have a lot of sliding sleeve data. We remain -- I'll just say, we remain skeptical that there's going to be a significant enough improvement in well performance with plug and perf versus sliding sleeve. We've looked at a lot of data. And it's tough to convince yourself that it's worth the extra cost and time, but we'll see.
Operator
Our next question today is coming from Tim Rezvan from Sterne Agee.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
I had a few real quick ones here just on -- based on some of Chuck's prepared comments. You talked about paying down the debt. You mentioned -- is that the $600 million term loan that you're discussing in addition to the revolver?
Richard J. Doleshek
Yes. Tim, we'll pay off the term loan. The carry on the term loan is about -- including the derivatives is about $2 million a month. So that's the right use of proceeds to pay that off.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. So you're thinking about $900 million for debt reduction off the bat, hopefully?
Richard J. Doleshek
Yes. It will probably be closer to $1 billion, as we sort of ramp up our spend in the second half of the year versus cash flow. So we're talking about $1 billion of revolver and term loan repayment with these proceeds.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. Okay, helpful. And then it sounds like the buybacks are pretty much on the table at any point. Is that fair to say now that the pricing committee is there that you guys will be -- in theory now that you've reported?
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. That's the key point that we're out of blackout on Monday. And then we'll be able to be in the market through the end of the year. And then obviously, once we start to know the fourth quarter results in early January, we will be blacked out again until we report.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. Okay, that's helpful. On the Oklahoma asset sales. I guess, the SCOOP package is still on the market. Do you have any update on that?
Charles B. Stanley
No, it actually -- we signed the PSA last Friday and -- actually 2 PSAs for the same property with 2 separate buyers. And it should close, and I'm going to knock on wood, by the end of the year, early next year, probably late December.
Richard J. Doleshek
Tim, we reported proceeds of about $108 million -- expected proceeds of about $108 million before adjustments. Against the book basis, that's about $37 million, $38 million.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. I know you had multiple packages out there. I didn't know that was the SCOOP piece.
Charles B. Stanley
And Tim. Just to clarify, because I read a report from -- it wasn't from you, but one of your colleagues in the sell-side world that this was our last asset in the Midcontinent. It is not. We still have another portfolio of assets sitting out there, some in the Arkoma Basin and then scattered assets in the Anadarko Basin, with net production of 12 million or 15 million cubic feet equivalent a day that are not sold yet and will be marketed early next year.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. I thought that's what you had sold, okay. Thank you for clearing that up.
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. I think the -- what was the production on the SCOOP, about 9 million cubic feet equivalent?
Richard J. Doleshek
About 8 million.
Charles B. Stanley
8 million or 9 million.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then you made mention in the release about doing some vertical Green River wells. It sounds a little more exploratory in nature. Are you kind of chasing maybe what Ultra has found on their vertical program out there?
Charles B. Stanley
If you look at our map, you'll notice that our acreage is immediately adjacent to Ultra's. And we've drilled 3 new-drill Green River wells. We've completed them. And I think the average depth of those wells is about 7,500 feet or so. We've completed a 1,000 foot to 1,200 foot interval, and it's a stacked sequence of shale, sand, limestone. And we've frac-ed that all and co-mingled it. And the results are interesting. And yes, it is a lateral extension to the acreage that Ultra is working on to the west. We call our area Pelican Lake. And so in addition to those 3 wells, we've also done some re-completions. We have some old Wasatch formation gas wells, vertical wells that have been drilled in the Wasatch back in the early 2000s. We re-completed a handful of those wells. I think it's a total of 8 wells in that same interval. And we're watching those wells to get some production performance, but the early results look quite encouraging. Just a reminder, we produce about 2,700, 2,800 barrels a day of black wax in the Uinta Basin from the legacy Red Wash and Wonsits Valley fields that we acquired back in 2001.
And this interval is not the conventional pay interval that has produced at Red Wash and Wonsits Valley. It's in an interval of very -- a truly unconventional looking pay, stuff that you wouldn't really -- it doesn't jump out at you on the logs.
Timothy Rezvan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then I have one last one and I'll step off. You mentioned the down-spacing testing you're going to be doing in addition to the lower Three Forks. Is there any way to frame best case, worse case, what you think that could do to your remaining inventory in the Bakken? I'll leave it at that.
Charles B. Stanley
Worse case, it doesn't add anything. But best case is that it doubles our inventory roughly. It may even more than double it to the extent that we get commercial wells in the second bench of the Three Forks formation that we'll add. We don't count any inventory below the first bench of the Three Forks currently. So the second bench tests that have been done offsetting our acreage are quite interesting and encouraging. And that's why we're drilling one ourselves, and it may add additional inventory that we don't even recognize in our probable reserves.

Our next question today is coming from Brian Corales from Howard Weil.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
I want to talk about the Permian. You have 5 vertical rigs running. And I think Chuck, you said you're going to go more horizontal. Can you kind of talk towards that, kind of the development and the plans going forward on the horizontal?
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. I was stumbling through my prepared remarks. But just to point out, we've already dropped another vertical rig and substituted a horizontal, and we'll continue to do that. Look, the horizontal wells generate better returns than the vertical wells do. We need to drill some vertical wells to: a, validate the geology and allow us to collect more geologic data; but b, we also need to save some of the deeper leases -- the deeper section on some of our leases because the earlier owner of this property stopped short of drilling all the way through the pay interval, and so we need to salvage production in the deeper horizons in order to save those leases. So nominally, we probably need 1 rig running -- 1 vertical rig running in order to do that next year, and we'll shift away from vertical development to horizontal development very quickly to do that. So does that help you?
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
No, that's helpful. That's helpful. And I've got 2 more quick ones. The Bakken cost for these enhanced -- like the plug and perf, do you have a number for that?
Charles B. Stanley
Jim?
Jim E. Torgerson
It's -- to do a plug and perf, it's an extra $1 million, so given the same number of stages. We've actually done 48 stages with sliding sleeves. So to do a 48- or 50-stager with the plug and perf is about $1 million extra.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And then, Chuck, another company was talking about refracs in the Haynesville. Have you all seen or participated in anything like that?
Charles B. Stanley
We are seeing some from afar. The one that I'm aware of that our guys have some data on was a well that was in a very good area of the Haynesville. It was offsetting our Thorn Lake area, which is sort of in our southern and western acreage, if you look at the Haynesville map. And that well -- the original well that was drilled was, how should I say, poorly completed. It was under-stimulated. And so the refrac basically got the proppant volume up to what was state-of-the-art at the time. And it certainly improved the production of the well, but it was in an area where the rock was good and the initial well was not good, so you would have expected that improvement just by restimulating it. Does that make sense?
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Yes. No, understood. I just hadn't heard that before. I figured you guys have better info.
Charles B. Stanley
And I don't -- we certainly -- we've been talking a lot about it. One of the challenges is you've got a 4,000 foot roughly lateral with holes poked in it all the way from the heel to the toe. And diverting the proppant and getting a good even restimulation across that lateral is a tough challenge. Mechanically, it's difficult to do without, basically, just cementing off all the perfs and starting over again, which is -- would be prohibitively expensive, I think.

Our next question today is coming from Andrew Coleman from Raymond James.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
I guess, how much of your service contracts right now, I guess, are locked in on long-term agreements versus you have flexibility pricing-wise to stay lower?
Charles B. Stanley
We have a lot of flexibility. None of our stimulation services are contracted. And our rig fleet, we've got 4 or 5 rigs that have contracts that run into next year, most of them are shorter duration.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And as you think -- if oil prices do start to tick back up, I guess, at what point -- I guess, assume you'd rank the plays as probably Bakken, Permian and Uinta. I mean, what price would Uinta start to compete more favorably with those other 2 areas?
Charles B. Stanley
I think -- are you speaking specifically of the oil? Or...
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Yes.
Charles B. Stanley
I think it's too soon to tell, Andrew, because we just don't have enough production history on these wells. There's a couple of issues with the Uinta: a, there's early life on these new drills and recompletes; and b, the Uinta suffers from a chronic basis differential because of a captive refining market, which is really the only efficient market that you can get to, short of substantial infrastructure investment to load crude out of the basin by rail. So we need to do more work on the technical side first. We do have pipeline capacity in the Uinta Basin through our legacy relationship with Chevron, who owned the properties that we bought. But it is a more difficult place to generate returns.
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then, I guess, as Greg has kind of moved over to a new spot there, I guess, when you think about allocating capital to 2015, can you give a sense of what the strategic option sort of bucket looks like in terms of the overall spend profile?
Charles B. Stanley
Is that a question for Greg?
Andrew Coleman - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
That's a question for kind of -- it's been 4 years and you guys have gotten through the -- the transformation is complete. But I guess, we'll start working on the next transformation.
Charles B. Stanley
Well, I think we deliberately diversified the portfolio 4 years ago. We were mostly a gas company. Today, we -- over half of our field-level revenue is coming from crude oil. And we have some really great properties, where I think we have an opportunity to continue to invest in the Williston and in the Permian. And as I said, I'm encouraged by the early results in the Uinta. I just think it's too early to pound the table on it yet. So we have ample investment opportunities in our portfolio to redeploy cash on a go-forward basis.
Operator
Our next question today is coming from Brian Gamble from Simmons.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
I wanted to touch on a couple of things. The Permian, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Chuck, that lower Spraberry well. It's a great rate, especially if it's still going up, as you clean out kind of offsetting maybe that weaker Wolfcamp D well. How far down did that Wolfcamp D pull the average for the other horizontals that you completed for the quarter?
Charles B. Stanley
It probably pulled it down, I don't know, 20% or so. I guess, one of the things I should point out, I made 2 comments. One that we continue to work on our well design. We've seen a very strong correlation between the amount of proppant that we're pumping per foot. And the early wells that we drilled were lower concentration. The most recent one, the Spraberry well that I mentioned, is about 2,000 pounds per foot. And they're just like -- it seems like everywhere that we look, we see the same high correlation coefficient between increased proppant loading and better well performance. And this is -- the Permian is no different. So we're moving to much higher proppant concentrations going forward on all of our wells, a; and b, our early well performance on these first handful of wells that we put online has been negatively impacted by our choice of artificial lift. We thought that we could use gas lift on these wells, and it has not worked. It has not worked as well as we had hoped it would. And so the most recent completions have been lifted with ESPs, and that has made a dramatic improvement in the early life production performance. I also think it helps getting the frac water back off the formation quickly. So that's -- those 2 things have conspired, I think, to present early well performance that's not up to snuff, and we recognize that. We're working on addressing the 2 issues: one being the size of the frac jobs, and placement. That 1 Wolfcamp D well was drilled low in the section, and it was a lower proppant volume as well, in an attempt to try to evaluate the deeper part of the cline or the lower Wolfcamp. And it just didn't -- it didn't work out. And so we learned a very valuable lesson there. We won't do that again.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
That's great color. And then you mentioned a couple of times not quite sure what '15 is going to do from the oil price standpoint, structural or not, it's still a question. But you also mentioned wanting to limit the outspend to an acceptable level. I know you've got a lot of cash, a lot of moving pieces from a finance side of things. But how do you define that? I mean, are we looking at debt metrics at the end of '15 after you've done everything you want to do on the balance sheet? Or how do we best think about where that plan for '15 could shake out?
Richard J. Doleshek
Brian, it's Richard. The debt metrics really for next year, with the amount of cash we're going to have -- I mean, if you think about having paid off all the bank debt and having the $2.2 billion of senior notes, we'll have about $1.25 billion of cash, day 1. So that's $1 billion of net debt versus $1.5 billion of EBITDA kind of number. I mean, a sub-1x debt multiple of EBITDA, it just doesn't -- I think that the debt metrics aren't really what's going to drive how much we decide to spend in terms of capital mix relative to EBITDA. I think it's really the return on the projects. Although next year is the year if you want to outspend a little bit. Because of the amount of cash you have raised, you could do it. But I think it's really driven by rates of return and what the outlook for commodity prices is versus let's fixate on a debt level or an overspend level.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
So what do you guys plan on using in your budgets? Can you share that?
Charles B. Stanley
For commodity prices?
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Yes, sir.
Charles B. Stanley
A variety of different prices. I mean, we run prices as low as $75 and $3.50. I'm not sure if that's low enough. And that's why I said I was sitting here this morning, I started thinking of lower prices. And I was -- we need to be prepared for a sustained period of lower oil prices and how will we respond to that. And as I said, I think that cost will move in, in response to lower prices. But it's not going to be instantaneous. So at least during the early period, just managing with that knowledge, so that we don't embed a bunch of high costs into our program in a period where commodity prices are going to stay lower is part of the objective. It's not an easy exercise, as Mr. Torgerson will tell you. His hair is getting grayer. It hasn't started falling out yet, but -- or at least not that I know of. So we will run a variety of prices. And our board has asked us to be very thoughtful about our capital investment program given the uncertainty around commodity prices.

Our final question today is coming from Michael Rowe from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
I guess, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the down-spacing in the Williston. You highlighted that it's going to add quite a bit to your inventory depth [ph] there. What's -- I was wondering if any are -- are there any logistical or operational challenges associated with doing tighter spacing? And do you expect that could impact just the cycle time in terms of bringing wells to sales?
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. Michael, I think the biggest challenge is that as we go back into this field, where we've already drilled it up on tighter -- on loose spacing and we started drilling on tighter spacing, we're going to have a significant amount of offset well production impact from shut-ins as we frac the infill wells. That's probably the biggest logistical challenge because it's just physically impossible to avoid hitting those wells. And so you need to shut them in, let the pressure buildup on them some to avoid or minimize the impact on the well going forward. But it will require longer and larger shut-ins as we infill. Other -- surface, topside stuff, not -- we'll have to probably expand pads or build new pads. But it's not that bad. We're in -- topography, at least in South Antelope, is not a big issue. There's not a lot of surface challenges as far as building additional surface infrastructure. So that's not as big a challenge.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, maybe just switching to the Permian real quick. You highlighted that you had a kind of couple of wells, maybe 1 well that was underperforming with expectations. But you still -- estimates overall are in line with what you kind of thought when you made this acquisition. Do you care to provide any color on exactly what sorts of well economics or EURs that you underwrote when you made this deal?
Charles B. Stanley
Yes. I don't have the details in front of me. But we have -- we basically evaluated 3 zones, and we had EURs in the sort of 0.5 million to 0.75 million barrel equivalent range, depending on zone. And that -- the production performance of the wells we've drilled to date continues to validate our acquisition economics.
Operator
We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.
