Hello, and welcome to today's webcast. My name is Kaylene, and I will be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions]
It's now my pleasure to turn the webcast over to Karl Deonanan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Deonanan, the floor is yours.
Karl Deonanan
Thank you, Kaylene. Good morning, and welcome to Quintiles' Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me this morning are Tom Pike, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Gordon, our Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to our press release issued this morning, a conference call presentation corresponding to our prepared remarks is available on our website at www.quintiles.com/investors.
Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, which are discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's 2013 annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2014, and the 2014 annual report on Form 10-K, which we plan to file later today.
In addition, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which should be considered a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the press release and conference call presentation.
I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Pike.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Karl, and good morning to everyone and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call.
We're pleased with both the fourth quarter results and our full year 2014 achievements. Let's begin on Slide 3 with a few highlights. Net new business was strong in the fourth quarter, generating 22.2% year-over-year growth and a 1.49x book-to-bill ratio. We delivered 9.3% constant currency service revenue growth during the quarter, with IHS contributing 33% constant currency growth and Product Development contributing 2.3% growth. We continued to execute against our productivity programs, which contributed to the expansion of our adjusted income from operations margin by 250 basis points during the quarter. And we finished the fourth quarter with strong diluted adjusted earnings per share growth of 29.1%, a solid fourth quarter, which contributed to our strong full year results.
Some highlights of the full year are: constant currency service growth of 10.1%, approximately $4.2 billion of services revenues and the incremental $383 million over 2013. Our IHS segment, that's Integrated Healthcare Services, returned to growth, with the service revenue growth of 22.5% at constant currency compared to 2013 for the full year.
We expanded our full year adjusted income from operations margin by 120 basis points by utilizing our global delivery network and leveraging our SG&A while continuing to focus on quality. We also delivered 33.9% growth in adjusted net income, 31.1% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and 14.5% growth in free cash flow. These are strong metrics. On the net new business front, we recorded $5.6 billion, representing 14.4% growth for the full year of 2014. We finished the year with our highest book-to-bill ratio in the past 6 years of 1.34 and included 11 accounts with more than $100 million of net new business for the year.
During the fourth quarter in Product Development, we booked net new business totaling $1.23 billion, representing 28% growth compared to the same period last year. The book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was a strong 1.59x services revenue.
For the full year in Product Development, we booked $4.37 billion of net new business, 16% growth, despite experiencing some increased cancellations compared to the prior year, primarily in the second and fourth quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for the year finished at 1.41, which is our highest in the past 6 years.
During the course of the year, we've discussed some varying dynamics in our net new business and book-to-bill for Product Development. We saw a solid pipeline of opportunities. We won a number of big important deals due to our technology, our expertise and our globality. At the same time, we absorbed some cancellations and had some large multi-year renewals. We're very pleased with our net new business performance in the Product Development segment 2014. Our 1.41 book-to-bill contributed to a great foundation of backlog.
In the IHS segment during the fourth quarter, we booked net new business of $354 million, representing 6% growth compared to the same period last year, translating into a book-to-bill of 1.22. For the full year 2014, we booked $1.23 billion, representing 9% growth and a book-to-bill of 1.15, which is higher than our 5-year historical average of 1.1 in that segment.
Our bookings included a very strong mix of real-world, late phase studies. I'm also pleased with this number. As you know, the bookings in the segment will be lumpier, but we're making real progress.
In summary, we had a strong sales year, driven by proactive demand generation, our deep customer relationships, our ability to deliver innovative solutions that increase our customers' probability of success.
Now let me hand it over to Kevin, who will provide some greater detail on the financial results.
Kevin K. Gordon
Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Taking a look at Slide 4, let's begin with the consolidated results. For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, our consolidated service revenues grew 9.3% at constant currency compared to the prior year. At actual foreign exchange rates, our service revenues grew 6% to nearly $1.1 billion in the quarter, including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $33.4 million. For the year, our constant currency revenue growth was 10.1% compared to the same period in 2013. At actual foreign exchange rates, our service revenues grew 9.4% to $4.2 billion, including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $25.7 million.
The global mix of our service revenues shifted slightly from the prior year as a result of the strong IHS North America, Encore and Novella revenue contributions, with the North America and Latin America region up slightly to 43% of revenues; Europe, Middle East and Africa region down slightly to 36%; and the Asia Pacific region steady at 21% of the total consolidated revenues.
During the fourth quarter, adjusted income from operations grew 27.1% to $164.2 million, a margin of 15.4%, with 250 basis points of margin expansion comprised of 90 basis points from positive foreign currency exchange and 160 basis points from reductions in SG&A costs relative to revenues, offset by an increase in IHS service revenue mix compared to the prior year. For the full year, adjusted income from operations was $599.4 million, representing growth of 18.9%. The income from operations margin for the full year was 14.4%, representing 120 basis points of margin expansion comprised of 60-basis-point benefit from foreign exchange and 60 basis points from increased operational productivity and greater SG&A leverage, offset by service revenue mix with stronger revenue growth in the IHS segment.
For the fourth quarter, adjusted SG&A of $225.1 million was 21.2% of service revenues compared to $232.8 million or 23.2% of service revenues in the prior year. The current year quarter included increased costs associated with Encore, offset by onetime costs in the same period last year. For the full year 2014, adjusted SG&A of $882.3 million was 21.2% of service revenues compared to $832.8 million or 21.9% of service revenues in the prior year. The dollar increase was primarily due to the Novella and Encore acquisitions and increases in share-based compensation expense, offset by our continued focus to leverage our SG&A infrastructure as well as prior year nonrecurring costs incurred at the time of the IPO.
The GAAP effective income tax rate was 29.4% during the quarter compared to 27.5% for the same period last year and 29.9% compared to 29.7% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the rate during the quarter was primarily due to a higher proportion of profit in the United States compared to the prior year and higher deferred income taxes on foreign earnings.
Adjusted net income grew 25.8% to $91.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. And for the full year, adjusted net income was $353.4 million, representing growth of 33.9%. Contributing to the full year growth were the increased service revenues, improved operating margins in both segments, $22.4 million of reduced net interest expense from lower interest rates and reduced debt levels for the majority of the year compared to 2013, a $5 million gain from the sale of marketable securities in the first quarter and a $5.5 million more of net earnings from unconsolidated affiliates compared to 2013.
Diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 29.1% to $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $0.55 per share in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 31.1% to $2.70 per share compared to $2.06 per share in 2013.
We recognized $5.2 million of net restructuring charges during the fourth quarter and $9 million for the year in connection with the approved restructuring plans. We expect to continue our productivity and SG&A initiatives to further improve our global cost structure and delivery model during 2015, which will require additional restructuring costs.
Our cash balance was $867 million as of the end of the year, of which $211 million was in the United States. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $432 million and $349 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $393 million and $305 million, respectively, for the same period in 2013. The increases in operating and free cash flow reflect the increase in net income and lower interest payments of $21.6 million, offset by a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding of $21.1 million compared to 2013 and increased income tax payments.
Capital expenditures were $82.7 million for the year or 2% of service revenues compared to $88.3 million during the same period in 2013.
During the fourth quarter, the company repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock from shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. The repurchase was initially funded with a combination of cash on hand and $150 million draw on our revolving credit facility. This repurchase was separate from the previously announced repurchase program, which has $59.5 million of authorization remaining.
We also amended our senior secured credit agreement in the fourth quarter to increase our revolving credit facility from $300 million to $400 million and extended the maturity date by 6 months and executed the 4-year arrangement to securitize certain of our accounts receivables, which was comprised of a $275 million term loan and a $25 million revolving loan commitment at a rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points.
The net proceeds from the low-cost term loan under the securitization facility were used to repay the drawdown on the revolving credit facility for the share repurchases in the fourth quarter, to repay $25 million of the senior secured term loan under the credit agreement, to pay related fees and expenses, and the remainder is to be used for general corporate purposes. With these corporate borrowings, our net debt outstanding, defined as total debt and capital lease obligations less cash and equivalents at December 31, 2014, was $1.43 billion compared to $1.27 billion at the end of December 2013.
Please turn to Slide 5 for a look at our 2 operating segments. For the full year 2014, our Product Development segment accounted for 74% of our service revenues, while the IHS segment accounted for 26%, a 300-basis-point greater contribution from IHS compared to 2013 due to the stronger revenue growth in this segment.
Product Development's constant currency revenue growth was 2.3% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. At actual foreign exchange rates, Product Development service revenues were flat at $774.4 million, including $18.6 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact compared to the same period in the prior year.
The lower growth rate in Product Development was expected, due to an approximate 420-basis-point headwind from the conclusion of the large clinical project from last year, adding to an already difficult prior year comp, a change in service mix of net new business booked during the year, which negatively impacted the historical revenue burn profile and a negative impact of cancellations from the second quarter of 2014 and timing of start-up on certain projects.
For the year, Product Development's constant currency revenue grew 6.3% in an actual foreign exchange rate of 6.1% to $3.1 billion, which included a negative impact from foreign exchange of $5.1 million, a 440-basis-point revenue headwind from the conclusion of the large clinical project last year and the negative impact from cancellations.
Product Development income from operations for the quarter was $168 million, 5.6% growth at constant currency and 9.9% at actual rates. Product Development income from operations margin was 21.7% in the quarter, representing an improvement of 200 basis points compared to the same period last year, including 70 basis points from improved SG&A leverage from our global overhead programs and 130 basis points from foreign currency benefits.
For the year, Product Development's constant currency income from operations growth was 9.9% and 14.8% at actual foreign exchange rates, increasing to $645.2 million, including positive foreign exchange benefit of $27.3 million. The income from operations margin for the year finished at 20.8%, representing 150 basis points of margin improvement, including 90 basis points from favorable currency fluctuations and 60 basis points from the increased productivity and increased SG&A leverage from our global overhead programs.
IHS service revenues grew 33% at constant currency rates in the fourth quarter. At actual foreign exchange rates, revenues were $289.6 million, representing an increase of 26.5% or $60.7 million compared to the same period last year, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $14.8 million. For the year, IHS's constant currency revenue grew 22.5% and at actual foreign exchange rates 20.2% to nearly $1.1 billion, including a negative exchange rate of $20.6 million.
The increase in service revenues for the quarter in the IHS segment were from commercial North America on the recent strong bookings, a continuation of a very strong growth in our real-world and late phase research unit and $16.2 million from the Encore acquisition. IHS income from operations for the quarter was $24.3 million, 107.2% growth at actual rates and 119.5% at constant currency rates compared to the same period in 2013. The income from operations margin for the quarter was 8.4% at both the actual and constant currency. Margins improved 330 basis points, of which 230 basis points came from a mix change to higher-margin, real-world and late phase studies, including end of project reconciliations and modifications and 100 basis points from increased SG&A leverage.
For the year, IHS income from operations was $64.8 million, including unfavorable foreign exchange of $4.8 million. IHS income from operations grew 53.8% at actual foreign exchange rates and 65.1% at constant currency rates. The income from operations margin for the year finished at 6.1% at actual rates and 6.4% at constant currency rates.
Margins improved 140 basis points, primarily from SG&A leverage, offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Clearly, solid performance in both of our segments.
Now turning to our 2015 guidance. With the strong net new business recorded in both segments, we entered 2015 with $11.24 billion of backlog. We expect to recognize approximately $3.7 billion of this backlog as revenue in 2015. And with our current view of the new opportunity pipeline, we expect to achieve constant currency service revenue growth of 7.5% to 9%.
We expect revenue growth compared to each respective 2014 quarter to accelerate as we progress through the year, as the product development projects booked in the second half of 2014 begin to recruit patients as they transition to the recruitment phase and start-up.
We expect our service revenues to be impacted by an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind of approximately 420 basis points, assuming rates as of the beginning of this year. We expect to achieve diluted adjusted earnings per share between $3.02 and $3.13 per share, representing growth of 12% to 16%, and diluted GAAP earnings per share between $2.90 and $3.04 per share. We expect the annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 29.5%.
Our guidance does assume foreign currency rates in effect at the beginning of 2015, but does not reflect the potential impact of future equity repurchases, if any. We are looking for 2015 to be another strong year for Quintiles.
I will now turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas H. Pike
Thank you, Kevin. Kevin has given you a little bit more detail on the quarter and the year. Let me add a little bit of context from my vantage point, then we'll get to your questions.
It was a very good year for Quintiles. We created value for our investors with strong new business, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. We solidified our leadership position in the industry with additional sole-source arrangements, some large multi-year contracts and growth in our Integrated Healthcare Services segment. And this segment is one that creates value for our customers and shareholders and also differentiates us from the traditional CROs.
We're also a job creator, with thousands joining us, balanced around the world between the Americas, Europe and Asia. We continue to believe the market for our services is strong and growing. There were 41 novel drugs approved last year in the U.S., and the EMA recommended 81. The importance of advances of -- in the science of our industry is evidenced by the Obama administration's push on precision medicine. Emerging biopharma funding was up 46% for the year, with a particularly strong Q4.
Our sales growth was impressive this year. We recorded $5.6 billion, representing 14.4% growth for the full year of 2014. Our 2014 book-to-bill of 1.34 is well above our historical market-leading average of 1.23.
Our 2014 sales growth indicates the strength and scale of our position in the industry. We're relied on for larger deals and can do sole-source for mid-sized and other pharma companies like no one else, given our deep expertise. In fact, our sole-source deals are really just starting to pay dividends, as we only put projects into backlog when we get project-specific, noncontingent written commitments from our customers.
We also had a strong year with small and emerging biopharma. Regarding revenue growth, we're pleased with the evolution of our IHS segment this year. It became a real contributor to growth this year. We see more cross-segment synergies emerging, given the payer situation, as well as regulatory interest in real-world information.
In Product Development, revenue growth for the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of things, including FX, as Kevin described. We're charging hard to maximize those elements of the clinical trials that are in our control. We had a fourth quarter Product Development that was strong in terms of net new business. And while start-ups and contracts have extended a little longer than we would like, the number of new contracts entering start-up bodes well for the second half of 2015.
At the same time, I'm really pleased with our progress of margin improvement programs. Our executives are implementing better, more efficient delivery models in Product Development and IHS as well as in SG&A, and it's producing better results for our customers and for us. We have both the deepest expertise and the best delivery model, a winning combination for customers and investors.
In addition to our strong financial performance this year, we received some significant recognition, which included being named to the Fortune 500; winning the Best Contract Research Organization at the SCRIP Awards, our fourth award in this category in the last 5 years; Asia Pacific CRO of the Year by Frost & Sullivan for the sixth time in 8 years; and once again, being named to the CIO 100 for the Quintiles technology Infosario platform.
In closing, our accomplishments during 2014 had made us stronger and better positioned to maintain our leadership in the industry while supporting the evolving needs of our customers. We are confident our strategy is the right strategy, and we'll continue to execute to drive results and maintain our leadership.
I'd like to recognize and thank the entire Quintiles team, now over 32,000 strong, for their innovation, their hard work and their commitment during the year. And let me turn the call back over to Karl to begin the question-and-answer.
Karl Deonanan
Thanks, Tom. We are ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Kaylene, you may now open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Bailin.
Jeffrey Bailin - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
Tom, this is the second quarter in a row of really exceptional book-to-bills in the Product Development segment. First of all, can you comment if there was anything in terms of the significant renewal or maybe more onetime in that figure for this quarter? Is there any additional color you can offer around the work being won, whether by customer type, type of relationship or geographic distribution?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, let me start with the second part. Now the customer wins this quarter were really quite wide in terms of the expense around the world and across the customer base. So what we are seeing, consistent with the increased funding for small biotech, is an increased win rate and an increased contribution from small biotech. So we've seen, for instance, as a percentage of the total wins that go up by several percent this quarter. Now in addition, we do continue to see big wins from large customers, though. And during the course of the year, we've mentioned some numbers, but this was a strong year for us in terms of more than $100 million of bookings by many customers. And so very significant year. We did see -- and Kevin and I talked about this a little bit. This year, this past year, 2014, was a little bit of a year of renewals. And it's very important as a company that we demonstrate our ability to continue a business that we've had with customers over the last few years as well as win new projects. And we're really pleased that we won a number of renewals. There was a chunk of renewals in this quarter, but what I can assure you, and Kevin can probably give more color on, if he'd like, is that we've had a really strong quarter in terms of what we would call project-based revenue wins. And so we feel really good about that.
Kevin K. Gordon
And, Jeff, I would add. I think in both segments, it was a very strong quarter in terms of gross new bookings across really the service offering, whether you put that into our commercial -- I would say, the particular strength in our commercial business within IHS is -- in North America has been incredibly strong for us in that area. The real-world, late phase, you've heard us mention now on several calls consecutively the strength of that business. That continues to be very strong. Going into the Product Development side, in particular, it was a good quarter for us in terms of what we would call our core clinical business in terms of the integrated service offering with very strong bookings. And you heard us mention in the remarks it actually included some cancellations that went the other way, which is important to note because we'll start up as we go through 2015. Our new bookings will start up more in the second half of the year, and some of those cancellations may have a more near-term impact in the first half. But in general, in both segments, I would say, on a gross new business, new booking basis, we're at levels that were as high as any quarters in the last 8 quarters, so really strong.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just in -- Kevin, to start with you, just in terms of the tax rate and the opportunity to sort of bring that down over time. I mean, I know if we look across the CRO industry, historically, there's been sort of a pretty significant range in terms of the effective tax rate paid by the companies, and that's somewhat respective of where they're doing work. But just -- when I look at your business mix, I do think I see some opportunity to bring that down over time, and I was just curious to hear your perspective.
Kevin K. Gordon
Doug, I think there's opportunities to do that. I think the -- you heard in the remarks that we've actually seen a great deal more demand, particularly in the U.S. market in terms of some of the mix of where our profitability has been. And as a result of that, that had an impact on the tax rate. But we're at 29.5 percentage range for our guidance. I think we've consistently indicated we see the opportunity over time to push that down some, but we're obviously balancing that rate as well as we can and looking at the cash flow and looking at strategies to make sure we maximize both.
Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Okay. And then maybe, Tom, if you could provide for some commentary in terms of what you're seeing in the sales team business as part of IHS. You've obviously talked about the demand for late -- for these sort of late phase services.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes. I think Kevin touched on this a little bit. I -- in general, this whole push that we have associated with more value-based approaches to payers is doing a combination of things to us. It's causing us to be able to provide more solutions for our customers. So they're interested not only in the commercial sales force, but they're also interested in our consultative solutions and our ability to provide market access, information and things, as well as the number of approvals is continuing, particularly in North America, to create opportunities for us to provide a variable sales force. So Kevin mentioned that strength, and we see them in particularly in North America. And frankly, it has to do with the FDA support for innovative drug development approvals in this country. I do think it's interesting. The U.S. comment that Kevin made, it's really -- we have a tremendous amount of business in the oncology area. And when you have business in that area, in -- especially in the Phase II trials, they'll have a tendency to be more U.S.-based. And it's driving a little bit of a mix change, which -- in terms of where some of the trials are conducted. But the good news, I think, for you as investors, if you look at the mix we have, a hot area like oncology, that area is reflected in our wins and in our mix as we move forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell.
Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
I just wanted to come back to IHS a little bit on the operating margin side. Very strong in the quarter, and we were of the impression that maybe there would be a seasonal downtick Q-over-Q. But regardless, great results. I'm just curious if being at 8.5% going into '15, if that changes your long-term trajectory and where you think margin in that segment may wind up. As well as how do we think about phasing of margin in IHS as we progress through the year?
Kevin K. Gordon
Eric, it was a really strong quarter. We've continued to see this -- the revenue service mix in our favor as we've seen the growth, particularly in the real-world, late phase. It contributed nicely in the quarter and as you can probably tell, somewhat exceeded our expectations from a margin perspective based on our comments on the third quarter. So it was a good, very strong quarter. It did include some, what we call, end-of-project reconciliations and modifications, which were positive and contributed, so a really good quarter. And then as we continue to ramp up that revenue, we're leveraging the SG&A and taking advantage of that. So that was a nice contribution to the fourth quarter. I don't know that it's changed significantly, our long-term view. I think we've consistently indicated that segment's margins are likely to go up into the high single digits over the next couple of years. We did have a really strong fourth quarter in our guidance as we think about 2015. And we expect they'll likely moderate out over the course of the year, pretty close to where we were this year or slightly up from this year. And to your question around how do we see that progressing through the year, naturally, the first quarter takes on all the new compensation elements that come into play, which does have a negative impact on the margins early in the year, and they strengthen through the year. So I don't think we see the dynamics changing there.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Kreger.
John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
Given the very strong bookings you had in the quarter, can you just talk a bit about the duration of those wins compared to what you're seeing in your broader backlog? Just curious if there's any trends towards more multi-year awards versus shorter work.
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes. I mean, certainly, we've tended to focus a little bit on this multi-year. There's -- definitely, as we look at some of the projects we win, we commented in the third quarter about a 5-year agreement, which was much more of a renewal. So there's always elements of this that factor into the bookings. But anything that we book or any trials of a Phase III nature, generally, we've been very consistent. They're running out on an average over 50 to 53 months. It's extended out a bit to 53 months. And what we put into backlog I think is reasonably consistent with that. Clearly, John, our objective is to shorten times, create efficiency and shorten times. We have seen, and I think you heard us say, a little bit slower start-up in some cases, which has, perhaps, impacted our revenue burn slightly. With the real strength we had in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, that bodes well, I think Tom said as well, for the second half of next year as those projects really get into the monitoring and phase of the project.
Thomas H. Pike
I think -- John, it's Tom. I think we -- I'll just emphasize the point that Kevin made quickly before that the gross new business wins and therefore, also the project-based wins within this were very impressive. In fact, we don't have all the history in front of us, but it was either a record or it was a record, certainly, from the last several years. So I think we feel pretty good about the gross new business wins in this quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Can you talk a little bit about kind of like the RFP activity for 2015? And are you seeing new opportunity from kind of like new customers on the heels of the Covance takeout? And as a follow-up for -- on that one, do you think that we're entering a period of accelerating M&A in the CRO space?
Thomas H. Pike
Let me start that. I -- we have -- I think you guys probably know we always look at our RFP activity in our pipeline in advance of this call because we want to -- it's one of those indicators about the health of the industry that's really important. And interestingly, as we look at it this time, when you look at the project work, so the core clinical project work, we continue to be strong in that area in terms of opportunities. And in the last -- in the very recent past, we've seen a little bit of acceleration. As I mentioned before, we actually don't see the renewals on the horizon this year. So last year was a bit of the year of the renewal. This is a year where we're looking at strong traditional project services, and we are seeing small biopharma start contributing a larger share of those to what we see in our pipeline. And many of you well know that we've refocused a lot of our activities to really be able to use our strong, broad service offerings to help small biopharma really throughout the clinical development process, where we consult with them early on in terms of what they should do. We do the clinical operation services, and we even have a couple of situations now, we're helping them with the commercialization and giving them more options in terms of commercialization. So it's somewhat of a long answer, Ricky, to that piece. But it's just an interesting evolution we're seeing associated with small biopharma and being able to help them with the breadth of our services. And as you know, we're uniquely positioned to help them with commercial. In terms of the acceleration, you see it on small biopharma, but that is a relatively small percentage of the total. So it doesn't mean there's a massive acceleration. You just see them being a bigger proportion. And as I said, this quarter, the project-based pipeline is actually up a bit from the last couple of quarters. So you see it on that front. And then in terms of Covance, if I was better at spin, I would've not gotten to that part of the question, Ricky. But I think -- we're not seeing any particular impact, one way or the other, of that in the marketplace. So no -- if you look at our competitors, the last year, they really haven't been in the top 3, who we beat, so in -- on the clinical side. So I'm not -- we haven't really seen too much impact on a day-to-day basis. But when we look across, they haven't been in that group.
Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. And then just on M&A, do you think that it's kind of like what we've seen late last year? Is this a sign that we're going to see accelerated M&A activity in the space or do you think that this was more of kind of like a specific opportunity?
Thomas H. Pike
It feels a little bit to us like a specific opportunity, I have to say. We continue to focus on what we call tactical tuck-ins, so areas that would add value for our customers and our investors, the mix that we provide, much like the real-world, late phase addition has done so well for us over the last few years. But I don't think it bodes for any near-term restructuring of the industry. As I've said over the longer term, I do believe that we probably have too many competitors that are similar for the work that's out there. But in the near term, Ricky, I'm not seeing huge changes to industry structure taking place from my vantage point.

Your next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
You guys sort of touched on it, but maybe asking the marketplace question in a little bit different way. When you speak to this new management teams as they've created the 2015 budgets, what are they saying they'll do differently in '15 versus '14? I didn't -- I'd be interested in any color, but I'm just trying to get a better idea of how much of the growth you're seeing is coming from macro market trends versus share gains against, I guess, smaller competitors, if not large?
Thomas H. Pike
So we still see our market growing at 6% to 8%. We did some analysis of this over the last couple of quarters because it's been pretty clear that the mix change with small biopharma has been something that we needed to look at. But overall, we tend to see market growth in the 6% to 8% range. And so given that, we are growing with the market. We do still continue to see, and this may be unique to us, some proactive opportunities, where we're able to go to people with ideas about how they can get more value out of R&D or commercialization. And we're bringing those ideas, and they're being responded to very well by the customers. So that continues to be a focus for us here at Quintiles, bringing those kinds of ideas to customers, and that increases our ability to gain share. And then I do think the larger CROs continue to capture share from the smaller ones. We now have over 1,000 PhDs. And I just don't know how the small as -- really, the combination of therapies are getting more sophisticated. I just don't know how the smaller CROs are going to compete. And the model that we deliver under is becoming more global, and we're able to lower the cost per customers by using low-cost resources, technology, et cetera. And so in that world, I just don't know how smaller CROs are really going to compete over time because they just won't have the resources to make the investments required or have the globality that's required to deliver. So I think it is that combination of market growth and stealing some share as well.
Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Got it. And you mentioned biopharma a few times. So how does that change the -- as it becomes a larger percentage of your book, how does that change the business structure of Quintiles? Is it fit right in or is there other changes you're looking to make as a result of it being a larger part of the book?
Thomas H. Pike
It fits pretty well in. The thing that we have to do is -- it's interesting. With the large pharmaceutical firm who's been doing clinical research for most of their life, which could be a 50-year life, in some cases, or more, they have significant skills and they have very specific requests for work for us. But with small biopharma, they really need our consultative help. Because you may have between 3 and 40 employees who have a compound or a platform, and they really need some help trying to figure out what indications it may work for, what complications they'll run into, what their regulatory strategy should be. And so what we do with smaller biopharmas, we bring together our strengths, and we're really able to have a more consultative relationship and sale. We -- it's harder for us to announce sole-source when comes to small biopharma because they're not going to use a lot of providers. But one of the big focuses for us is that we're trying to develop the kinds of relationships, where we can really be their go-to company when it comes to clinical development commercialization. And we've had a lot of success there, and so we've evolved our service model for small biopharma so that they can get the resources of Quintiles without feeling like they have to talk to too many people or feeling like they've -- they don't get the high-touch service quality that they would get with a small CRO. So we now have service models evolving to give them higher touch and give them access to the deep resources.

Your next question comes from the line of Dave Windley.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
My question is around the contributions or the relative contributions to your growth. Your relative book-to-bills in the segments are, as you stated, a little stronger on the Product Development side. And you've also said, though, that with some cancellations, it may get off to a slower start and accelerate through the year. I guess what I'm interested in is around that 7.5% to 9% growth range that you're providing, will each segment contribute approximately equally? Or how should we think about the relative contributions by Product Development and IHS to that growth rate?
Kevin K. Gordon
I think over the course of the year, Dave, they're going to end up contributing similarly. Obviously, IHS will have a bit of a contribution in the first half from Encore that will contribute nicely for the first half. And then I think the cancellation comment pertain more to the Product Development side, so you would actually see that one strengthening on a growth rate in the second half, and the IHS probably more normalizing. So -- but over the full course of the year, I would expect them to be reasonably similar.
David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Okay. And if I could follow-on, Tom, you commented about that 6% to 8% type industry growth rate and your -- strength of your pipeline of project-related work. How do you think about industry growth, say, beyond the visibility that projects in your marketing log would tell you? With outsourcing penetration having risen for several years, the drivers of late-stage clinical demand have been strong for 5 or 6 years, which is kind of the normal duration of a cycle in this business. How do you think about the sustainability of growth beyond the visibility that kind of current RFPs show you?
Thomas H. Pike
There's really a few things that we look at, Dave, as we think about it because you're right. What happens is, you have to think a little bit more strategically about the long term, to think beyond just the pure pipeline. And I do think -- when we look at the larger pharmaceutical firms, we still see leverage points where we can lower their costs as they really need more flexibility in their business model. If you think about the number of large pharmaceutical firms who have now said that they're going to use small biotech or they're going to use academic institutions as a key part of their innovation, what it means is, essentially, they're variabilizing their model a bit. And as they variabilize how they find their compounds, they also have the opportunity to variabilize how they develop those compounds. And so I think that bodes well for the future that they need more flexibility. And by the way, the same thing carries through to the IHS side in 2 ways: one is in terms of them not wanting to hire more sales reps; and the other, in terms of just the change in the regulatory regimes around the use of real-world data as part of the regulatory scheme, in particular, for any kind of conditional approvals and other things that you see, for instance, coming out of EMEA. So both of those factors bode well. I also think, just in general, the targeted therapies that we're seeing now, there are some indications that they're having a higher success rate. And what really -- what our industry needs, and when I say our industry, I really speak to the pharmaceutical industry in general, is if we can increase that success rate by just 1% or 2%, it's a -- that's a fundamental growth factor for the industry. And what you are seeing is you're seeing companies, leading companies, invest their success back in new medications, new therapies. And so I think what we're seeing right now is a good trend for the industry because the targeted therapies having better success rates. And in general, what you're seeing is you're seeing these pharmaceutical firms that have success trying to reinvest back in their pipelines into the market. So that's what makes me feel good about the future. And then the near-term pipeline is pretty good, which supports the theory.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Baker.
Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Tom, you've been always a big proponent of ownership of Central Lab. Absent kind of the slowdown that you mentioned, I was just wondering to what extent you're seeing any benefits around the ability to identify and get patients enrolled in trials quicker and what you think -- how -- what do you see in terms of further improvements on that front?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, it's -- we are proponents of the Central Lab. I think if you look in general at the amount of information that's now going in the regulatory submissions from the lab, it's grown. And the complexity of testing, the ability to take a sample, test it once, but then actually keep it in storage and test it again later on or have it available for further testing is growing. And so we do think the lab work is a key part of the clinical process, and we're seeing more and more need. Because the lab work is getting more sophisticated, our expertise is really working well for us in terms of trying to make sure people are doing the right tests and have the right protocol for the trials. Interestingly, as you say, we do use our lab data to find patients as well. We have a significant amount of lab data. We tend to use electronic health records. We have a number of relationships in exploratory areas there in terms of the use of electronic health record, which is really the source of information around patients and diseases and their current diagnoses. But like others, we've certainly -- you continue to explore different sources of information that help us find patients, in particular, around rare diseases, in particular, genomic situations, et cetera. So the lab is very important, in general, and I think all of us are looking at innovative data to help make sure that we find patients for clinical trials.

Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Kevin, I just want to go back and confirm that the 12% to 16% EPS growth outlook for 2015 does not include any buyback. And then I guess, if that's right, related to that, I look at $900 million in cash on the balance sheet. Just wondering if you could maybe share with us how you are thinking about buybacks, both the traditional buybacks and those that you've been doing to absorb secondaries.
Kevin K. Gordon
Yes, sure. You're right. I will confirm that the guidance does not include the repurchase of any shares. We do have $60 million thereabouts remaining under the existing buyback program that's been authorized by our Board of Directors, so that does exist there. And as far as when or how we use that, I think we'll continue to reserve judgment and use that should we choose to do that. As -- in terms of cash, I think you heard me say that just over $200 million of that cash resides in the United States today. So we do have some programs that get us more access to that cash that's built into some of that tax planning that Doug was asking about earlier. But in the short term, from a capital structure standpoint, from investment, we continue to look at our inorganic activities. We continue to look at our organic investments in our business. And then ultimately, Bob, if we come down to a conclusion that there's a better use of that cash than getting into the shareholders, then we'll look at opportunities to continue to do that.
Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And I guess just if I could sneak in a related want to you, Tom. I know you commented on acquisitions. But with no buybacks really baked in and a pretty healthy cash position, albeit some overseas, a good portion of it overseas, how are you thinking about M&A? I mean, are you -- I know you mentioned tuck-ins. Are you open to considering larger M&A if the opportunity does arise, given your strong balance sheet position right now?
Thomas H. Pike
I think what you heard from us since our IPO roadshow is that we are about creating value for our customers and for investors. And if we think that there's a combination of things that provides better service to our customers and creates value for investors, we'd consider it. I will say in terms of actively looking, though, what we're actively looking at is the tuck-ins and the ability to take business segments we have, make them more effective for our customers, really looking closely at that, creating more value in the IHS side of the business.
Kevin K. Gordon
And Bob, I'd also say, when I look at the cash, as we look at our inorganic, we are very focused on looking at growth outside of North America as well. So the fact that, that cash is over there, there's opportunity for us to grow in emerging markets or other markets, where we can service our customers or find capabilities that are additive to our offering. The use of that cash overseas is certainly not limited from that perspective, so we certainly look to grow globally and contribute to the business.

Your next question comes from the line of George Hill.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Tom, you talked about renewals being a strong part of the bookings in 2014, but revisions are going upsize, and pricing is solid. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about the pricing environment? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, pricing really remains basically the same, interestingly. It's -- we tend to like the fact that a couple of the competitors have become public, and that will -- because you guys will chase after them about their margins. That will make sure that they're rational. You have one more to go, and then we'll make -- I think that will help the industry, frankly. And so interestingly, pricing, for instance, for Kevin and I, has not been a big subject that we speak about recently because it's been pretty steady in terms of what we've looked at. Interestingly, in the small biopharma sector, they look for a good pricing, but what they really want is they want results. And so as that segment grows, it's an attractive segment to serve.
George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay, that's helpful color, and I'll say we like to do our part on that end. And then you're the second CRO to kind of comment this earning season on project starts coming out of the gate a little slower than historical. I guess, are there any specific trends that you're seeing driving that? Is it tied to any disease state or product
classes under development? And any color there would be great.
Thomas H. Pike
Yes, I wouldn't so much put it to any in particular, but I do think there are couple of factors. There's been some work that you guys probably had seen from Tufts about the increasing complexity associated with trials, depending whose numbers you see, see 57%, 58% increase associated with complexity, a number of other factors. And what we are finding is that, in some cases, the protocols take longer to work through with the regulatory authorities than they did in the past. In some cases, you take a rare disease or -- I was just -- I had a great meeting yesterday with our genomic sequencing group, and we were talking a little bit about the need to pre-profile patients for screening for certain oncology trials. And you start thinking about some of the complexities that we have. Or adding imaging if you're doing an Alzheimer's trial, you're actually adding imaging. You may be also adding sequencing to that. And so you think about the number of things that now need to happen to actually identify a patient who's qualified to be in the trial. And those types of things are taking a little longer. Now on the other hand, because they're more complex, they're more costly. So the cost per patient is going up, which, for the CRO industry, generally is good. For the pharmaceutical firms, not quite as good. But for the CRO industry, it's good. So you have a few dynamics that make us feel like the overall dollar size stays similar. The complexity goes up, the cost per patient goes up a little bit, and there are some elements that make it last longer. We're going to take one more question because Kevin tells me I was long-winded on that answer.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask a little bit more in depth on the Product Development margin. You've commented in the past that you kind of expected this margin to be stable. And yet you've done a really good job with it, even putting FX aside. So on an organic -- or a constant currency basis, it's been very, very strong. I understand a lot of it is just kind of operational block and tackling. But can you put a finer point on exactly what you're doing there, particularly as you've commented in the past that you are expecting some pricing pressure -- just normal pricing pressure in that part of the business?
Thomas H. Pike
I think the focus -- and you may recall that one of our strategic agenda items is productivity, delivery and quality. And what we're doing is we're taking the same types of approaches that other global businesses have in the past associated with trying to make sure that work is done in the right locations from a costing standpoint, where we can maintain the quality and improve the cost profile using a greater amount of technology, which gives you more leverage associated with personnel costs and frankly, just managing the business in a way that world-class companies do. And that's associated with salary curves and right people for the right job. And so the focus that we've had on the global delivery network has been key. And I have to say, I have to really complement our executives and employees because they've really done a great job of trying to make sure that we provide the best cost profile possible for our customers as we take on the work and we continue to be in a competitive pricing environment. So I'll really simplify it to implementing global best practices associated with workforce and technology that is paying results for our customers and for our investors.
Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And just a quick follow-up. It looks like in your guidance, you'll need to wring a little bit more out of that in 2015. So are you anticipating that there's still stuff to be done here?
Thomas H. Pike
Yes.
Kevin K. Gordon
We do, Tim, but I think there's also a positive impact from currency in that guidance as well. So as you look at where currency rates are, we talked about the significant headwind on the revenue being 420 basis points in that constant currency revenue guidance. But even so, with the way currencies have moved, it does have some contribution a little bit to that guidance as well and the bottom line.
Thomas H. Pike
