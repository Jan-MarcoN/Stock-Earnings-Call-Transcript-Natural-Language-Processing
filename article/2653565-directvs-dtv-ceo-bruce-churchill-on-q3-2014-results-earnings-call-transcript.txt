Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DIRECTV's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Martin Sheehan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Martin Sheehan
Thank you, Christie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2014 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, our CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; Michelle Locke, CFO of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel. In a moment, I'll hand over the call to Mike, Bruce, Pat for some introductory remarks. But first, I need to read to you the following.
On this call, we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in each of DIRECTV's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.
Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for financial results, liquidity and capital resources. Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures, which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at directv.com.
With that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.
Michael D. White
Thanks, Martin, and we're all proud at DIRECTV of Martin and being recognized by Institutional Investor Magazine as one of the best IR professionals, and we certainly believe that, too.
Thanks, all, for joining us today. And I'd just start out by saying I continue to be pleased with our quarterly results, particularly given the many headwinds the industry and our businesses are collectively facing.
Now in the U.S., it's pretty clear we had a bit of a tougher competitive and consumer economic environment, and I think that weighed on our subscriber results. But I'm sure we'll talk later about the subscriber results. I frankly think they were more of a one-off series of events.
Meanwhile, our revenues were solid, while both our earnings and our cash flow were very strong. And in Latin America, local currency results, which is the way we run the business, were also strong. Although foreign exchange headwinds and the predictive rebound effect of the World Cup weighed on the U.S. dollar and subscriber results, and Bruce will address that as well.
With regards to the AT&T transaction, during the quarter, we completed 2 important milestones that we needed to, to close the merger. The first was our successful shareholder vote, in which over 99% of our shareholders cast votes in favor of the transaction. And the second was -- is I'm sure you've all read the signing of our long-term agreement with the National Football League to continue our 20-year partnership, offering our hallmark NFL SUNDAY TICKET package. In addition to that, the Brazilian telecom authority, Anatel, also approved the transaction during the quarter.
Now this leaves us with the regulatory review process here in the U.S. and in Mexico. We're making progress in Mexico. As it relates to the U.S., as I'm sure you're aware, the FCC had halted its 180-day review clock of our transaction at day 76 as they worked through a number of issues with the content providers regarding a review of their confidential contracts and related materials. Based on the FCC's orders entered earlier this week, we now expect the clock will start again sometime mid-next week.
That said, I would remind you, it's not unusual for the FCC to halt the clock in large deals like ours, and it's certainly possible that they will stop the clock again at some point in the future. But in the meantime, we continue to work diligently with both the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission to fulfill all of their information and data requests, answer their questions so that we can help them make an informed decision on the merits of this transaction and based on the facts that we're submitting.
In summary, I believe the process is going well, and I remain confident that we'll close the transaction some time probably in the second quarter of next year.
Turning to the U.S. Our financial results were very strong, mainly resulting from our continuing strategy to focus on higher-quality subscribers. Specifically, we continue to generate mid-single-digit revenue and earnings growth due to the positive effects of disciplined price increases and improved penetrations of our Genie HD DVR, coupled with the positive impact of our disciplined approach to both new gross adds and cost management. These positive effects drove the fifth consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year OPBDA margins for the U.S. business.
Now with regards to the subscriber results, as I mentioned at a recent investor conference, the combination of further tightening credit scores on certain customer segments, in particular, I would say, lower-income renters, more aggressive offers from the competition and consumers have continued to be more and more price sensitive, led to a loss of 28,000 net subscribers in the quarter.
During the quarter, we saw discounting and in particular, cash back offers and bounties that, in some cases, were both significantly higher than a year ago, but also extended that heavily discounted fixed price for 2 full years. This, along with consumers who are increasingly under stress from the ongoing weak economy, resulted in more customers than ever shopping for better deals, which caused our monthly churn rate to climb higher than, frankly, we wanted. For these reasons as well as the industry's programming costs challenges, our primary goal continues to be attracting high-quality subscribers who generate strong returns and value, while also balancing our churn levels with the retention investments to keep our best customers.
By the way, these and several other steps we've taken in our call centers with our information systems have reduced October's churn rate to be more in line with last year, where we'd like it to be. But given the current environment, this remains an ongoing challenge for the business. Having said that, we're making good progress.
These circumstances are also the main driver behind our focus on the overall customer experience and product innovation, both of which are becoming an increasingly important differentiator for our service in the marketplace.
To that end, we continue to launch exciting new products and enhancements for our customers, including several marketing investments we'll be making in the coming months: Global viewing, which will allow consumers to start a program on one device and pick it up from the same spot on another, including the set-top box; our new Hispanic OTT service, which we'll launch towards the end of the quarter and feature both live linear and SVOD content; a new 4K Ultra HD VOD offering for those customers with our Genie HD DVR; and a DIRECTV 4K-ready television from Samsung.
And on a related note, our DIRECTV 14 satellite is scheduled to be launched next month on December 4, allowing us to introduce additional 4K channels in 2015 as well as providing important in-orbit backup capacity for our service.
So we continue to make good progress in improving the DIRECTV customer experience from both the service and offering perspective, as I said, making us continue to have a true competitive differentiator in the industry.
Turning to Latin America. Bruce will dive into the details, but I'm also pleased with their quarterly results, which continue to be consistent with the key financial and strategic priorities that we shared with you earlier this year.
Sky Brasil drove DTVLA revenue growth of 10% in the quarter, led by continued subscriber growth over the last year and strong local currency ARPU growth. In fact, DTVLA's local currency ARPU grew 15% in the quarter, helping to increase local currency revenue 28%. This revenue growth combined with disciplined cost management to drive better-than-expected margins when adjusting for a charge related to the decline in the value of the Venezuelan bolÃ­var as well as last year's ECAD gain in Brazil.
And as we said on last quarter's call, the unexpectedly strong prepaid subscriber additions in the second quarter, caused by the start of the World Cup, did result as expected in a larger decline in reconnects in the third quarter, in particular in Argentina, as the World Cup came to a close, resulting in a net loss of 119,000 customers for DTVLA in the quarter.
Finishing up on the financials. Given the challenges we face in many of these countries, the team's efforts at improving cash flow generation, I think, are particularly impressive. Now as you know, one of our main goals this year has been to ensure that DTVLA is self-funded. As such, through the first 9 months of the year and excluding Venezuela, DTVLA has improved its cash flow generation by over $400 million from a year ago and is currently positive in the region, ahead of meeting our goal.
And finally, DTVLA also continues to raise the bar in terms of the customer experience as just last month, we successfully launched DLA-1 aboard Intelsat's IS-30 satellite. DLA-1 will significantly enhance the entertainment experience that's transformed DIRECTV into the preferred pay TV service all across Latin America, ensuring we have a road map of evolution and innovation for the future.
And don't forget that most of the great new U.S. features that I talked about earlier will, of course, be available over time in Latin America. These are features that, unlike in the U.S., very few of our competitors in Latin America have or are investing in.
So in summary, I'm pleased with our financial results as we continue to demonstrate our focus on profitably growing our businesses and generating meaningful cash flow. And with the positive collaboration, I think the outstanding collaboration I'm seeing between the AT&T and DIRECTV teams that are planning for our proposed combination, I'm even more excited about the opportunities for the combined company to be more competitive and to find new growth opportunities together.
Before I turn the call over to Bruce, I'd just like to highlight another achievement for our company last month. We were added to the Carbon Disclosure Project's Climate Performance Leadership Index for 2014, scoring in the top 10% of over 2,000 companies worldwide. This is the third such honor for DIRECTV over the last year, and I think is a real testament to our employees' commitment to social responsibility and creating a truly sustainable business. Congratulations to the DIRECTV sustainability team that work on that for another important accomplishment.
With that, Bruce?
Bruce Barrett Churchill
Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned, Latin America's third quarter financial results continued to be strong on a local currency basis, despite some challenging economic conditions in a handful of countries. In addition, as we expected, the completion of the FIFA World Cup drove lower reconnects -- reconnect rates from prepaid subscribers, resulting in a modest loss of subscribers in the quarter.
Local currency revenue growth was the highlight in the third quarter as we continue to balance the economic trade-off between increasing prices to keep up with inflation and reducing credits to lower-quality customers, with the inevitable increase in churn that these actions precipitate.
As for profitability, although it's a bit of a confusing comparison, if you exclude Venezuela from the results as well as the $70 million one-time gain from ECAD from last year's third quarter, DTVLA OPBDA margins were virtually unchanged, demonstrating our commitment to profitably grow this business.
Turning to Brazil. Sky Brasil gross additions improved on a year-over-year basis for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching a third quarter record of 521,000, a 7% improvement from a year ago. The higher gross adds were driven by an increase in new HD customers, which increased by nearly 2/3 in the quarter compared to a year ago.
In addition, although the total number of middle market gross additions didn't change much, the mix did. Fully 1/3 of the middle market gross additions were prepaid customers. As I have said before, we think the prepaid model is a better fit for mass market consumers, particularly in difficult economic times, and leads to a better return for DIRECTV because of lower subscriber acquisition and subscriber service expense. So I'm encouraged that our efforts to introduce prepaid in Brazil are gaining traction.
Postpaid churn is still higher than I would like at 2.72%, up from a year ago, mainly due to the end of the World Cup as well as our conscious effort to reduce credits to lower-valued subscribers. But again, we believe we're making the right trade-offs between ARPU and churn to improve the overall value of the business.
Summing up, net additions in the quarter totaled 27,000, lifting the Sky Brasil cumulative customer base to just north of 5.64 million, a 7% increase from a year ago.
Turning now to the financial results of Sky Brasil. The 7% increase in the subscriber base and 5% higher local currency ARPU drove a 14% increase in local currency revenues versus the prior year. The ARPU increase was driven by reduced levels of retention credits and a 25% increase in subscribers paying for advanced services, partially offset by the new lower ARPU prepaid offering. As a result, the combination of higher ARPU and our continued focus on cost management drove a 7% improvement in local currency OPBDA when excluding the $70 million ECAD gain from the prior year period.
In dollar terms, revenue and OPBDA grew 15% and 8%, respectively, as the average value of the real increased about 1% versus a year ago to BRL 2.28 to $1. Overall, Brazil had a solid quarter. And although net subscriber adds are probably slightly behind where we expected them to be, we're on track to meet our local currency outlook of approximately 10% revenue growth and mid- to high-single-digit OPBDA growth when excluding last year's ECAD gain.
Moving on to PanAmericana, where gross additions fell 12% to 472,000 in the quarter, driven by the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup as well as weaker regional macroeconomic conditions and higher credit filters for new customers. The decline was felt about equally across both prepaid and postpaid subscribers, although advanced product sales grew a modest 4%. Postpaid churn increased 11 basis points to a still very low 1.25%, mainly due to the end of the World Cup, the impact of price increases and the challenging economic environment in certain countries.
That said, despite a decline in gross additions and the higher churn, PanAmericana generated modest postpaid net subscriber additions in the quarter. The big swing for the quarter was in our prepaid customer base, where the perfect storm of multiple price increases and the hangover from the World Cup led to both a reduction in sales and lower reconnect rates.
The prepaid losses were particularly pronounced in Argentina, which accounted for more than half of the prepaid subscriber losses. Adding it all up, PanAmericana subscriber numbers fell by 146,000 in the quarter to 6.7 million total customers. Roughly 2.3 million or 35% of that total are prepaid customers using our on-off metric at the end of the quarter. Using our 90-day metric, the number of prepaid customers would be 3.5 million, an increase of 25% from 1 year ago.
PanAmericana's revenue in the quarter increased 45% in local currency, generated by a 13% increase in the average number of subscribers and a 28% increase in ARPU, resulting from price increases, along with a 17% lift in customers paying for advanced services. With regards to OPBDA, the SICAD 1 auction rate we used to translate Venezuelan bolÃ­vares to U.S. dollars depreciated from VEF 10.7 to VEF 12 during the quarter. This resulted in a $62 million charge to the revaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela.
So if you exclude the Venezuela foreign exchange charge, in dollar terms, adjusted OPBDA in the quarter increased slightly to $208 million, while adjusted OPBDA margin fell slightly to just below 26%. The margin decline was a result of the impact of the Venezuela devaluation on average margins as well as inflationary pressure on the labor cost in both Venezuela and Argentina. Excluding the Venezuela business entirely, margins actually improved 2 percentage points in the quarter, driven by strong local currency ARPU growth and disciplined cost management.
So in summary, PanAmericana delivered a quarter very much in line with our expectations, leaving us on track to hit the full year guidance we gave you at the end of the first quarter of roughly unchanged revenues compared with last year and mid- to high-single-digit decline in OPBDA.
Lastly, on PanAmericana, I wanted to update you on the newest member of the DIRECTV fleet. As Mike mentioned, on October 16, we successfully launched a new satellite for PanAmericana that will go into service later this year. The new satellite will provide us with the capacity to increase substantially our HD offering as well as expand our SD service.
Wrapping up on the outlook for the consolidated entity. Net subscriber additions will likely come in closer to 900,000 for the year. But barring any significant changes in foreign exchange rates during the quarter, we continue to expect revenues and dollars will be relatively unchanged from a year ago, and adjusted OPBDA will decline in the low-single digits, excluding the ECAD gain from a year ago. And as Mike mentioned earlier, cash flow generation is ahead of plan, leaving us on track for DTVLA to be self-funded in 2014.
Finally, I would like to quickly mention Sky Mexico, whose results were released by Televisa a few weeks ago. Sky Mexico added 160,000 net additions in the quarter, bringing their cumulative total of customers to just over 6.5 million. In addition, Sky generated solid growth in local currency revenues and OPBDA of 9% and 14%, respectively.
Overall, I continue to be pleased with Latin America's performance in light of the conditions we're operating in. Our team continues to focus on profitably growing the business by balancing subscriber growth, SAC, pricing and churn levels in a challenging economic and competitive environment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat. Pat?
Patrick T. Doyle
Thanks, Bruce. The DIRECTV U.S. business delivered yet another quarter of strong financial results, which exceeded our internal expectations, particularly with regards to growth in operating profit before depreciation and amortization as well as cash flow.
The one area of weakness in the quarter was our subscriber results, where we experienced a net loss of 28,000 customers in the quarter, driven by a decline in gross additions and higher churn. Gross additions declined 8% on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to stricter credit policies implemented during the quarter. These stricter credit policies were applied as a result of improvements in our lifetime value or LTV model, which I mentioned in our last earnings call as likely to create a drag on gross additions.
These model improvements allowed us to pinpoint a segment of the population we've previously believed to be a value-accretive group, but in reality were negative LTV customers. As such, we instituted an upfront fee for these prospective customers, which generally causes the customer to decide not to sign up for our service, hence, impacting gross additions, but ultimately allowing us to save on acquisitions costs that would not be value accretive.
Churn was also a challenge in the quarter as we saw a 12 basis point increase in our average monthly rate to 1.73%. The major factors causing the increase were the competitive environment, a challenged consumer as well as the timing of some of our promotional roll-offs.
As we discussed on our Q2 call, we saw an uptick in the discounting and cash back offers we were seeing coming into the quarter. And in fact, some companies are still offering nearly an extra $1,000 of discounts over the first 2 years of service compared to their offers a year ago.
In addition, we are seeing that consumers are becoming much more price sensitive in this economic environment. We know this from the nature of the phone calls we receive from our customers, with a higher volume of customer calls relating to the amount of the bill. This has been exacerbated by larger promotional offer roll-offs that are coinciding with the customers' commitment expiration.
The net result in the quarter was higher churn and resulting subscriber losses. Also keep in mind that during Q3 of 2013, there were 2 major disputes between our competitors and programmers, which caused both lift in our gross additions and also lowered our churn in the year ago quarter. How much is difficult to quantify, of course.
I should also add that our Q4 gross additions are recovering toward last year's trends as our sales partners adjust to the updated scoring system, and we freshen up and simplify our offers to drive additional demand, with the good news being that this is resulting in an even better mix of quality subscribers.
In addition, as Mike said, we continue to balance our retention credits and spending with churn to focus on saving our best customers, and we are seeing positive trends in churn so far in the fourth quarter. That said, based on Q3 subscriber results and current trends, we expect subscriber growth to be fairly neutral this year, slightly positive or slightly negative, depending on a number of factors, but particularly on the competitive environment as well as the impact of any programming disputes during the quarter.
Moving on to the financials. Revenue growth of 5.4% was very solid, highlighting the strength of the DIRECTV brand in the marketplace and was driven by ARPU growth of 4.8%, demonstrating our pricing power amidst a challenging U.S. operating environment.
Consistent with recent trends, the key drivers of our ARPU growth were price increases on programming packages and increased penetration of customers paying for our Genie HD DVR as well as our enhanced warranty program. ARPU also benefited from a 23% increase in ad sales, driven by addressable advertising, which roughly doubled on a year-over-year basis for the seventh consecutive quarter. In addition, commercial revenues continued its string of quarterly double-digit growth. These improvements were slightly offset by increased promotions and credits to existing customers as well as weak pay-per-view event sales.
Last year's third quarter included a very popular Floyd Mayweather fight, whereas a similar card underperformed this year. In addition, UFC Mixed Martial Arts underperformed, in part due to the cancellation of one of their events during the quarter.
Moving now to the bottom line. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization margin improved for the ninth time in the last 10 quarters, driving OPBDA growth to nearly 11%. Margin improvement was seen across the majority of the P&L, led by upgrade and retention costs as lower equipment costs were the primary driver in the category.
In addition, subscriber services continues to be a good story as our customer experience initiatives continue to drive down call volume as well as unnecessary truck rolls. And in addition to our disciplined expense management, the margin improvement in G&A is mainly resulting from a combination of an improving subscriber quality as well as process improvement that have been driving down our bad debt levels despite higher revenues and a still struggling consumer economy. And of course, the lower gross additions resulted in slower growth in our expense acquisition costs, which also contributed to the margin improvement.
Moving on to broadcast programming and other costs. Although pressuring margins slightly, these areas continue to perform ahead of our expectations. This was in part due to lower cost for our protection plan, which is being driven by improving set-top box quality. As an example, at this point in its life cycle, the new Genie box has the lowest failure rate of any box we've ever produced, keeping in mind that this is also the most advanced and sophisticated box we have ever designed.
And specifically on content cost, annual programmer rate increases drove our average programming costs per subscriber or ACPU up 5.3% in the quarter, lower than our plan. The quarter's performance was driven by 3 areas: Our continuing commitment to hold out against exorbitant price increases demanded by certain programmers to the point of either dropping or not carrying overpriced channels, several one-time programming adjustments and the lower event pay-per-view performance in the quarter.
Based on our year-to-date performance in the category, we now expect ACPU growth to be a bit below our 7% to 9% growth rate target for the full year, keeping in mind that we have several large contact -- contract renewals that will take effect in the fourth quarter.
So wrapping up on U.S., we are right on target to achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth and expect to be a bit on the high side of our mid-single-digit OPBDA growth target. Combining this with an expected decline in CapEx, and we are on track for a high single-digit cash flow growth in the U.S., following the formula we laid out for you at our Investor Day in December.
Looking quickly at our Q3 consolidated results. Adjusting for the $62 million Venezuela devaluation charge in the quarter as well as a $70 million after-tax gain from the ECAD settlement a year ago, diluted earnings per share grew mid- to high teens in the quarter.
In addition, we continue to generate strong free cash flow as it more than doubled the $792 million in the quarter, driven by higher OPBDA, lower set-top box costs and the timing of set-top box purchases at DTVLA. Last year's free cash flow was also impacted by the $92 million settlement payment to ECAD.
Before wrapping up, I would like to make a few comments about our outlook, which, as you've heard, both DIRECTV U.S. and DIRECTV Latin America are on track to meet guidance for all of their key financial metrics.
In addition, we now expect to be on the high side of our mid- to high-single-digit growth target for adjusted EPS from $5.42 a year ago. This excludes the Venezuela devaluation charges in 2013 and 2014, and we now expect free cash flow growth to increase nearly 20% over 2013 levels. This is up from our early projection of 10% growth. The improvement is being driven in part by the improved OPBDA outlook in the U.S. as well as a reduction in income tax payments. Keep in mind, we're up against a very challenging comparison in Q4 as the timing of receipts last year resulted in $1 billion of free cash flow generation.
Wrapping up, 2014 continues to look like it will be a solid year. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Martin.
Martin Sheehan
Thanks, Pat. Before moving on to Q&A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in a listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media that they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call, either directly or in substance, other than the representatives of DIRECTV. In addition, we are webcasting this call live on the Internet, and an archived copy will be available on our website. [Operator Instructions] Christie, at this time, we're ready for your -- for the first question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I just had a question for Mr. White. Regarding the Hispanic OTT offer that, I think, you guys have publicly said you're planning on launching, can you just describe a little bit about who the target customer is? I mean, obviously, it's Hispanic, but is it a Hispanic customer that is not part of the pay TV ecosystem today? Is that sort of the angle you're going after?
Michael D. White
Yes. I think, Jason, just like -- if you hear about -- a lot of the OTT thinking, I think, is that there's a significant segment of consumers out there that are broadband only. I would also tell you, in the Hispanic segment in particular, they -- we've analyzed the Hispanic population. They tend to be above-average users of broadband. So it'll have telenovelas. We're pretty excited about it. It's got a lot of good content from a number of our programming partners. We think it's good value, and I think the platform has been built. I'm excited. I've seen the demo of our -- of the technology. I think we feel really good about that, and we're excited to get that out the door in the fourth quarter. I think we'll get a lot of learnings as we go in 2015 from that initiative. And again, the technology is scalable and could be leveraged on other initiatives down the road.
Operator
We'll go next to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I guess, 2 things. One, if you can talk about the 4K efforts that are coming. What do you see in the pipe for content there? And how many channels could you offer a year from now? And then second, if you can talk about prepaid in Brazil. You said that was -- I think it was 1/3 of one of the types of gross adds. If you can give a little more detail on where the eventual mix there you think is.
Michael D. White
Sure, Phil. I'll start on the 4K thing. Now, I mean, let's all keep in mind, we always want to be leading our industry as a company, and 4K is no exception. Now my understanding of the total number of TVs sold this year is maybe a million. So I think -- I know for a fact that a number of the television set manufacturers are hoping to have multiples of that sold in 2015. Initially, the 4K offering in the fourth quarter is going to be VOD only. So it'll be some video on demand, you'll need to have a Genie HD DVR as well as a 4K-ready television from Samsung. Now for those customers who have that Samsung TV as well as our Genie HD DVR, we're going to load a few 4K movies onto the hard drive for instant viewing. In addition, we'll have additional 4K titles that those customers can select, which they could download overnight. The preloaded number of movies is, of course, flexible. So if demand's strong, we can preload more movies into the hard drive. But let's understand, it's very early days for 4K. We've already secured the rights for a number of movies, I think, maybe a dozen, Pat, as I recall, something like that.
Patrick T. Doyle
Somewhat, yes.
Michael D. White
A little more. And we felt that was important, Phil, to have some, let's call it, kind of some content as a starter to get people to see what the experience is all about. Now once our satellite goes up in December and gets fully deployed in the first quarter of next year, we will have the capacity to both do substantially greater VOD as well as live streaming. And I'm not going to get into the specific number of channels now. And frankly, I think, to be honest with you, we need to see who's interested in a channel. I'm guessing, at least initially, it's more likely to be event driven or VOD driven, but we'll be prepared to do live streaming next year. Bruce?
Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay, that makes sense. It sounded like you're a little further ahead than that.
Michael D. White
Well, that's always our goal.
Bruce Barrett Churchill
So in the statement, what I said was that -- total gross adds of 521,000, of which -- they're split between sort of advanced products and middle market and other. But ballpark, roughly a little less than 400,000 of that 500,000 are middle market and 1/3 of those were prepaid, just to be clear. Right now, we have about 350,000 prepaid subscribers in Brazil. So it's obviously a pretty small number because we're just getting started. It's difficult, to be honest, for me to predict how big it could be. As I mentioned, I think we're at about a 35% level in PanAmericana. Intuitively, I think it will be -- end up long term being a bit less in Brazil, but I -- it's more intuitive than it is scientific. So -- but we've got obviously a ways to go.
Operator
We'll go next to John Hodulik with UBS.
John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. Getting back to the competitive environment. Is the increasing intensity coming solely from the cable companies? Or are you also seeing pressure from -- renewed pressure from the telco guys? But just looking at the numbers, it looks like cable is really driving the ball forward here. And then lastly, is there any evidence, you think, in the numbers that you're seeing increasing impact from over-the-top options or cord-cutting?
Michael D. White
Yes, John. I'll take the second part of it first. I mean, I think it's still early days to read, and there were so many one-offs in our third quarter. I mean, let's separate gross adds and churn, and Pat touched on it. But in terms of gross adds, first of all, we were lapping last summer, where you had the Time Warner Cable-CBS dispute, and I believe DISH was in a dispute with Raycom, whereas this summer, we were in a dispute with Raycom. And there were some pretty aggressive bounties being paid by cable companies, in particular, to get satellite customers. So that, plus our normal process -- we always, a couple of times a year, review our LTV models. And out of that, we both found that, frankly, our high-end customers were actually more valuable and therefore, we kind of have taken some steps to try and do more things with our higher-end customers, sell them more services, because they're more -- even more valuable than we thought. But we found that, that low-end segment of renters was just not profitable at all because most renters are churning out before the 2 years is up. And then we continue to see softness in the housing market, particularly first-time buyers. Now I would say, in terms of the gross add stuff, even now that most of the industry results, if not all, are pretty close to all in, I don't think there was a big shift between cable, telco or otherwise on the gross add side. We -- for us, if you looked at our actual numbers, there was -- I don't think there was hardly any shift on the gross adds between channels. The channels kind of were flat, so -- as a percent. So total cable was 55%. That is the gross adds we got. We got 55% of them from total cable. And last year, we got 55% from total cable. Where we did see a slight shift, John, was in churn. And in churn, it's certainly true, they were a couple of hundred basis points higher. So last year, I think 39% of our churn went to cable, and this year, it was 41%. So it was up just a touch. But to be honest with you, the whole churn subject, there were a lot of things going on. In particular, a couple of years ago, if you recall, we were kind of doing an Advanced Receiver fee for $25, but we discounted it to $12. So then when we got that -- so when you got both programming credits rolling off as well as that, that's what we mean by a double roll-off, that created some issues for us. Now by the way, with our simpler offer this year, we don't do that anymore. We have kind of an everyday low price on the equipment. So -- but the issue kind of popped up in the third quarter. It'll continue, but we've taken some steps to adjust some of our tactics. And as I said, October looked good. Now -- I mean, we'll see what the rest of the year is. And always, you can have a -- these programming disputes seem to be an integral part of everyday life for a distributor these days. So we will -- we're going to do what's right for the company long term. We don't -- I'm not afraid to take a little churn, if it's the right thing to do, in any given programming dispute. But that's kind of where we netted out in the quarter. And by the way, both September and October were net positive, just for the record. So I think we're kind of on track for the balance of the year, but we did have a little bit of a hiccup in July and August.

We'll go next to James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group.
James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Two, if I could. First of all, on the SAC in the U.S., could you just help us break down how much of the year-on-year change was SAC just [ph] spreading quasi fixed marketing across a smaller gross add base and how much was really higher variable costs and what might have been driving that? And secondly, now that you've -- that the baseball season's over, any take on the net impact of not having the Dodgers in L.A.? And does that inform your thoughts about the value of our sense in [ph] gen 2 in terms of customer churn and the like in general?
Patrick T. Doyle
Yes, James, on SAC. A couple of smaller things. I mean, first of all, we're starting to build in our home security business SAC and the LifeShield business. So that had an effect of -- year-over-year of $5, $6 just because it's kind of a new item and it's growing. I mean, the fixed SAC, again, was another kind of single-digit dollar increase from last year to this year. So on SAC, I mean, the real drivers were as we reacted to the competitive environment and Mike said, started to focus even more on the high-end customers, those tend to come with a higher price tag. And the example I would give you is the consumer electronics channel has been really good for us. We've grown that from low-single digits to almost double digits now. It's a much higher SAC. It includes us paying for in-store labor, but we get the highest-value customers out of that channel. So the more you focus and move away from some of the customers that Mike mentioned before and try to attract those higher-end customers, kind of by definition, it'll raise SAC when you look at the mix. So that's -- that was really the driver. Like I said, the -- just the fixed SAC and LifeShield are probably, between the 2 of them, are at $10 or $12 year-over-year. But the most of it was our focus on quality and energizing the sales channels.
Michael D. White
On the Dodgers, first of all, I just looked at the churn in the L.A. D of A [ph], and it was actually less than our total churn for the company in the quarter, and we do track it. It was pretty immaterial. I mean, I would say in the single-digit thousands and I would say, it wasn't in the high single-digit thousands. So look, we wanted to carry it. We planned to carry it, and that's part of how we had a kind of an unusual OPBDA [ph] quarter, I think, with the programming, which wasn't what we were planning. I mean, we actually planned it. We thought we made a fair offer that was more than the Dodgers got from all distributors combined last year and a significant increase over what we paid last year. It just wasn't something acceptable to Time Warner Cable. We will have, I'm sure, further discussions in the spring, and we're open to it. I think the biggest challenge for all of these is when you get to markets where there are 5 or 6 sports teams that the average customer has to pay for, if you took the Dodgers price, $35 a month is what the cost would be for sports. And without a sports tier, that's a significant tax on all customers that we don't think is right. But with that being said, look, we hope that there'll be some kind of compromise between the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable or Comcast next year, and we'll certainly, I'm sure, entertain further discussions at that time.

We'll go next to Tom Egan with Telsey Advisory Group.
Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Great. At least one pay TV provider is going to be offering a smaller OTT package soon. Michael, I was wondering, do you think that having 2 packages, one, say, large all-inclusive and one smaller, could be accretive to revenue?
Michael D. White
Well, I think, Tom, there's no question. And again, I'm being honest with you, if you looked at -- we track the -- what people say when they leave, when they churn out, right? And in the quarter, we saw a pretty significant increase in those that mentioned price value. So there's no question, I think, that customers -- there's a huge segment of customers that are looking for something certainly less than $100 a month, I mean, well less than that. Now whether that has to be $70, $50 or $30, I don't know, and how you get the right mix of content will be the key. But there's no doubt that there is a set of millennials that may not have a full bundle. I think, look, we're all in favor of choice. And I think giving the consumer a little more choice, I think, is a good thing. I think that the tricky part of it is not the technology. It's actually trying to get the right mix of channels because so many of them are all bundled together. It's hard to kind of say, "Well, gee, I just want channels that appeal to millennials." I mean, I could pick out the top 15 channels that'll appeal to millennials, but I don't think I could get them. But I think it's in all of our interests to give the consumer a little -- we don't have to go to Ã  la carte, I don't think that's in the industry's best interest, but a little more sensitivity to what the customers' paying and give them a little bit more flexibility to kind of choose something closer to the content that they want to watch. So we think it's an interesting opportunity. We're starting with a specialized kind of -- what I'll call like a specialized -- specialty magazine strategy of going after Hispanics, but we'll get some learnings out of that. And we continue to have different discussions about digital rights with all of our partners. And as that space evolves, we'll see if it's an interesting opportunity or not. I think, as I said, primarily, the challenge is "How do you fit the ACPU budget, if you will?" You probably can't do broadcast channels. And that's where it kind of gets funky because I'm not sure, without broadcast, the 4 -- the big 4 broadcast networks, how much demand there'll be. But it obviously depends on, I think, the quality of the content that's in the offering.

And we'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies.
Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Bruce, maybe you can just make a comment about the middle market push you guys started a couple of years back and just give us a sense for how it's sort of tracking versus your expectations. Churn in the quarter, obviously, was probably impacted by that 1/3 that are taking the prepaid product and FIFA to some degree as well. And then maybe, Mike, a comment just on the U.S., and you're talking about OTT and more on the millennial side. But when you think about the single product video and the need to take price, do we have a price elasticity problem here in the U.S. that's starting to build? That'd be great.
Bruce Barrett Churchill
Just starting on the middle market, look, we still obviously very strongly believe that for our product to succeed in Latin America, we need to be able to serve the mass market. Pay TV penetration in the A, B households is already very high. So the future growth is going to be about being able to serve profitably customers that are moving into the middle class or what would constitute middle class in Latin America. So I would say, in general, we're -- it has developed as we expected, and we're pleased with our progress. Having said that, I guess, I would had hoped to be maybe a little farther down the road on prepaid in Brazil. We tried going for a while without it. It's proven, as we've seen over the last year, to create some problems. And therefore, we have shifted more emphasis to the prepaid model in Brazil and hope that we achieve the same kind of success with prepaid in Brazil that we have achieved in PanAmericana because I just think that's a much better fit between their ability -- the customer's ability to pay and our ability to service them at a right kind of profit and return on investment level.
Michael D. White
Mike, yes, sure. I mean, I kind of think I've said it before. Unfortunately, we're a distributor. And if Walmart sells eggs and the cost of eggs goes up, the price of eggs goes up. And I think, as I've said, we expect probably our high water growth rate in ACPU to be next year. And therefore, we'll have to take additional pricing next year. And yes, I am concerned about it. I see that customers that are churning mentioning price value. I see more of them claiming they're going to no pay TV. It's not -- I mean, when you look at the total industry, you can't see it in the net add numbers, by the way, and so it's not -- I don't think it's kind of the end of the world here. But I do think it behooves all of us to recognize that, back to the -- one of the questions that was asked earlier, that to the extent you can find something for $50 a month, $70 a month, $35 a month, whatever that you could do on an everyday low price basis with customers, if you can make it a good product, certainly, we'll want to play there. But I do think -- yes, I think there is a concern for the industry as a whole, and that's why, sometimes, it's hard to read trends. A lot of you think that the trends are more technology or millennials or whatever. And I would argue, there's a much bigger issue, which is kind of the price elasticity challenge when you're trying to raise prices when median household incomes are flat, particularly for those making less than $50,000 a year.
Michael McCormack - Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I guess, just thinking about the number of substitutes in the marketplace, at what point do you think you can gain more leverage against the programmers to try to reduce that inflation?
Michael D. White
Probably when we get more churn. That's probably the reality.

We'll go next to -- with Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.
Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC
Mike, if maybe we could just stay with that theme for a second of price elasticity. You've actually been able to grow ARPU enough over the last couple of years and again this quarter to keep the gross profit per video subscriber pretty healthy, actually growing. But as your subscriber growth levels out, how sustainable do you think it is to keep that number rising since it requires a larger and larger annual price increase or whether it's price increase or DVR rental fees or what have you, but higher and higher ARPU growth in order to offset the inevitable rise in programming costs?
Michael D. White
Well, I don't -- look, first of all, I think this is still a terrific product that our industry sells to consumers. And I think it is probably the golden age of television, and the quality of stuff that is on from Ken Burns' 7-part series on the Roosevelts to Homeland or The Good Wife or The Americans on FX, you name it. I mean, there's probably more good quality programming than there's ever been, and I think we have to keep that in mind, Craig. But I'm not one who believes we have to kind of cut prices by 1/3 to sustain our business model, but I don't think it's sustainable to have content cost growing 8% to 10% a year, forcing price increases of 4% to 6% a year. I just don't think that's sustainable over time. But I would also tell you, and I think we've said this before, we certainly don't expect to be on the high end of that range other than next year. So there's no question that distributors, I think, are beginning to realize all of us that, man, these increases are just not something you can just keep doing. On the other hand, as a distributor, if the cost of content goes up, we negotiate as tough as we can to get a fair deal, consistent with the marketplace. But if the market speaks, then we have to pass that on to consumers. And ultimately, I think it'll be the consumer that will have to be the test on at what point the price versus the value equation gets further out of whack. But again, I can only tell you, the month of October looked good. So it's something to watch for us as an industry, I think. I don't think that double-digit content cost increases is sustainable but -- for the long haul. But as I said, we're not planning that either, so...

We'll go to Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.
Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I have 2 questions. We've talked kind of high level about over-the-top. I'm just curious, Mike, as to your reaction to the announcements from HBO and CBS and probably, soon to be, Showtime. And then secondly, are you in favor of complete unbundling and Ã  la carte or just smaller bundles?
Michael D. White
Well, I think, first, Marci, on your first question, look, I think we'll have to see. There's no question that all of us would like to have a product, and the content providers, I understand, would certainly like to get their content to be seen by probably 10 million homes, if you will, of millennial renters that don't take pay TV today. And so I don't have an issue with what they're trying to do, provided that there's no -- they don't price discriminate in a way that we're paying more and our customers have to pay more than they can get the product over-the-top, in which case, I think they create a problem. But I don't think they plan to do that. So we welcome more choice and access to content. And I think we do understand, with today's millennials, you're going to have to play both ways, both the linear and the digital, and we'll see how it goes. I think in terms of your second question, I don't think Ã  la carte is the way to go. It didn't work in Japan. I think you'll probably end up with less diversity of content if you went Ã  la carte. I just think it's like any good thing. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. And I think the bundles have gotten overdone. And I do think candidly that there are some areas, sports in particular, that probably should be on a separate tier but isn't. But that is what it is today. I'm just saying that -- to me, that's where I think it's -- it's particularly unfair for pay TV providers to have to pay for a lot of that sports content that they really don't want and don't watch, but that's kind of how the industry is today.

We'll go next to Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.
Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Questions. The first is on the same topic, which is how much leverage do you have in continuing the trend that you've seen in the programming cost this year? And are there other areas, like the Dodgers, for instance, now given that you've seen the kind of impact it has on your overall base [ph] that you see some scope for bringing down the cost? And related to that, I think you guys experimented with a whole tier for Regional Sports Networks and so on. So if you can share what you saw in terms of trends there, that would be pretty useful.
Michael D. White
Yes. I don't think we've experimented with a tier on our Regional Sports Networks per se. So I mean, I don't -- I think what we did do is some consumer research around the Houston situation to ask, particularly in some of the outer zones, whether consumers would pay anything for it, and 99% said no. That was kind of a unique situation as well, by the way, because the way they are incentive structured was picking up consumers in Oklahoma and Louisiana and other places that didn't really care about Houston. So I don't have any other data than I think our traditional thinking has been. On average, maybe 35% or 40% would take a Regional Sports Networks, but boy, you get to certain markets -- I'm from Boston, I bet it'd be higher than that. So it just -- it really depends. I think on the programming cost thing, look, we are taking a very careful look at all, and I think all distributors are, in terms of whether the actual channels' viewership comports with what we're paying for. And I would say, we certainly don't -- I mean, this year is not projectable in terms of ACPU. I think we were pretty clear on that. And frankly, even fourth quarter, you're going to see us right back, smack in the middle of our longer-term guidance of 7% to 9%. And I've said, next year, I expect to be above that. And -- but I don't expect that double-digit ACPU to be beyond next year. I think we're all kind of pushing hard to try and find ways to get to a more reasonable place with our programming partners in terms of what their demands are, but that's a negotiation and that's the marketplace, and we'll have to see how that evolves.

And we'll take Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Mike, you didn't mention the NFL this quarter as a reason or a factor in your sub result. I'm just curious how that performed versus your expectations. There was some PR noise around the NFL, negative noise, earlier parts of the season. And second, you and Pat talked about fourth quarter subscriber trends, but there was a caveat around programming disputes. The one that everyone knows about is the Disney. I just wanted to see if you had any update on your Disney process.
Michael D. White
Yes, Ben, the Disney negotiations are continuing. I think they've been very constructive. Those -- a deal like Disney is multi-headed process when you're thinking about digital and all the other stuff, but we're quite pleased with the progress that we're making on that. They've been good partners. As I think you saw, the SEC network was -- we've put it up, and that was an agreement with the Disney company. And so I'm very optimistic that we will complete that negotiation. In terms of the NFL, I appreciate your asking, actually, we were pretty pleased with the NFL. I probably should have mentioned it, but we saw a 10% increase in the customers paying, which is a good thing because we do use it as a first-year kind of free trial, if you will. So we got a 10% increase there. We had kind of -- renewal's up 5%. New regular-season takers that hadn't taken it before was up 23%. And then the new over-the-top broadband service was small, about 40,000 customers, but we got some really good learnings there. And so overall, we expect the cash that we get from paying subs to increase 13% when all was said and done for the 2014 season. So I'm really pleased with it. I think the impact on gross adds as a free trial element was probably more muted, to be honest with you. But there were so many other things going on in the quarter, as I said, overlaps versus prior year and what have you that I'm not sure that I could read anything into that one way or the other. All I can tell you is we're really pleased. We were pleased to get our deal done. It's been a 20-year partnership. We value the relationship with the league, and we were pleased with our paying customers increasing this year by 10%, revenues being up 13%. So that's really good.
