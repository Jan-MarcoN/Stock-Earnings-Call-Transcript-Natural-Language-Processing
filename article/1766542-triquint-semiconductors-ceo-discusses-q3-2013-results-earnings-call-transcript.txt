Good afternoon. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the TriQuint Semiconductor Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakersâ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.
And Mr. Brown, you may begin your conference.
Grant Brown - Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2013 conference call. I am Grant Brown, Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Ralph Quincy, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Steve Buhaly, our Chief Financial Officer.
During the call, we will make forward-looking statements about TriQuintâs business and projected financial results. Actual results could differ materially from our projections based on various risk factors including those described in the press release we issued earlier today and our reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All financial measures presented in todayâs call are on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures report tax on a cash basis and exclude equity compensation charges, entries associated with acquisitions and other specifically identified non-routine items. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance understanding of our core operating performance. A full reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is in our press release and in the Investors section of our website.
I will now turn the call over to Ralph to provide an overview of the quarter.
Ralph Quincy - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Grant and good afternoon everyone. I will start with a brief overview of our third quarter results, including comments on our markets and products. Steve will follow with a detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and Q4 guidance. I will then make a few closing comments and open the call for questions.
I am pleased with our overall results in Q3. We successfully executed a significant revenue ramp and generated meaningful profit improvement. Specifically, we delivered record third quarter revenue of $250.8 million growing more than 30% sequentially and nearly 25% over the same quarter last year. Our net income of $0.16 per share exceeded July guidance by $0.06, a substantial improvement over last quarter and last year. Additionally, we continued to execute on key development projects that maintained a high level of new product output completing 45 new products in the quarter and over 130 year-to-date.
Our persistent emphasis on execution and value creation has positioned TriQuint at the forefront of the changing RF industry. As we look forward, crowded spectrum, carrier aggregation and the expanding adoption of LTE places mobile wireless in the spotlight as our largest opportunity and validates our long-term focus on filters and dense RF integration. In particular, we expect the market for premium filters to double in the next two years becoming a $2 billion opportunity in 2016. In preparation, we have added capacity and have accelerated the development of filter-based products both discrete and integrated. Core to our strategy, we leverage our substantial technology portfolio targeting products that drive value for our customers. For example, the recent acquisition of CAP Wireless with their Spatium products will leverage TriQuintâs strong position in gallium nitride with very high power solid sate amplifiers that deliver better reliability, efficiency, power density and bandwidth than tube-based solutions in the market today.
Within mobile devices, our emphasis on premium filters and high efficiency broadband amplifiers is intersecting with growing LTE demand. Crowded spectrum, expanding band count, coexistence issues and the desire for longer battery life will drive the need for premium filters and high efficiency broadband amplifiers for years to come. The adoption of carrier aggregation, which creates additional band co-existence issues, is also a tailwind to companies like TriQuint that supply premium filters. The average number of filters in the smartphone has more than doubled in the last few years and will double again in the neck two years. This is creating a strong push towards integrated modules that combine premium filtering with broadband amplifiers to reduce RF size and complexity in a phone. This requirement for simplified RF is a TriQuintâs strength, particularly when solution size, product performance and assurance of supply are key customer goals.
Turning specifically to our infrastructure and defense product line performance in the quarter. Our revenues were up 6% year-to-date as compared to 2012 excluding non-strategic foundry, where we have restricted competitive access to some of our advanced technology, total infrastructure and defense revenues were up 12% with networks up 4%, defense up 28% in Q3 as compared to Q3 last year. The strength in defense comes primarily from airborne radar, which is up 50% year-to-date. Program timing, increased content in radar systems and more radar products are driving the revenue increase. Despite the recent drama during the government shutdown and persistent defense spending concerns, we continue to benefit from longstanding well-funded programs. Examples of these programs include JSF, TPQ-53 and radar upgrade programs targeting large international fleets of F-16s and FA-18s.
In infrastructure, we saw healthy demand for base station products in support of the TV, LTE build-out in China. We expect continued strength for these products in Q4. Additionally in optical, an inventory correction in Q3 appears to be winding down with stronger Q4 demand for our high performance optical drivers. Mobile devices had a very strong quarter with revenues up 53% sequentially and 43% year-over-year driven by demand for new LTE products and a significant product ramp in the quarter. Over 200 operators in more than 75 countries will have launched LTE services by the end of this year, but we believe LTE is in the early stages of transition with only about 20% handset penetration. LTE expansion represents our single largest growth driver over the next several years. To understand the growth case, itâs important to note that all parties involved have a vested interest in the success of LTE. Carriers see a lower cost per bid coupled with higher ARPU. Handset vendors capitalize on hardware upgrades. Consumers benefit from noticeably better feeder rates and a new industry is created around broadband mobile applications.
The proliferation of LTE across the globe creates numerous opportunities for TriQuint. The latest high-end smartphones have seen the number of bands double from the prior generation. Additionally, a number of these incremental frequency bands not only require premium filters for LTE, but also must have filtering to support co-existence of low band WiFi and LTE in the same handset. These coexistence filters are one of our fastest growing opportunities. Although some of our products are incredibly small, less than 2 millimeters on a side and too small to carry a logo, these products represent a decade long BAW effort to move from development to full scale production. Additionally, these discrete products we build and sell today represent the building blocks for future integrated modules.
TriQuint has amassed a considerable amount of intellectual property related to both the design and manufacture of BAW filters and our pace of innovative is accelerating. Furthermore, significant investments in dense packaging technologies such as wafer level packaging and our copper flip interconnect have enabled TriQuint to deliver products, important factors that allow customers to produce smaller and thinner phones. These capabilities now set us apart from our traditional competition. We have broad expertise in premium filters, dense packaging capability and benchmark efficiency for broadband amplifiers. Given the challenge with LTE, WiFi co-existence and carrier aggregation, the playing field is changing and the market is moving towards our strength.
Steve will now provide a detailed financial review of the quarter and outlined our guidance for the fourth quarter.
Steven Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Ralph. For the third quarter of 2013, revenue was $250.8 million, up 25% from the third quarter of 2012 and up 32% sequentially. Mobile devices increased 53% sequentially while networks declined 11% and defense was up 11%. The decline in networks was largely driven by reduction, their non-strategic foundry business. For the third quarter, our end market revenue split was 72% for mobile devices, 16% for network infrastructure and 12% for defense and aerospace. Please refer to the supplemental data posted on the Investors section of website for a more detailed breakdown and the trend of our revenue by market.
During the third quarter, Foxconn Technology Group and ProTech Corp accounted for 35% and 13% of our revenue respectively. Please note the Foxconn and ProTech are subcontract assemblers and high volume electronics companies may use multiple subcontractors to build their products and the mix of those firms may vary over time.
Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.11. Gross margin was 38.0% for the third quarter, up sequentially from 31.3%. Higher revenue and activity levels drove the improved margin. Better product mix and efficient management of the ramp in production also contributed to improved margins. Operating expenses were $68.6 million for the third quarter of 2013, down 1.0 million from the prior quarter as we continue to manage expenses closely. Tax expense for the third quarter was negligible.
Net income for the third quarter was $26.3 million or $0.16 per share. Total cash and investments decreased by $62.4 million to $26.9 million during the third quarter. Drivers of the decline were repayment of the $20 million balance on our revolver and a $75 million increase in accounts receivable due to growth in revenue and timing of shipments within the quarter. While the AR balance is high, I do not see any change to our historically very low exposure to bad debt risk. Capital expenditures of $20.8 million were well below quarterly deprecation and primarily for premium filters.
Moving to our financial outlook, we believe fourth quarter revenues will be between $260 million and $270 million. Gross margin is expected to be between 35% and 36% as the factories slowdown a bit in anticipation of a seasonally weaker Q1. Operating expenses are expected to be between $70 million and $72 million. Fourth quarter net income per diluted share is expected to be between $0.12 and $0.14 per diluted share. In addition, we currently expect to take a fourth quarter non-cash charge of $20 million to $25 million as we reduce our gas capacity to better align with projected demand for this process technology. As of today, we are 88% booked, the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance.
On the investor relations front, we are looking forward to see many of you at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day the morning of October 31 in New York. Space was limited, but the event will be webcast and please look for a press release next week with further details. The presentation materials would be made available on the Investors section of our website just prior to the event. We do not have any scheduled conferences during the fourth quarter, but will be attending the 16th Annual Needham Growth Conference in New York January 14 through 16. Our Q4, 2013 conference call is schedule for February 5, 2014.
I will now turn the call over to Ralph for closing comments after which we will open the call to your questions.
Ralph Quincy - President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks Steve. TriQuint with an emphasis on the integration that includes both active and filtering components was one of the first RF companies to participate in the 3G RF expansion between 2006 and 2011. We grew rapidly and our successful strategy outpaced our installed capacity resulting in a revenue stream that plateaued in 2012. We used that time to reposition the company for the next and larger LTE wave of expansion by focusing on performance and size.
As I highlighted earlier we have retooled our factories and aligned our mobile product strategy around premium filters, high efficiency amplifiers and densely integrated solutions. In our non-mobile markets we continue to be the technology and performance leader. We believe in leveraging differentiated in-house capability into highly integrated RF solutions which sets us apart from traditional suppliers in the market today. We offer a compelling value propositions to the customers that we believe competitions will struggle to match. We are leader in the RF solutions market and I expect to leverage our leadership into revenue growth and overall improved financial performance.
Jennifer, we now would like to take questions. Jennifer?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Edward Snyder (Charter Equity Research).
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Steve, with regards to December period, it seems a little bit light here historically I guess networks is about 7% up and defense about 16%, can we expect that or is the move away from non-strategic foundry was responsible for kind of little bit weaker on the revenue line and how do you see mobile shaping out for next quarter?
Steve Buhaly
So if I understood your question that you were breaking up at the beginning, going forward we see some growth with the mobile devices. We see growth with optical and we see growth with base stations. Maybe you can re-ask the rest of your question.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Sure, so specifically I was speaking of the December quarter guidance which looks a little light and if you look at historically what the other divisions have done, network 7%, defense 6% sequentially in that period. Can we expect similar growth rates for those divisions, leaving most of the slowdown in mobile or is the move away from non-strategic foundry work impacting networks again next quarter?
Steve Buhaly
The compares for same quarter year-over-year will impact the networks business. The non-strategic foundry, we did about $30 million in 2012. We will do about $15 million this year and most of that $15 million is behind us already.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
So how is mobile shaping up for December, I mean in terms of your guidance are you looking at a little bit lighter, it sounds like?
Steve Buhaly
We are expecting growth in our revenue in Q4 and we are expecting growth from all of our major customers.
Ralph Quincy
Like some of our other friends in the business we do see some decline with the Blackberry business.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Right, you are fairly large with Blackberry is thatâs probably where youâre weakest, will that be fair to say in the December period. I mean weâve heardâ¦
Ralph Quincy
Yes, I think thatâs the case.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Okay and can you give us a feel for all or how much revenue you might be doing with them last say in the June period?
Ralph Quincy
So if you look to any particular quarter they have been in our top three or four customers this year and now they have really fallen off the map.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Okay and then finally, in terms of the filter business now, Ralph you had said that you will look at capacity again at the beginning of 2014 and decide then whether that capacity is something like some of your earlier comments suggest that things are growing little more brisk than you expected. Have you changed your approach to CapEx in filters and what kind of mix is that in general that must be gaining share on your total mix for mobile at this point?
Ralph Quincy
So I would say the answer to mix, filters or filter related revenue is going up and we expect that to continue. It probably represents somewhere in the range of 30 or it will maybe a little higher than that percentage of our total revenue within mobile devices. We will add selected capacity where we needed. I think we are in pretty good shape right now. But we are continuing to look at areas in specifically BAW and temperature comps that you say the SAW are the two areas where if we â we will have to add capacity, those are the two areas we would add.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Okay and that was â this is my last question, your share with Samsung on the previous yearâs model has not been that large, how do you feel is shaping up in the 2014 with the new model? Do you think the move to LTE in the international markets gives you better positioning there, do you feel you will do better on that platform than you have in the past, any color at all on that?
Ralph Quincy
I do believe we will do better than we have in the past with Samsung. Keep in mind we are growing this year with Samsung. We saw little bit of a step back in Q3 but I think that was more due to overall unit demand. I think we continued to have good success with premium filters and with our broadband MMPAs. I believe we will grow sequentially with Samsung in Q4 and itâs really too soon to comment on Q1. But I feel good about our overall position with Samsung next year as compared to this year.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Great, thanks.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays Capital.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital
Maybe just a follow-up on prior question, the outside of rim, rims on issues, do you see any sort of other inventory management from other customers or just any comments on just the overall handset market into Q4? Thanks.
Ralph Quincy
From a handset perspective, no specific issues that I can talk about. I would say that there is a lot of volatility also in the handset space. So any one point in time, things can change radically. I think that the overall market is still a growth market. I think that the customers we are relying with which was big, long list of characters with the right people to be aligned with. And I think that we are going to have a very successful year next year driven on the strength as I said of premium filters, requirement for additional premium filters and the fact that we have now able quite a few high efficiency broadband MMPA products.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital
Got you. Maybe a question for Steve, the charge for removing the gas capacity, so you could talk about are you taking a write-down on that fab capacity and how does that play with gross margin going forward? Thanks.
Steve Buhaly
Yes, we are taking a write-down on some of our gas capacity. And I expect that will reduce depreciation in subsequent quarters by about between $1.5 million to $2 million a quarter.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital
Got you. Okay guys, thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Steve Smigie (Raymond James & Associates).
Steve Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
Okay, thanks a lot. And I would say congratulations on a pretty big ramp and you are guiding up here I know maybe a little disappointing relative to history, but still a guide up of a pretty big ramp. I was just curious about looking out to Q1 and I was hoping you could talk about what you might be thinking there you had a comparable yesterday, you talk about down sort of seasonal levels. Is that sort of what you are thinking at this point?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, still too early to talk about Q1. Our expectations is that next year should look a lot like last year.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
Okay. And just in terms of â you mentioned some TD LTE business, can you talk about how those orders are looking to you at this point? Does it seem like you are having a pretty meaningful ramp at this point past trial periods meaningful ramp of actual production systems and has that slowed or is it about where you would think it would be?
Ralph Quincy
So itâs quite strong. We have seen that business climbing throughout the year. The build-out in China is driving it and itâs going to be significantly up by, I think we are up in the range of 50% to 70% year-to-date.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
Okay, great. And then just curious if you could give some color on how you expect to see gross margin ramping over the next 12 months. I had obviously some utilization, but given the mix of the new products how should we think about that relative to your gross margin targets?
Steve Buhaly
I think it has two factors. One is the seasonality. We typically have a much stronger second half. And so I think you will see as there is these typical margins are their lowest in Q1 and strongest either in Q3 or Q4 depending on where the factory activity is heaviest. But I think there is every chance of having a year in the mid to upper 30s and I think the second half could be 40, we will see.
Steve Smigie - Raymond James & Associates
Great. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss (Craig-Hallum Capital Group).
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group
Questions, Ralph, more on BAW filters, if you could give us a sense of what percentage of your overall mobile business it is and what you see kind of growth rates for 2014? And also specific to BAW, give us a sense on yields as you are ramping capacity here, are you running into any issues on the yield side thatâs also hampering gross margins? Thanks.
Ralph Quincy
No significant yield issues, actually yields are running quite nicely for BAW-related products and mobile. If you look at just our mobile revenue and try to breakout between BAW revenue versus everything out, itâs a difficult number to come to, because in many cases, the BAW capability is integrated into a complex module to lot of other technologies into it, but if you stand back and just try to look at that, it represents in the range of 30% of our mobile devices revenue with a growing number of products in the discrete side of that in addition to our traditional PA duplexers. And I expect that percentage of revenue to increase next year. I think there is faster growth in the filter side of the market. We are releasing more products everyday and we see high demand from our customers for some key products as I mentioned the co-existence filters and some of the more difficult LTE bands.
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group
Okay. And then lastly, if you can talk a little bit about just linearity of the quarter, you are taking about a drop in gross margins as you slow ahead of Q4, just love to hear your view on kind of how it shakes out between October, November, December? Thanks.
Steve Buhaly
I donât think we have a good view on revenue linearity in Q4. I think that lot will depend on the holiday season. Q3 was quite back loaded. I expect Q4 to be a more typical quarter.
Anthony Stoss - Craig-Hallum Capital Group
Alright, thanks Steve.
Steve Buhaly
Yes.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton (Needham & Company).
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company
Hi Ralph, Steve, congratulations on the strong ramp in the nice margin improvement. Ralph just wanted to start on the filter side, you talked about the big opportunity for Wi-Fi coexistence, filters and wondering if that product is already now in high volume production or is really that a driver as you look out to 2014/2015.?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, product is already in high volume production, millions of dollars of revenue from our discrete products and that product in particular has multiple customers or same design wins. We probably have design wins for our products across I would say 10 customers now.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company
Thatâs specifically for the Wi-Fi coexistence?
Ralph Quincy
Thatâs probably the one that has most penetration, multiple customers. I donât know at the top if I had the number exactly, but multiple customers probably in the range of 5 to 8 customers.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company
Okay, great. And then the second question just you mentioned the carrier aggregation requiring more advanced filters, if you look at a phone with carrier aggregation versus upon without carrier aggregation, I donât know that it actually adds additional filters, but it sounds like the performance requirements are more stringent. Is there an ASP bump that you can provide us or an ASP bump range? What you might get on a premium filter for carrier aggregation versus filters that might be used today in non-carrier aggregation LTE devices?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, tough question. The issue with carrier aggregations you have non-traditional bands being active at the same time and it creates coexistence issues. It also creates requirement for better filtering capabilities. Now, a typical filter in a commodity socket thatâs built on saw products might sell for something in the range of $0.15 to $0.20. As I have mentioned in the past, coexistence filters and some of the BAW related bands, we are talking about sell for two to three, four times the amount. So it really depends upon the characteristics of the filtering problem you are trying to solve.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company
Okay, great. And then just lastly for Steve, it looks like the primary reason for the step down in gross margins in the December quarter is really slower or slowing of the facts ahead of seasonal decline in the first half. Is there on top of that or embedded in that seasonal or that downtick any expectations to reduce inventory on hand?
Steve Buhaly
Yes, there is, I expect weâll see a reduction and it could be as much as $20 million too soon to say, but I do expect to see some inventory reduction in the period.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Company
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of James Faucette (Pacific Crest Securities).
James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities
Thank you very much. A couple of questions from me. First, I wanted to kind of hit on the balance sheet, obviously a lot of cash usage this quarter, but it looks like most of that went to accounts receivable and inventories, is that the primary thing that we should be looking at as far as the cash draw down just the late ramp in the quarter and the resulting impact on some of those other accounts.
Steve Buhaly
Yes, you are mostly right. Cash came down for two big reasons. One is we repaid the $20 million balance in our revolver in the third quarter and then accounts receivable grew by about $75 million partly due to revenue growth, partly due to poor linearity. Inventory was only up about $5 million, so that was pretty negligible as a driver. And I expect that linearity to work itself out in the fourth quarter. And in fact overall I think Q2 will be a great cash flow from operations quarter. I think, you could be $80 million, $90million maybe even $100 million of cash flow from ops as we kind of catch up with working capital in the quarter. So I think it will be a good quarter for cash and Q3 we really grew accounts receivable as a primary use of cash.
James Faucette - Pacific Crest Securities
Great. And then I just wanted to go back to kind of comments about how to think about exiting this calendar year and prepping for 2014, I think you Ralph you made the comment that you saw that 2014 could look similar to 2013 in terms of season, or similar to that previous year in terms of seasonality, were you referring to 2012 or 2013 and I guess similar â along the same lines is as we are trying to think about 2014, if we are expecting gross margins to come down a bit as we ramp down in the December quarter should we expect gross margins and hence our earnings to be a little bit weaker in the first half of the year and then with better results in the later part of the year as new high end or higher profile and larger volume products refresh and ramp back up? Thank you very much.
Steve Buhaly
I think largely you are on track. Ralphâs comment referred to 2013 in terms of our seasonality driven partly by holiday seasonality, partly by the mix of products and customers we have. I do believe gross margins will be probably lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third or fourth quarter like they were this year. But overall 2014 should be a growth year and should be a better year for us. In terms of seasonality I think you are on the right lines.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of JoAnne Feeney (ABR Investment Strategy).
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
Hi, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Could we get back to the issue of reducing capacity, I am wondering if part of the reason is a shift in mix to more discrete filters perhaps and less modules and perhaps lest PA in your mix, can you comment on how you see that mix shaping up over the next year?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, to be specific. We have been investing in BAW capacity and as it turns out some of the equipment is fungible between BAW capacity and our gas capacity and so we have been moving that equipment over, that does leave some standard equipment that we have taken off the books, just to balance the overall line.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
And so going forward do you expect the filters, the bar filters to be sold more and more as discrete or more in terms of modules and how does your capacity decision.
Ralph Quincy
I think we should â we will sell both the capacity that we are talking about is largely wafer capacity. So it really does impact the packaging from that part of that decision JoAnne.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
Okay, okay and thenâ¦.
Steve Buhaly
JoAnne you know that the larger picture is some gas capacity used to produce switches is moving SOI, MMPAs, use less real estate than discrete. So the broader trend lines are driving a little bit of a reduced demand.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
Perfect. Thanks a lot and then as a follow-up, what is the potential for TriQuint in tablets in particular we have seen tablets come out now with more and more LTE capabilities on the data side and I am wondering what the possibilities are there and if there is a demand there for BAW filters?
Ralph Quincy
Absolutely, all things wireless we consider are opportunity and by and large if you look at a tablet or a smartphone if it has RF connectivity, either 4G, 3G or Wi-Fi, it looks very much the same to TriQuint and we sell by and larger the same devices.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
And so could you perhaps, youâve done a good job of giving us a sense of how much growth we could expect for this year. Can you give us a sense for next year at all and perhaps what the mix would be of dollar content gains versus participation in the aggregate growth of the RF market?
Ralph Quincy
So I think the overall market is growing at about 10% to 15% rate and weâre increasing â we would like to increase faster than the market. We think that we are back on a growth train, second half of this year. We do have seasonality. I think the compares will look good and we will continue to expand our presence again built on premium filters and MMPAs.
JoAnne Feeney - ABR Investment Strategy
Okay, thatâs all for me. Thanks.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley (Canaccord Genuity).
Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity
Thank you. Just to follow-up on some of the other questions, can you maybe help us size Blackberry for you in terms of how much they might be down sequentially just to get a feel for how that non-Blackberry customers are doing. I think we all know whatâs going on with Blackberry right now?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, I would say that in a peak quarter that was a double digit customer and thatâs ramped down to probably mid-single digit customer in the most recent quarter.
Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity
Okay, great. Thank you. And then Steve how should we think about with some of the growth drivers looking into next year, kind of your OpEx plans, did you guys have the cost structure in line or do you think you need to add to it next year or can it come down?
Steve Buhaly
Well I think a reasonable expectation is a very modest growth in OpEx. We have been talking about $1 million a quarter growth on average. You will see that wobble around a little bit with random events. But I think itâs going to be very modest growth if you thought about it as a inflation level, you would probably be okay.
Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity
Okay, great and then last for me and I will pass on, is just on the networks business, how much is left in foundry and how should we be think about some of the trends in that business maybe with some of these LTE builds, is that in area you see this business starting to recover into next year?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, to be clear we still do focus high single digits 10% of our revenue in foundry, the business that we backed away from some time ago now is non-strategic foundry. Our legacy has been as a technology provider in over the last five, ten years we have sold to virtually all of our competitors and over the last three to four years, we have discontinued and ramped down that non-strategic foundry business. And in 2012 that business was maybe $30 million, this year it is approximately $15 million. Those were the tails of end of life buys that you see in 2012 or in the first part of 2013 and we are trying to ramp that down to zero.
Mike Walkley - Canaccord Genuity
Okay, okay thatâs helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of David Duley (Steelhead Securities).
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
Quick housekeeping question from me, could you just throw out the utilization number of the factories in Q3 and what you expect in Q4?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, so wealth utilizations were similar to the previous quarter. We are probably in the mid to high-60s depending on how you measure. We measure it by equipment utilization, but as mix changes and other factors moving around, you get some variability, but it feels like we are about mid-60s utilized.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
And what would you expect in the fourth quarter?
Ralph Quincy
We will likely take utilization down in the third quarter as we move into our seasonal period.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
Okay, and in the past you talked about the increasing content in filters between 3G and LTE phones, could you just remind us what you would, I know its hard to pick an average phone, but just kind of what is the dollar content increase there so we can gauge how fast your filter business should grow over the next couple of years?
Ralph Quincy
I guess in very high level terms, is about $3 of added content largely driven by the addition of those LTE bands that require high performance filtering. Now the total filtering content is higher in the phone and we have got a pretty good graphic on our website if you want to pull that down but weâre focused on that premium content.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
And so with a $3 increase, can you just give us the base number?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, base number being zero on a 3G phone, rough numbers, $3 to $4 dollar increase.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
Okay, thank you. And then when you look at your BAW filter business, as people been asking, if you expect the mix to change more towards the discrete products and can you give us an idea now of what level of discrete BAW filters you are producing?
Ralph Quincy
Yes. So based on our product releases, we are seeing an increase in discrete products. We are probably going to ramp pretty quickly up to of our mobile devices business, maybe 20% of our revenue or more coming from discrete products. And I think that will increase over time. Thatâs because typically with a wide number of customers, the solutions initially are discrete to offer those as discrete solutions. And over time, there is a tendency to integrate, to reduce complexity and reduce size and those discretes now become building blocks for the integration. So you will see the discretes I think as a percent of revenue jump up, but over several years you will see it then reintegrate.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
Okay. And final question from me is, is the gross margins better on the filter business versus the power amplifier business or how should we think about that over the next couple of years whatever the mix is that you assume?
Ralph Quincy
Yes. So for some of our products, it varies by products, but for some of our products like that coexistence filters that we sell to a broad range of customers, the margins are quite good, because itâs a high-performance solution and there is not a lot of supply out in the world for it. There is not many people that can offer the type of solution with the performance that we offer. So in those cases, where we add value we do enjoy better margins.
David Duley - Steelhead Securities
Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of (Drew Burke).
Drew Burke
Good quarter. Good execution guys. I just had a couple of questions and one clarification. With regards to the gross margin you are getting 38%, you are close to that 40% target and I think a little ahead of plan on the revenue side. So could you kind of go over again what you think you are â at what level of revenues you are going to hit, you think you will hit the 40% gross margin target? And then I also have a clarification with regards to the comments you made about this year looking like last year of Q1, were you talking about Q1 2012 or Q1 2013?
Ralph Quincy
So we were talking â when I made the comment, we are talking about next year looking a lot like this year, first half, second half kind of comparisons. Things move around and go to boundaries, but we got a pretty similar first half, second half type of comparison 2014 to 2013.
Drew Burke
Okay. So you are not necessarily saying sequential from Q4 to Q1 as much as you are saying first half, second half total mix?
Ralph Quincy
Little early to guide for Q1, we will give you more specific guidance at the next call, but in general first half, second half, it looks like there is a pattern there.
Drew Burke
Okay. And then with regards to the gross margin question?
Steve Buhaly
With respect to gross margins, we are certainly in the right circumstance, could hit 40% at $300 million in revenue maybe even a bit less, right. Q3 tends to be a good gross margin period, because we are not only building for busy Q3, we are building for our busy Q4. Q4 sometimes is a little bit less. So it depends on both what the factory is building for as well as the revenue levels in the quarter, but certainly in that $275 million to $300 million, we could hit 40% with respectable mix and activity levels in the factories?
Drew Burke
And then where do you feel that capacity is at now, quarterly?
Steve Buhaly
Pardon me.
Drew Burke
Quarterly revenue capacity then, what do you feel like you could do?
Steve Buhaly
We are still in the $400 million range again with all sorts of caveats around mix.
Drew Burke
Right. And then just the last thing to book-to-bill that 1.11 looked pretty good relative to the revenue guidance, which is brought at $10 million sequentially. Could you give us a little insight into that?
Steve Buhaly
Yes, I think there is plenty of variability. There are some bookings in Q3 or for Q3 some are in Q4, I will just say that often bookings are a little less robust as you go through the fourth quarter and get into the holiday season. So I wouldnât attribute too much too that I think itâs just a little randomness and a little bit of Q3 versus Q4.
Drew Burke
Okay, thank you.
Steve Buhaly
You bet.

And your next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder (Charter Equity Research).
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
It is a follow-up. Ralph, just to be clear, you are exiting September quarter, you have about by $15 million in non-strategic foundry business going to zero by when?
Ralph Quincy
Didnât give that specifics, so let me walk through it again. And in 2012 in total, we had about $30 million in non-strategic revenue, non-strategic foundry revenue. In 2013, we expect the full year to be in the range of $15 million. We think the large part of that is behind us. So itâs fairly low right now.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Thatâs for the year and not for the quarter.
Ralph Quincy
Yes for the year.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Well, I thought we are talking about month-to-month, so itâs not 15 a month.
Ralph Quincy
Thatâs fair, 2012 to 2013 and most of the $15 million is behind us.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Right. And then you said BlackBerry was in the mid single-digits in September, is that mid single-digit revenue as a percent of consolidated or mobile or what? Whatâsâ¦
Ralph Quincy
Mid single in millions of dollars.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Okay. And then in terms of filters, you are shipping TC-SAW now, was that correct introduction and any feeling at all on the mix you are still very heavily weighted towards BAW and you are not shipping SAW as a product, right, I mean you are consuming it, but you are not shipping out, so most of your filter business is just BAW?
Ralph Quincy
Almost, totally correct. The larger market is BAW compared to TC-SAW. Both of those we classify as premium filter products and we are shipping both in significant volumes. We do also still build and integrate some SAW components into some of our integrated modules, thatâs the beauty of the strategy, where we could address virtually any opportunity of RF integration, because we have other components as you know amplifiers, switches, filtering whether itâs premium filtering or commodity filtering. We really donât emphasize the commodity filters and we donât sell those discretely as we do with some of the other filters, the premium filters, but it is a nice add in to allow us to address some very attractive opportunities that maybe dominated by gallium arsenide or BAW or TC-SAW, but having that extra soft capability allows you to address socket.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
And then you have mentioned the wideband gas, MMPAs are maybe one in the same broadband MMPAs. Is that into the QUALCOMM reference design or I know Samsung is obviously using that in architecture for the GS4 and itâs going to be for the GS5? Where do you see yourselves strongest, I know you had a win I think at Lenovo earlier, is it going in the QUALCOMM reference design, is it being designed in individually by larger OEMs, where can we expect to see TriQuint's part show up?
Ralph Quincy
Yes. We expect to have our part show up with multiple chipset partners including the largest, including those chips and suppliers are a captive to some of our customers. And so we have got a fairly broad-based product portfolio that addresses multiple chipset partners.
Edward Snyder - Charter Equity Research
Great, thanks guys.

And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya (Bank of America/Merrill Lynch).
Anne Edelstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Hey guys. This is Anne Edelstein calling in for Vivek. So couple of questions I think lot of its been covered, but on the ball market side, I think in the past you have said that you have somewhere between 25% and 30% of that market? Do you have any updates perhaps on that assumption was the recent ramps that we have seen this quarter? And then maybe just if you could highlight what you are seeing in, in terms of the competitive landscape and BAW filters outside of where you and Avago participate if there are any up and coming competitors?
Ralph Quincy
Yes. We still see our primary competitor in BAW is Avago. I think the market is growing quite rapidly. We really donât track share that closely, because itâs a growth market. So I really have an update for probably the numbers we gave you before, difficult number to pay because there is not really a lot of third-party tracking in this market either, but itâs probably still a pretty good number, but itâs more about a growth story than a share story for us right now. There are other suppliers out there. We still see them as distant in capabilities, but we havenât stopped innovating. We continued to improve our technology and we continued to get great feedback from our customers and they continued to value it.
Anne Edelstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Thatâs helpful. And then just quickly on the China handset market. We have some mix data from your other competitors. Could you provide some color on what you are seeing going on there, is there excess inventory, is that sort of the issue or whatever you might have to provide?
Ralph Quincy
As far as the China market dominated by 2G phones or entry-level phones, now are only entry-level phones in 3G. Other than a little bit of exposure for those co-existence filters, we just donât have a lot of exposure to that market yet. That market is moving towards our strategy. I would say they are not quite there yet. I think over time we will have more exposure driven to the very low end of the market driven by those WiFi coexist filters. But we are not really targeting that the low end of the market right now.
Anne Edelstein - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Thanks guys.

And our last question comes from the line of (JR Miller).
JR Miller
Hi guys. Do you see Samsung being a 10% or more customer of year next year?
Ralph Quincy
I think thatâs certainly in the mix. I think thatâs certainly a reasonable expectation.
JR Miller
And talking about Chinese handset makers, next year Xiaomi wants to start selling their phones globally, do we provide any components to their phones now or do we have any talks with yet?
Ralph Quincy
Yes, we are engaged with them now. We do supply parts to them.
JR Miller
Alright, excellent. Thank you, guys.
Ralph Quincy
Okay.
Operator
And we have no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the call back over to Ralph Quincy.
Ralph Quincy - President and Chief Executive Officer
