Welcome to JMP Group's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that todayâs call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Andrew Palmer, the company's Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Palmer
Good morning. Here with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP Groupâs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Jackson, the company's Chief Financial Officer. We're joined by Carter Mack, President of JMP Group; and Mark Lehmann, President of JMP Securities.
Before we get started, I'll note that some of this morning's comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP's control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of the uncertainties that could affect the companyâs future performance, please see the description of risk factors included in our most recent 10-K.
With that, I'll turn things over to our Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.
Joe Jolson
Thanks Andrew. Our third quarter results were disappointing, but not entirely unexpected given the sharp sell-off from smaller cap U.S. equities during the latter half of the period, which hurt our investment banking business and led to modest losses on net invested capital and our funds versus our expectation of more normalized returns.
For the quarter, our taxable operating subsidiaries produced all of our operating earnings, while our corporate net income line, which is net investment income less corporate costs, was essentially breakeven.
Our operating return on equity was disappointing under 4% for the quarter, but for the latest 12 months is still roughly 12%. Iâll have Ray Jackson touch on some financial highlights before I continue. Ray?
Ray Jackson
Thanks, Joe. Adjusted net revenues which exclude certain non-cash items and non-controlling interest were $27.1 million, down from $39.7 million for the third quarter of 2014. Decline was primarily due to year-over-year decreases of $3.3 million in hedge fund incentive fees and $5.1 million in investment banking revenues. Operating net income was $1.3 million or $0.06 per share, down from $3.4 million or $0.15 per share a year ago. The nine months ended September, operating EPS was $0.50 compared to $0.52 for the first nine months of 2014.
As for expenses, we consider our compensation and non-compensation ratios. Our adjusted compensation ratio excludes two items: First, any hiring costs related to strategic growth initiatives, though there have been none to-date in 2015; second, any hedge fund incentive fees since the majority of such fees is passed through to the investment team when earned. That ratio came to 67.8% for the quarter and 65.6% for the nine-month period. On the same basis, our non-compensation ratios were 28.9% and 21.2% respectively.
Our adjusted operating margin, pretax operating earnings over adjusted net revenues, was 3.1% for the quarter compared to 14% for the third quarter of last year. The nine months ended in September, our margin was 12.9%, versus 14.3% a year earlier.
From a balance sheet perspective, our recourse debt-to-total capital ratio was 42% at quarter end. Shareholders' equity, all of which was tangible, was $131.2 million with book value per share declining during the quarter from $6.41 to $6.19, reflecting our GAAP net loss of $0.14 per share which was driven by soft investment banking revenues and net unrealized losses on principal investments.
During the third quarter, JMP Group made a regular cash distribution to shareholders of $0.12 per share as well as special distribution of $0.03 per share that was based on the companyâs first half investment results. For the first nine months of the year, we have distributed $0.37 per share in total, compared to $0.35 per share earned at the non-taxable PTP side of our company and $0.15 per share earned at the taxable C-corporation. All $0.15 per share C-corporation has been retained rather than distributed thus far in 2015.
Back to you, Joe.
Joe Jolson
Thanks Ray. After a productive first half of the year, JMP Securities was challenged by market volatility that led to a sequential decline of 56% in equity capital markets activities across Wall Street during the third quarter. As a result, JMP Securitiesâ adjusted net revenues were $18 million for the quarter. For the nine months ended in September, adjusted net revenues fell 13% to $73.6 million from a record level of $84.9 million a year earlier. Itâs important to note that $73.6 million would be the second highest total in our firmâs history.
For the first nine months of this year, JMP Securities contributed $0.28 to operating earnings with an operating margin of 13.8% versus $0.40 in the same period last year with an operating margin of 17.6%. For trailing 12-month period, JMP Securities produced a taxable return on equity of 35.4% with minimal financial leverage.
Going into September, we seem reasonably well positioned to deliver on a good quarter, but the third quarter nearly always depends on post Labor Day business conditions. In this regard, we were negatively impacted by the sharp selloff in smaller-cap equities and in particular even sharper selloff in life sciences and other momentum stocks. September was very tough month across Well Street, impacting us primarily through lower investment banking revenues, which also led to negative operating margin leverage and a small unrealized loss on our invested capital in our hedge funds versus our normal expectation of profits of $0.05 to $0.10 a share per quarter.
We were also hurt during the quarter by the postponed IPO of RiverBanc Multifamily Investors, a sponsored fund in which we have an economic interest. Our portion of that deal cost was roughly a penny per share.
During the recent draw decline in ECM activity, JMP Securities held its own in terms of its position among equity underwriters. Over the last 12 months, the firm has captured 106 basis points of U.S. equity underwriting fees paid in our four targeted sectors and has served as an underwriter of approximately one in every eight initial public offerings across all sectors.
This is important to note that the number of IPOs in the last 12 months was 144 compared to 293 in the same period in 2014, substantial decline. Weâre acutely focused on winning more high margin IPO mandates, book running more transactions whether IPOs or follow-ons and increasing our economics when we act as a co-manager. Additionally, we continue to focus on winning and closing more higher margin M&A and debt transactions.
Shifting to asset management: Our three operating platforms Harvest Capital Strategies, HCAP Advisors and JMP Credit Advisors earned a fully tax $0.04 a share in the quarter and the best quarter in a long time excluding net investment income. On a trailing four-quarter basis that was a return on equity of 31.9%. Asset management related fee revenues were $6.1 million in the quarter and $15.2 million for the nine months, both down sharply a year ago, primarily due to a decline in incentive fees which totaled just 20 million a year ago, but just 4.4 million so far in 2015.
As we mentioned in previous calls, the majority of our hedge fund incentive fee opportunity resides with Harvest Small Cap Partners, which had an outstanding year in 2014, producing a net return to investors of 31%. The fund had a tough first quarter of 2015, but as of the end of September had clawed its way back and was up 2.8% year-to-date. So, there were some incentive fees this quarter from Harvest Small Cap the first time in this year.
Total client assets under management including sponsored funds from which we earned fees equaled 2.8 billion at September 30th, up more than 260 million or 11% from a year earlier. Hedge fund assets under management including sponsored funds so decreased more than 4% during the quarter as roughly flat year-over-year at $907 million. Itâs important to point out though that roughly $55 million of the sequential decline in hedge fund AUM was due to the closure of Harvest Opportunity Partners due in July. That accounted for roughly 6 percentage points of the decline. So, excluding that, hedge fund assets under management would have actually grown 2% in one of the most difficult quarters, certainly the most difficult quarter since the financial meltdown.
At quarter-end, 33% of our sponsored AUM was in hedge funds and 67% was in private capital strategies. JMP Credit Advisors currently manages three CLOs and one total return swap totaling 1.2 billion in assets.
For the third quarter, we generated a slight loss of just 68 basis points on the capital invested alongside our LPs or hedge funds, which was disappointing from what we normally would expect, as I mentioned earlier. However, it compares very favorably with losses of almost 6% for the HFR Equity Hedge Fund index and almost 12% in the quarter for the Russell 2000. Including our hedge fund investments, CLO securities and principal another investments, our total return on invested capital in the quarter was 1.8%, a positive 1.8%; and annualized that would be 7.1%.
As I mentioned previously, net corporate income which is net investment income less all corporate expenses was essentially breakeven for the quarter. Year-to-date, itâs contributed $0.15 to total operating EPS of $0.50. And that generated on the invested capital, net positive ROE of roughly 5.3% for the first nine months.
In closing, I want to thank all the JMP employees as well as our independent directors for their continuing hard work and focus. And despite the industry headwinds, we did produce a profitable third quarter after a very strong first half. I look forward to sharing our full year results with everyone sometime in early 2016.
Now operator, if you could open up the line for any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research.
Alex Paris
Tough third quarter but as you said, not to a surprise given the equity markets and the reports of some of the other investment banks out there. My question is first and foremost aimed at investment banking. So, I'm assuming you did 11 deals in the quarter versus 27 in the quarter preceding and 26 deals a year ago. Can you quantify to some extent or in some way what got postponed or withdrawn? And then related, what's your outlook in that arena for the fourth quarter or the month of October?
Joe Jolson
Yes, I think that I can give you some rough numbers but I think I pointed out many times that pipeline is something we obviously track but closings are obviously what's important and what shows up in revenue. So, going into Labor Day, we had roughly another -- I'd say 5 million to 8 million maybe at the high end of that range of a public company financings that we thought would happen by the end of September that didnât. And it's unclear -- none of them were canceled. So, it's unclear whether those go forward or not this quarter. We have all witnessed the firming up in the last four weeks of the equity markets which is a good sign, although the life sciences space has continued to sell off which as you guys know is a larger part of our business than the overall market, so time will tell. It's literally few weeks into the quarter, so we will see what happens, Alex. We also have been saying every quarter that we have a pretty good pipeline on the M&A side and each quarter we donât show it in the revenue side. And that's continuing and we are hoping to close some of that by year-end as well.
Alex Paris
And then so I hear you on the life sciences side, what does the -- of the $5 million to $8 million in fees that were delayed or pushed out, what were life sciences; were there any other sectors represented in that postponement.
Joe Jolson
I donât have a breakout of that on the call here; we can get back to you on that. But just if you just kind of look at the mix typically of our ECM business, roughly, I'd say half of it plus is life sciences. So, I would assume that it's similar to what got pushed out.
Alex Paris
And then on the brokerage side, you had a slight decline in brokerage revenues, mid-single-digit sort of decline, $6 million, in line with our expectation, in line with the others. It seems the increased volatility didnât result in increased volume at least for institutional equity brokers. How do you measure your market share; do you think you maintained market share, took market share; and has that improved in October?
Joe Jolson
The numbers that we get on the brokerage side for market share are lagged by 3 months from the bottom. [Ph] So we won't actually know those numbers probably until January or something. The numbers I saw for the second quarter showed us flat to slightly higher market share year-over-year, if that helps, as you know in that regard. I should point out that like most firms, we report the net brokerage revenues and donât really break out the components. And one thing that's happening year-over-year in that line thatâs causing down draft a little bit is the comparison in our sales and our net commissions on the convert side. We had a pretty active 2014 on the convert side with a couple of situations that havenât -- hasn't so far recurred this year. And so part of that decline that you see which is as you point out is in a big decline is related to the tougher comp on the convert side. I think on the equity side of the business, weâre kind of flattish, maybe slight down by a couple of percentage points, so just to point that out. And I think that obviously itâll make easier comps in 2016 on the convert side, if activity picks up there.
Hopefully that's helpful. We are still hoping by the fourth quarter year-over-year that weâre flat to up in what we report in the brokerage side. But I've been saying that as the year has gone along and hasnât happened but weâre still expecting that to happen.
Alex Paris
And then just bookkeeping sort of question, the tax rate is influenced by non-taxable income as well as the taxable side. The tax rate was -- obviously is a credit because of the GAAP loss, but it was -- I still expected an expense given that the corporate side was -- I guess I didnât; it was a loss actually. I take that back. How should I think about taxes for the full year?
Joe Jolson
I think that taxes are really difficult thing for us to predict too. But I think that the -- weâre assuming in our operating earnings that our tax rate is 38% and historically itâs run less than that. So, we think that's a pretty conservative assumption that we use for our operating earnings. Obviously the PTP earnings have some expense in there of a public company, but anything above what you need for a public company, we push through the old JMP Inc. And that might be the difference that you are having a problem in predicting taxes because that reduces the tax rate in the Inc. right, versus what we show as -- three businesses after tax earnings. So that's probably the delta but that's a consistent delta; each quarter itâs probably $0.06 or $0.07 a share each quarter of after expenses in the Inc. if that helps you in terms of modeling that.
Alex Paris
Yes, that's helpful.
Joe Jolson
Up or down a lot, but itâs consistent, but thatâs why that tax -- I had the same question when I saw the numbers, why we didnât get a bigger tax recovery than what we did because -- and that's why.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Doug Doucette with KBW.
Doug Doucette
Just a couple of questions, first on the expense side, I was wondering if you could just provide the driver to the growth on the non-comp expenses. Is that just largely like a growth initiative business type expense or any color you could provide, would be appreciated.
Joe Jolson
Iâm not sure what -- non-comp expenses in dollarsâ¦
Ray Jackson
670,000 quarter-on-quarter from â15, thatâs going. [Ph] And of that Doug, a chunk of it was in the others line which is CLO -- primarily CLO admin, so we had a new CLO in the fourth quarter of â14 almost, so it wouldnât have been present in Q3 â14. And then the other part of it is I think primarily our life sciences conference; [ph] we had a higher headcount this year versus last year that increased the cost of that conference but otherwise itâs only 671,000 higher year-on-year.
Doug Doucette
And then on the 2Q call, I think you guys mentioned youâre keeping capital at the subs for growth purposes and acquisitions; is there any update you could provide on any of those initiatives?
Joe Jolson
Well, we have, as Ray mentioned, I think $0.15 of retained earnings year-to-date and our intention is to retain that. I mean we may distribute a couple of pennies with that because we don't want to necessarily return capital if the -- depending on the fourth quarter PTP earnings. But longer term, our intention is to retain the bulk of that if not all of those earnings for growth, just to be clear now. Obviously there were acquisitions that we couldnât be talking about it. So Iâm not sure exactly what you want me to comment on that part. But we look at stuff all the time. And I think we are hopeful at sometime in the next 12 months that there is something interesting to talk about, but thus far there isnât.
Doug Doucette
And then I guess just staying in that vein, is there any specific capabilities that you are targeting to add to the platform or is the acquisition -- potential acquisition rather going to be more optimistic --- sorry, opportunistic?
Joe Jolson
No, I think that we would look at related businesses, but typically the kind of stuff that we look at is in the businesses that weâre already in. And we compare it to where our stock is selling in terms of buying back stock. And itâs a tougher comparison bar to jump over today unfortunately with the selloff in our stock not that it was an easy comparison before that, because we thought our was undervalued, but this makes that a little bit tougher. And we compare it to building it organically over a three-year period in terms of evaluating it, kind of things that we typically look at or expanding our merger and acquisition business, M&A boutiques, potentially another research boutique in an area that we are not currently in, but we think is attractive longer term in terms of the areas that we would like to be in and in asset management in typically other kind of related strategies in the alternative asset world to what weâre already doing in terms of building out that business.
And we see a lot of things. We usually donât pursue many after seeing them. But I think that downturns and I donât know for in one yet other than it was a one quarter downturn for the markets. But if weâre in a little bit longer period of this or usually these are the periods where you get the best opportunities. So, I think now that my fund was closed in July, one of the reasons to do that was to focus some more on some of these strategic growth initiatives. And Carter Mack, our President spends a decent chunk of his time evaluating these things as well. So, we have couple of senior guys and a few other senior people focused on these efforts, JMP Securities as well as in asset management.
Operator
And at this time, there are no further questions. Iâll turn the conference call back over to management for closing remarks.
Joe Jolson
Yes. Thank you guys for continuing to -- you have an interest in our company. And while we werenât very happy with this quarterâs results, we were pleased that we were able to have another quarter of profitability. And weâre looking forward to hopefully a bounce back in the fourth quarter here. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you for participating on todayâs conference call. You may now disconnect.
