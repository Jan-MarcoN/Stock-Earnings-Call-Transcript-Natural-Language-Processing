James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Toni. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. Much has changed in our industry since we last spoke to you on our earnings call in early November. Back then, the price of oil had just dipped below $80 per barrel for the first time since briefly falling to that level in mid-2012. The declining oil price trend continued into 2015, and today, we're operating in a $50-per-barrel world.
Despite 2014 closing out in a declining commodity price environment, Rosetta successfully executed our 2014 operating plan and made significant progress in the development and delineation of our asset base. I'll review our key highlights for the year we just completed but I want to start with comments on how Rosetta is approaching the industry operating environment that we are now facing.
We first gave you a preview of our 2015 capital plans in early November. We have been consistent in our message on our commitment to protect our balance sheet. And I told you back then of our plans to reduce capital spending from 2014 levels to minimize or eliminate our spending cash flow even in a sub-$80-per-barrel world. In mid-December, we were in the $70-per-barrel-price environment, and we announced plans to spend $700 million to $800 million with year-over-year production growth of 20%. Of course, commodity prices have retreated further and, as promised, we are adjusting our plans to reflect current conditions.
We are already two months into 2015 and our two-year strategic plan is to hold our core acreage positions and prudently develop our portfolio of capital projects to preserve our inventory for a commodity-price recovery. We think this approach delivers the best shareholder value in a low-commodity price environment.
As shown on slide 3. Based on the current strip on our proposed 2015-2016 strategic outlook, we plan to spend up to $350 million in capital per year. We expect to defend annual production at roughly the 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day level for both 2015 and 2016, but with 70% less total capital per year than in 2014.
While we could spend more capital without stressing our balance sheet in this price environment, we do plan to execute a program that does not outspend the cash flow we expect to generate or require us to take on additional debt.
Beyond living within cash flow, there's another key rationale driving our decision to restrict capital spending to this level. We simply do not believe that this is an opportune time to bring online the best wells in our portfolio, especially when those wells recover almost half of their present value in the first two years. This is shown on slide 4.
In our Gates Ranch Far South area in the first two years of production, 30% of the reserves are recovered and nearly 50% of the present value is generated. Beyond our need to meet our lease commitments and hold our core acreage positions, we believe our inventory of drilling projects are more valuable in the ground at these commodity prices.
John Clayton will provide details on our 2015 planned activity in his remarks.
Rosetta is well positioned to deal with the current commodity price environment. We have great assets located in the two top basins. Let me remind you that most of our Eagle Ford portfolio is economic to a breakeven price of $30 per barrel and our Wolfcamp 'A' horizontal wells are also competitive with breakeven prices of about $45 per barrel.
We expect further improvements in project economics as service cost reductions are fully realized during the year. In addition, our senior revolving credit facility was recently amended to provide more favorable debt covenants leaving us with the financial year headroom to carry out our plans over the next several years. John Hagale will provide some additional information on our new covenants later.
Now, let's recap our key accomplishments in 2014, a year of successful execution across our operations. First, we delivered the highest production levels in company history for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Production for the year averaged 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Compared to 2013, we increased total daily equivalent production by more than 32%; oil production increased by 39%; natural gas production increased by 28%; and NGL production increased by 31%. We increased our total risk project inventory by 15% to 908 million barrels of oil equivalent.
Slide 5, we show our five-year total risked resource and production growth trends highlighting the strong growth profile delivered by our Eagle Ford and Permian activities. We drilled a record number of wells spending $1.2 billion in capital excluding acquisitions.
Early in the year, we completed a Delaware Basin bolt-on acquisition adding approximately 5,000 net acres in our Reeves County core area. Another key accomplishment last year was the solid progress we made in our Delaware Basin delineation program. We completed 17 operated horizontal wells in Reeves County, 15 of which were Wolfcamp 'A' wells. We also significantly improved the well completion design during the course of the year.
The 30-day average IP per 1,000 foot of lateral for the 12 Wolfcamp 'A' wells completed utilizing the improved design was about 290 Boes per day, compared to less than 130 Boes per day from the old design. In addition, we also successfully completed tests of the 3rd Bone Spring and Wolfcamp 'C' benches.
We reduced Eagle Ford total well cost nearly 10% with a new stimulation design based on shifting the proppant type from ceramic to sand and testing higher proppant loadings. And we initiated staggered pilot programs in the Upper and Lower Eagle Ford at Gates Ranch and the L&E leases.
Finally, we layered on additional 2015 oil hedges in the fourth quarter that are now providing additional protection for our revenue stream. In short, we made great progress in our Eagle Ford development and Delaware Basin delineation activities.
For 2015, we are prepared for a potentially challenging year for our industry. We have consistently stated we are a fiscally conservative company built to operate through the inevitable industry cycles and led by a management team familiar with navigating those cycles.
Despite the challenges, we think Rosetta is well prepared to defend a reasonable level of production, preserve our core acreage and live within our means, thereby positioning the company for the time when commodity prices recover.
In summary, we expect to focus on the disciplined execution of our two-year strategic plan and further improve our performance as a company. We are watching the industry environment very closely and feel that we have taken the right steps for Rosetta to continue to thrive in 2015 and 2016 and the years to come.
Now, let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide a summary of our financial results and comments on our credit facility and hedge position.
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, all of the information I'm reviewing today is contained in our 10-K as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC and are available on our website.
Let's start with financing and liquidity, that's a pretty important topic in today's environment. As we announced yesterday in our earnings release, we recently amended our credit facility to remove the total debt-to-EBITDA ratio. That's been replaced with a couple of new covenants.
The new covenants include a secured debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times and an interest coverage ratio of 2.5 times. These changes are important in our current commodity price environment, eliminating covenant concerns.
Our credit facility has a borrowing base of $950 million with a committed amount of $800 million. At year-end, we had drawn $200 million and had $600 million available capacity with another $35 million of cash on hand, a good liquidity position as we enter 2015 in the current price environment. In addition, our senior note maturities range from 2021 to 2024 and have an average interest rate of around 5.75%, so no near-term maturities.
Turning to our financial results, adjusted net income for the quarter â that's non-GAAP â was $15 million or $0.25 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $51 million or $0.83 a year ago. Fourth quarter 2014 adjusted net income excludes an unrealized derivative gain of $265 million. For the full year, we reported adjusted net income of $145 million or $2.35 per diluted share. That's versus $228 million or $3.87 a year ago.
The decrease in adjusted net income versus the prior year was mainly due to lower realized oil prices, increased DD&A expense, interest expense and LOE, partially offset by our higher volumes.
On realized prices, our fourth quarter realized oil price when you exclude derivatives was $62 a barrel. That's down $27 from the prior year and $24 from the third quarter. For full year 2014, our average realized oil price when you exclude derivatives was $83 a barrel. That's down $12 from the 2013 annual amount.
Our realized oil price for the fourth quarter was lower relative to the LLS index, primarily due to continued weakness in the Permian differentials and issues with our third-party oil gatherer in the Eagle Ford that required us to truck from the lease our oil product.
The Cushing to Midland differential was around $6 for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind that our realized oil price reflects the impact of quality, gravity and basis differentials. For modeling purposes for 2015 realized oil prices, I'll take you to the same metrics we've shown you in the past, which is we expect oil realized to be about LLS minus $12 to $14. That reflects some improvement in the Permian differential and our oil gatherer being back to full service. And I'll remind you those are before derivatives.
For 2015, we expect our NGL prices to be in the same range we've given you in the past, that's Mont Belvieu minus $4 to $5 for fractionation. That adjustment will move around depending on which plants end up processing our product. And for natural gas, we expect our gas prices to hover around Houston Ship Channel pricing.
In yesterday's release, we updated our production and expense guidance for the full year of 2015. For the first time, we also provided guidance for the upcoming quarter. Slide 6 outlines our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2015. If you look at production guidance for the first quarter, it's 64,000 to 67,000 barrel equivalent per day. It's roughly 10% lower than what we showed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Full year production guidance is 58,000 to 62,000 barrels a day and it's approximately 9% to 10% below â if you use the midpoint, below the full year last year. That's reflective of our proactive deferral of projects until commodity prices improve.
With respect to hedging, another important topic in today's environment, our notional volume hedged, if you look at all products, equates to almost three-quarters of our total 2015 projected equivalent production and about a third of our 2016 projected equivalents.
If you look just at swaps on oil, the notional volumes hedged equate to about 75% of projected oil for 2015 and about 40% of our projected 2016 oil. And both of those are swapped at around $90 a barrel. You might remember, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we also added some collars. These are 2015 collars, it's about 7,000 barrels a day and it's LLS-priced between $55 and $85 a barrel.
For 2015, the notional volume hedged, we've got more than all of our oil production hedged if you include the collars. Three-quarters of our natural gas production, again this is for 2015, and about a third of our NGL, and that's if you take the midpoint of the guidance we've given you.
In fact, in 2015, you may see us unwind some of our excess oil hedges, that's for the 2015 year. The notional volumes hedged in 2016 equates to about 40% of projected oil, is what I said earlier, about half of our natural gas. And if you look at all products, we're about a third hedged â again, if you're in the middle of the guidance range. A detailed summary of our derivative position as of February 23 is attached to the earnings release. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities to add derivatives as prices permit.
Now, let me turn the call over to John Clayton.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Despite the ups and downs in commodity prices, we had another year of solid progress in our operational activities. During this call, I will hit the high points of our operational results as well as share with you some updates on the status of various initiatives that we have under way. I'll also give you a brief summary of where we stand on proven reserves and inventory.
But let's begin with the topic I think you most want to hear about, and that is our plans for 2015 and directionally where we are headed into 2016. As Jim mentioned, we plan to spend up to $350 million in capital each year over the next two years. At that capital level, we will hold our core acreage positions together in both the liquids rich areas of the Eagle Ford and also in Reeves County over in the Delaware Basin.
Slide 7 outlines our current acreage position at the end of 2014 and the estimated position two years from now at the end of 2016. As you can see, this reflects our previously announced decision to forego capital spending on our dry gas Eagle Ford assets and also on our Gaines County exploration acreage over in the Midland Basin. We are also making the conscious decision to spend at a level that delivers stable production, remains cash flow neutral and preserves our project inventory for a commodity price recovery.
Slide 8 shows a simple comparison of the economics of our portfolio between the current price environment and commodity prices just five months ago. Across the portfolio, before tax rate of returns have been slashed by 50% or more.
More importantly, the impact of BFIT 10 values go from a 50% drop in our best Eagle Ford Gates Ranch area to a 100% drop on our newer 3rd Bone Spring projects in the Delaware Basin. And as Jim discussed, our Gates Ranch Far South area, nearly 50% of the present value is recovered in the first two years.
So, in a low-commodity-price environment, we think the most prudent course of action is to preserve the value of our portfolio by keeping as many of those projects in inventory as possible while still accomplishing our strategic objectives.
In 2015, drilling and completion costs should account for approximately 80% of the total capital spending with the remaining 20% allocated to central facilities, leasehold, and other corporate costs. We plan to complete roughly 20 gross operated wells in the Eagle Ford and eight gross operated wells in the Permian for a total of 28 completions in 2015.
This well count does not include any non-operated activity in the Permian Basin, which we do anticipate to have. Company-wide, we plan to drill a total of 18 wells, which means we plan to reduce our backlog of drilled wells awaiting completion by 10 this year.
We will primarily focus on the high rate of return areas in southern Gates Ranch, as well as the Wolfcamp 'A' bench in the Delaware Basin. In doing so, we plan to operate up to two rigs in both the South Texas and Delaware Basin.
At a level of capital spend and activity, we expect to defend an annual production averaging roughly 60,000 Boes per day. We are therefore guiding 58,000 to 62,000 Boes per day for 2015. We are also guiding 2016 to be within the same range. So, you can see that by living within cash flows and keeping our core acreage intact, we will produce roughly 60,000 Boes per day over the next two years.
Now let's turn to our outlook on service cost. With the dramatic drop in oil price, industry rig counts have also sharply declined and service costs are adjusting downward at a fast pace. We are actively engaged in productive discussions and negotiations with our Eagle Ford and Permian service providers.
Roughly 600 rigs were laid down over the last four months and 700 more are projected to go within the next six months. Day rates are down more than 10%. Pricing on tubular goods is down roughly 20% if you use 5.5 casing as an indicator.
Over the next six to eight months, we expect additional pricing pressures on tubulars to continue to fall as the rig counts fall further.
The largest cost reductions have been on the stimulation side. We have seen roughly 200 of the 470 frac spreads taken off the market in the past four months. And as a result, the pricing for stimulation services is down 20% to 30%.
If you look at an all-inclusive total well cost, the decreases are currently running about 20%. Looking forward, we are anticipating cost reductions across our operations to range from 20% to 30% by the end of 2015.
However, these cost reductions still do not offset the per well present value that was lost from the recent fall in commodity prices. Therefore, for this reason, we have intentionally decided to not burn through our inventory during this low commodity price environment. We believe that preserving the option to realize these incremental present values are in the best interest of our shareholders.
Now, let's touch on some of our operational accomplishments from 2014. On the production front, our fourth quarter production totaled 73,000 Boes per day, an increase of 41% from the same period in 2013 and essentially flat to our third quarter production.
This production result was at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, which was 72,000 Boes per day to 74,000 Boes per day. Productions for the full year 2014 averaged 66,000 Boes per day, up 32% from 2013. This result was at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result was due to our ongoing development of our Eagle Ford assets and higher production from an increased activity and strong well results in the Delaware Basin.
Oil production in 2014 averaged 19,000 barrels per day, an increase of 39% from 2013 and daily NGL production increased by 31% compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter Eagle Ford production was 65,000 Boes per day, up 36% from the prior year and flat to the third quarter. For the year, Eagle Ford production averaged 59,000 Boes per day, up 25% compared to 2013.
Our Permian assets added 8,000 Boes per day to our fourth quarter production and 6,000 Boes per day to our full-year production level. In 2014, we spent $1.2 billion of cash, excluding acquisitions. We drilled a total of 140 gross operated wells and completed 131 gross operated wells during the year. Capital spending included $666 million to drill 94 wells and complete 95 wells in the Eagle Ford shale.
In the Permian Basin, we spent $362 million where 46 wells were drilled and 36 wells were completed. As a side note, we exited 2014 with a backlog of 60 Eagle Ford wells and 20 Permian wells that have been drilled but are awaiting completion. The Permian backlog includes 15 horizontal and five vertical wells.
Now let's review our recent Permian well results. So, please turn to slide 9. We continue to make progress with our Delaware Basin delineation activity. This is our familiar map of our Reeves County position. In yellow are the operated leases and the areas in ash gray are the non-operated. Our total Reeves County acreage is roughly 47,000 net acres. The wells in solid blue are the horizontal wells that Rosetta has completed or we have participated in through the end of the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we added three Wolfcamp 'A' horizontal completions. These three recent completions utilize a slickwater initiated completion design. The Intrepid 27-38 number 2H well is our longest lateral well drilled to date and is located in the south central portion of our acreage position. This well was completed with a 7,000-foot lateral and had 26 frac stages. It had a seven-day initial stabilized production rate of a little over 1,900 Boes per day while the 30-day stabilized rate was slightly over 1,700 Boes per day. The 30-day rate calculates to a very competitive 246 Boes per day per 1,000-foot lateral.
Our other two completions, the Blue Duck well and the Rodeo State well are both delineation wells located on the edge of our acreage position. The Blue Duck is on the western side and the Rodeo State is located on the north northwestern edge. They both had production rates of approximately 224 Boes per day for per 1,000-foot of lateral, which is very good. These two tests further expanded the boundaries of what we considered quality Wolfcamp 'A' reservoir. All in all, the three fourth quarter tests were very encouraging. Overall, our completed operated horizontal well count now stands at 19.
Also shown on this map in green are the 15 horizontal well locations that have been drilled and are awaiting completion. This backlog spans our acreage position and is a good indicator of our delineation focus today.
I shared slide 10 with you last quarter. It has now been updated to add our fourth quarter completions. The chart plots the average 30-day rate per 1,000-foot of lateral completed in chronological order.
In the second quarter of last year, we changed our completion fluid design from a gel initial fluid to a slickwater initial fluid. As you can see, we experienced immediate improvement. The average 30-day rate per 1,000 foot for wells prior to the change was 129 Boes per day.
After the design change, the average has been 290 Boes per day or roughly 125% improvement. Keep in mind this includes some wells like the Blue Duck and Rodeo State wells that are continuing to delineate the boundaries of the Wolfcamp 'A' reservoir.
If you will now please turn to slide 11, you will see our recent fourth quarter wells and their production through the first 100 days. This production is normalized to 5,000-foot lateral and is plotted against our initial type curve for the Upper Wolfcamp, which is 550,000 Boes.
Slide 12 adds the updated production in light gray for our Wolfcamp 'A' wells that were completed in the third quarter. Overall, the wells are holding up quite nicely and outperforming the type curve. As we compile more well performance data, look for us to possibly make changes to the type curve later this year.
Now, let's talk about our year-end proved reserve results and our capital inventory. At year-end, proved reserves totaled 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. That includes a 61% liquids mix and 49% are now classified as proved developed reserves.
While we were successful in expanding our unproved inventory in 2014 by 120 million Boes, the recent and dramatic drop in the forward commodity curve resulted in us making the decision to not book any additional undrilled PUD locations.
This decision was not based on well economics but rather the SEC guideline ensuring that all PUDs must be believed to be developed within a five-year period. Since we deliberately chose to reduce our capital spending and not aggressively develop our portfolio at these reduced prices, we decided to place these additional locations into our inventory rather than book them as PUD.
Therefore, as future commodity prices recover, our capital levels are methodically ramped up, we will be able to book those locations as PUD as long as we believe they will be developed within a five-year period. Despite this decision, Rosetta still replaced 113% of production from all sources, including net reserve additions from drilling activity, price revisions, proved acquisitions and performance revisions.
Organically, we replaced 106% of production. Proved developed reserves also increased by 53% to 138 million Boes at approved, developed F&D cost of roughly $16 per Boe. The changes to our proved reserved base in 2014 included 24 million Boes of reserve additions, primarily from the development success in the Eagle Ford and Permian areas. We added 19.5 million Boes in the Eagle Ford and 4.8 million Boes in the Permian.
We also added 2 million Boes of proven reserves acquired during the year and another 1 million Boes of additions through net positive revisions. In total, our year-end 2014 proved undeveloped reserves included 229 booked locations, which is down from 306 locations last year. A total of 93 PUD locations are located in Gates Ranch. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves as of December 31, 2014 was $2.6 billion, an increase of 14% from the prior year.
Now some comments on our inventory. At year-end 2014, our net risked project inventory totaled 908 million Boes, including proven undeveloped reserves. This amount reflects a 15% increase to the inventory portfolio as compared to 788 million Boes at the end of 2013. If you include total proven reserves and unproved resource, our total net risked resource potential increased by 19% from 879 million Boes to more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
I'll close with a look at slide 13. This slide clearly shows the tremendous historical results we have had growing our resource and production base to where it sits today. The production graph also shows that going forward in a challenging price environment, we expect to deliver consistent performance over the next two years.
That concludes my operational remarks. And as always, I thank you for your interest in our operations. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John. I hope our remarks this morning have provided insight on our outlook for 2015 and 2016. In closing, I want to reiterate our key messages on how we will behave in this commodity price environment.
Rosetta operates in two of the most economically attractive basins in North America with some of the lowest breakeven costs. Our portfolio of capital projects generates competitive returns at today's commodity pricing and at even lower prices. Our Eagle Ford projects recover almost 50% of their present value in the first two years of production. As a result, we think it's prudent to restrict spending in this environment and defer the majority of our high-value inventory until prices rebound.
So, we will invest in a minimum capital program to hold our acres together by drilling obligation wells or extending leases, keep production at roughly the 60,000 Boe-per-day level and live within cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to have a bias for living within our means to fund our capital spending.
Rosetta is focused on financial discipline to maintain flexibility throughout the commodity price cycles. We have successfully amended our credit agreement with new covenants. We have an active hedging program and strong hedge positions in 2015 and 2016. We remain committed to protecting our balance sheet integrity and ensuring adequate liquidity.
Our technical teams continue to work on improving the efficiency of operations by decreasing costs, proving completion designs and increasing recoveries. We are actively engaged with our service providers and are realizing service cost reductions across our operations. Rosetta has an experienced senior leadership team that has managed through many industry cycles and understand what it takes to position the company to thrive in the longer term. We also retain a lot of flexibility to increase activity when commodity prices signal a better economic environment.
In summary, 2015 will be a year in which Rosetta is focused on disciplined execution. We made great progress during 2014, and we are well positioned to competently execute our long-term strategies in South Texas and the Permian Basin.
Before we open the call for Q&A, I want to thank Rosetta's technical and business support teams for their hard work and responsiveness throughout 2014. There's no group I'd rather work with in either good times or bad.
I'll now turn the call the back to the moderator so that we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Hey, guys. I was hoping you could put a little bit of color around your commentary in terms of when's the right time to ramp up? Can you talk in terms of what type of oil price you might need or service cost reductions you might need to see? And is it still possible that you could ramp up more later on in 2015?
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Leo, good question. I think it's going to take a combination of things. We're watching the service costs as they continue to come down. And obviously, well economics will be affected by that. So, wells that made a certain rate of return in the old pricing environment at, say, $85 or $90 oil can make those same returns at a lower price.
I'm not going to speculate on what that price is at this point, but clearly, we're not there today. And we think we've got a lot of flexibility. It won't take us very long to ramp back up once we see that price signal and see returns back in the level that makes sense to us and our investors. But we're certainly not there today.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. So when you say it won't take very long for you all to ramp up, is that basically just saying that when the signals are there, you guys can start to work through your backlog and start kind of completing some of these wells here? And I guess, just additionally, I was a little surprised that you guys kind of came out with sort of a loose guidance in 2016 as well. Can you just talk through the thought process there?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Leo, this is John. I think you hit the nail on the head with the backlog of wells. So we came into the year with 80 wells total, I think, that were drilled but not completed. 60 in the Eagle Ford and 20 in the Permian. We'll reduce that backlog by 10, so we're still going to be sitting at the end of 2015 with our current plans of 70 wells drilled but not completed. So ramping up on that is a lot quicker than going out and getting rigs and permitting and building locations and getting wells drilled and then on the frac schedule, so the ramp back up could be fairly effective or maybe more efficient. So I guess I would just answer the question with the way you addressed it, which is due to the backlog that we've had on wells that only need to be completed in order to go down the sales line, we can do that fairly quickly.
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And then, Leo, on the second part of your question, yeah, I mean, so we put out 2016 ranges there just to give folks an understanding. Again, you've heard us use the word defend a couple times. We feel like it is important while living within cash flow and exercising this discipline, we want to make sure that we maintain a production level from which we can then grow pretty well. And so, that's that 60,000-barrel-a-day range. And basically, what we're saying is we think we can keep it at that level through 2016.
We said $350 million or less. It may â what we're seeing is, these wells, as they age, obviously the decline goes down. And that kind of helps us out as we get into the out year. So, we feel very comfortable with the range that we've put out there for 2016.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Corales of Howard Weil. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian Corales - Howard Weil Inc.
I hate to keep harping on the same 2016 question, but keeping production I guess relatively flat versus 2015, you would basically just go through your uncompleted inventory? Is that kind of the way to think about it?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Brian. This is Clayton. We can't solely do that. We've got to drill a few wells here and there on some continuous drilling obligations. Let me make one comment on 2016, though, and I'm not trying to be cute on it, but I think the way we guided was up to $350 million per year for the next two years. As our hedges roll off, looking at 2016, we won't be spending all the $350 million for 2016 in order to hit that 60,000 barrel a day range. We'll be south of that number by a pretty good bit.
So, that would be my, I guess, commentary on 2016, which is we will have to drill some wells because some leases are on continuous drilling obligations, which means you just can't complete a well that's already been drilled. But it's not that many. And then the next is 2016, living within cash flow is quite a bit less capital than the $350 million. So, that's kind of why we phrased it above $200 million, $350 million for the next two years.
Brian Corales - Howard Weil Inc.
Okay. Now that's helpful. And then in the Permian, what is the obligation there? I mean, do you have to keep at least one rig running? How should we think about that as well?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
No. It's real tough to do all this on a real quick call. So, in my script, we talked about up to two rigs in both of the areas. There will be points in time in both South Texas and the Permian where we have no rigs running. So, we don't have to keep rigs drilling all the time. We have to drill some on some leases, and then 180 days later, we may have to drill another well.
So, the thing about our inventory and our portfolio, that I won't say is unique to Rosetta but it's something that stands out with Rosetta, is we don't have that much acreage that we're still trying to test on fringes that require us to go out and test it. A lot of our acreage can be held with minimal capital. I think a couple years ago, you guys would ask us, well, what's the maintenance capital levels? And if you look at what we've got for the next two years with two basins, we're quite a bit less than those numbers that we guided a couple years ago. So, I would categorize our portfolio as something that's very efficient in holding together. And I think you could see that on that two-year slide of what we're going to let go and then what's going to expire in two years.
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And I would just add. There's an element in these CapEx numbers for both years that are lease extensions. So, we have been successful. And I think we anticipate continuing to be successful with a fairly modest amount of spend, being able to get extensions on some of the leases that are important to us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Mike.
Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC
I was hoping to understand the dynamics around 2015's CapEx a little bit more. You said you could spend up to $350 million. But it seems like the CapEx associated with the 28 completions and some other money thrown in there, it could be about $100 million less than that. And we're just kind of adding up from what your individual well costs are. Just wanted to get your thoughts around that.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Mike. This is John. So let me try to at least explain how I would look at it if I was trying to model it. I'll start with the $350 million and I'll emphasize the up-to-part and I think that will be a theme you hear, but up to $350 million. But for the sake of this, I'll start with the $350 million.
20% of that is going to be non-drilling and completion dollars. So that's going to be lease acquisition, lease extension facilities and some of our corporate capital. I'll take off $70 million on that and that gets me to about $280 million for drilling and completion.
We're going to drill and complete about 18 wells. The majority of those are going to be over in the Eagle Ford. And if you look at the third row that we're drilling in the Eagle Ford, those are longer lateral wells. If you look at over in the Permian, one of those wells was 7,000 feet we just drilled. And then, we've drilled a 10,000-foot well in the Eagle Ford recently.
So, some of the wells are a little bit longer, but let's take about $50 million in round numbers for those 18 wells. And now, we're down to $230 million of after our drilling. So, we'll complete now 28 wells, and 20 of those are going to be in the Eagle Ford, and I'll draw your attention to row three again at Gates, those are longer lateral wells. We are spacing the clusters tighter. So although service costs are going down, we're pumping almost twice as much proppant now in the Eagle Ford that we were doing six months ago.
So I would back off about $150 million for completions of the 28 wells, and now I'm going to get real close to your $100 million number, but that now leaves us with about $80 million, doing my math. I would model that â or the way we'd modeled is about half of that is going to be Permian non-operated. And then, half of the $80 million is going to be discretionary dollars.
So, to get the max on the $350 million that would mean we would spend the entire $40 million on discretionary, whether that's extra lease extensions or drilling a few more wells is yet to be determined, or we may not spend it. So that's kind of how I would back into it. So I think your back-of-the-envelope number was pretty close with the way that we're looking at it.
Michael Dugan Kelly - Global Hunter Securities LLC
Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. And then, maybe I missed this, but just your thoughts on the timing of these completions and what are you thinking for Q1, Q2 specifically? Thanks.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm going to be general on that, but Q1 will be a little heavier. So, let's assume â let's just average everything to where it'd be 25% for each quarter. Q1's probably going to be a little on the high side of that. Q2 and Q3 will be on the low side of that and Q4 will be on the high side of that. So, that's â I wouldn't get too wild and crazy about ups and downs, but we'll do a little bit more, one in 4Q than we will in 2Q and 3Q. And it's really more from ramping down from 2014, and then the anticipated cost savings that we see trending towards the end of the year and ramping back up in the fourth quarter.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good morning, everyone. So, I appreciate the economic aspect of cutting back production but can you maybe give some color around your discussion with the banks in order to get the covenants renegotiated?
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
This is Hagale. Yeah. We went to the banks and ask them to take a look at our covenants. The debt-to-EBITDA covenant is one that I think most of you guys saw that most of the mid-and-small-cap group was going to have some issue depending on prices either late this year or early next year. And so, we went to them and ask them to take a look at those.
They didn't give us a waiver. We actually amended the agreement for the life of the agreement which ends in 2018 and they removed the debt-to-EBITDA because as prices drop, your EBITDA is going to drop pretty fast. They removed the debt-to-EBITDA and replaced it with a secured debt-to-EBITDA and remember our secured debt is really just a revolver. We don't have a lot drawn on there and it's pretty low interest rate. And then added an interest coverage ratio. So, I wouldn't call those difficult negotiations with the bank. Actually, I think the banks have been very supportive of us.
Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. So, that's not driving â that's not part of the drive to basically spend within cash flow?
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
No. The drive to spend within cash flow is our philosophy on where we want to be right now. I think we've got a good amount of room under those new covenants.
Jason Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thanks. And one quick one. Just in Permian, by drilling to the Wolfcamp 'A', are you giving up the deeper zones or because of continuous drilling you still hold them?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
For the most part, we still hold them as long as we're still meeting our continuous drilling obligation on the lease. That's not 100% accurate. There's a couple of leases where you lose it, But the vast majority, as long as we fulfill the continuous drilling, it doesn't matter what depth we drill to.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Good morning, guys. Say, probably for John â for Clayton, I would guess. Two questions just really mostly center on the Delaware Basin, John, around this. First, I guess, just looking at that â I think it's slide 8. I'm a little surprised just given how good your Intrepid results are or that well was.
And then, I know you mentioned about the Blue Duck and the Rodeo being delineation. So, I guess, when I look at there and just sort of see your early return estimates on there, to me that seems maybe a little bit low just given how good those wells have been returning so far.
So, I guess, one, first question, just wondering if you could maybe talk about â I know it says around, I think, January pricing, but if you could talk a little more about pricing costs, EUR, sort of estimates for that Wolfcamp 'A' return there?
And then really just my second part of the question, is it just simply because of this slide, the Gates Ranch, which you're showing the returns there versus the Delaware Basin kind of why to drill the 20 wells there this year versus the eight or so in the Permian.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Great questions. On slide 8, I'm glad you asked that. So, these are the economics of the type curves that we have. So, Neal, on the Wolfcamp 'A', for instance, the one that goes from 36% rate of return to 17% rate of return, that's our 550,000 Boe type curve for a typical 5,000-foot lateral well. So, the Intrepid well is obviously 40% longer than that and it's outperforming it. So, yeah, you'd probably expect that well to have quite a bit different economics on the good side to what the type curves are. But this represents the type curves that we have out in the public domain.
The other question to how we allocate, the wells that we have in the Permian were really allocated towards where can we get the best delineation to fulfill our continuous drilling obligations? So, kind of like the prior question. I don't know if Brian or Mike or Jason asked it. But to fulfill the drilling obligations, it's the eight wells that we have to drill and so we allocated them towards the better economics, which is Wolfcamp 'A' from a relative standpoint.
South Gates, those wells still pay out within the two-year window that we're talking about living within cash flow in. And any time you allocate capital and you can get that money back within the time period, you're trying to live within cash flow, you allocate more wells towards those higher rate of return projects. So, I hope I answered those questions.
Neal D. Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
No. You did. Thanks a lot, John.

Any update on those Upper Eagle Ford tests from North Gates or Briscoe? And if you have any color as to how Netherland [Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc] treated the Upper Eagle Ford at the year-end report, and maybe thoughts on where the Upper Eagle Ford program fits in now with the new reduced CapEx, I'd appreciate it.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Well, this is John. So, I think the last quarter call is how we're looking at it still going forward. The thicker parts of the Eagle Ford, which are our northern Gates, Briscoe and western side of Dimmit County, all are performing to where we think those will be commercial plays in those areas. So, we like what we're seeing.
I'll point out though in the southeastern part of Gates where we've got an 11-well Upper Eagle Ford pilot on the third row on the east side and then another 3-well pilot right above it, those are in the thinner parts of the Eagle Ford, lesser quality rock. It probably doesn't behoove having a lower take point and an upper take point. And I think those results are showing that. So, if you exclude the thin Eagle Ford from the discussion, we really like what we're seeing.
So, L&E is still performing where we think those upper wells will be economic. We did just kind of an update along those lines. I think I told you guys last quarter we would be drilling Upper Eagle Ford wells at Briscoe Ranch. We drilled but not completed those, but kind of the asterisk on that is one of the Upper Eagle Ford is a 5,000-foot lateral and one of them is a 10,000-foot lateral.
And although we'll be testing the Upper Eagle Ford from a 10,000-foot lateral, the real value driver of that is we've now been able to drill. We'll see if we can complete it, but we've been able to drill a 10,000-foot lateral across the Briscoe lease. And that could possibly, even from a lower Eagle Ford development standpoint, instead of two wells because that lease, if you remember, is about 10,000-feet wide. We'll be able to displace two wells and the capital spending with drilling one well. So we should get some efficiencies there. But anyway, it's a long-winded answer, but that's where we stand, Welles.
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And just a reminder to everyone that the Upper Eagle Ford is held by the lease terms of the Lower Eagle Ford. So that inventory is intact, and so we don't feel any need to go faster there, kind of much the opposite. So we're focused on Lower Eagle Ford development in this minimum capital program. And as John said earlier, we've got some discretionary capital that we're looking at later in the year, and so we'll kind of see how the market and oil prices do and that'll help drive what we decide to do there.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. Perfect. And â then one last one, is there any move to market Encinal and Gaines, or is the market for that just too soft to give up that optionality?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. We're not seeing much in the way of value in Gaines, but we are looking at the possibility of marketing Encinal. And don't have anything we can talk about there right now.

Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Thanks. Good morning.
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Morning, Mike.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
I guess, one question I had is just kind of thinking further out into a normalized type timeframe. You all had â to your point had a $700 million to $800 million-type capital budget at a, say, $70 level as recently as the fall. Is that still a fair way to think about long-term guidance both in terms of activity levels if I'm ramping models back up in the out years? Or is there more of a balance sheet and I guess, focus even beyond the 2016 period? Like has this changed your, I guess your long-lasting philosophy around the balance sheet or will you quickly ramp back up to those sorts of levels given the opportunity?
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Michael, that's a good question. No, I think we are thinking we want to live within cash flow in the long term. And so, yeah, now, again, a $70 price environment could look different to us from that perspective in terms of how many projects we can do if those projects cost less...
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Sure.
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
...if there's lower cost structure. So that may end up giving us the ability to deliver some of those results that we previously had in that $700 million to $800 million environment with less capital. And we could be able to do both, live within cash flow and do more projects. So ...
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And Michael, this is Hagale. What I'd say is, we'll see how this equates over time. But as an industry, we can't keep spending double our cash flow on CapEx. So it didn't seem to get us a lot in the markets over the last couple years, the fact that we grew at the rates we did. And so, I think you're going to see us closer to a cash flow number, occasionally supplementing it, maybe, with some debt. But on and on, I think you're probably looking at closer to cash flow.
Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors
Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks. Appreciate the candor. And then, on AFEs, could you all â maybe I missed it. What are current AFEs by area through the Permian and the Eagle Ford for a standard 5,000-foot lateral? And then what, if you had to take an estimate, would be the average lateral length targeted in the Permian and the Eagle Ford in 2015?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. Michael, this is John. We're modeling about 20% down and we'll update the investor deck. But it's about 20% down is what we're forecasting for the year. Towards the end of the year, it could be a little higher than that. I think maybe closer to 30%. But right now, it's about 20% down from probably our prior investor deck that's out there.
Average length for the Permian, I would still stick to that 5,000-foot range just because of some of the geometries of the leases that we have. We'll drill Intrepid wells, which are longer laterals when we have the opportunity, but just because of the lease geometry. That's different, though, in South Texas. I'm going to speculate and give you a round number, but the average length of probably the activity for the next couple of years in the Eagle Ford will be probably be about 7,000 feet. I said we've already got one well at Briscoe, that's 10,000 feet. We'll be drilling wells that are much longer than 7,000 feet, but then we'll also have some that live within the 5,000-foot range. But I'd say average of 7,000 feet in the Eagle Ford and 5,000 feet in the Permian.

Thank you. And our final questions come from the line of Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International
Good morning, guys.
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International
I wanted to touch base back on the upper results. I know that we're completing 10 Ducks during the year. Are some of those the uppers that we're sitting here at Briscoe, and could we potentially get results for those end of next quarter or maybe midyear?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
No. All the upper wells that we have producing are that 11-well pilot in Gates Southeast, a 3-well pilot in Gates kind of east, and then a 3-well pilot in Western Dimmit County. So, the Gates â or excuse me â the Briscoe wells have yet to be completed.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International
Yeah, but are those part of the Ducks that you're planning on completing this year?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
They could be. Jim had mentioned that discretionary capital at the end. So, they very well could be and we'd like to get some test data on it. But the Briscoe Ranch property, which offers this tremendous inventory, is held by production. So, unlike the other areas where you do have continuous drilling, we actually have that property that's already HBP. So, any dollars allocated towards that are truly discretionary, and they're not for filling and keeping the core position intact. But it is in a good area.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Co. International
Great. And then on the Permian drilling for the year, we've got eight wells being completed. I guess at the end of that list, how much of the go-forward acreage, I guess, your end of 2016 planned Reeves County acreage is actually delineated?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Which slide number is that? I would just kind of go to the slide â I'm going through them over here to see the exact number of the Permian map, Toni. I would just kind of look at that map there and you see in â if you take the Blue Duck well, which is our furthest test to the west so far, we're going to watch how that well plays out. The Rodeo State well, which is furthest to the north, is performing really well. So, if you kind of triangulate between not only what we have but some of the other operators have, you're starting to see the majority of that, at least the large yellow operated area, is starting to â what we would consider some of our higher tier Wolfcamp 'A' property stuff.
I would just keep your eye on this map right here. Most of the activity by everybody has been Wolfcamp 'A'. And originally, we started as an industry kind of towards the eastern part of this map and moved west. But you can see as we keep moving and changing the completion designs, we're delineating the majority of it.
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning...
James E. Craddock - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Morning, Mike.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
...and thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to get a sense again, just a little bit more on the production trajectory over the next two years implied in the guidance. So, I guess my first question would be do you have a feel for what the exit PDP decline rate would be from call it Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of 2015?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. I was thinking that you guys may ask that question based on some of the stuff I read this morning. So, I've got some numbers for the group. If you take a look at how we entered 2015, we had, as a company, about 500 wells coming into 2015 that I'll call the base production. About a third of those, I think it's about 30%, but about a third of those, we drilled as recently as 2014. So, that means, some of those wells were drilled 12 months ago, but some of them were just brought back online or brought online in November and December.
So, our base production from coming into 2015 to going in to 2016, declined at about 40%. And if you remember, we built this entire acreage position from scratch, so to speak, and we sold all of the long flat declining properties in our portfolio when we decided to go into the Eagle Ford.
If you push now the base out, you take those same 500 wells and you now move out two years. Those wells at the end of our period in 2016 go into 2017 are going to decline at about 19%. So, we're doing a couple of things here. One, we're preserving our portfolio that gives us the BFIT 10 values that we can drill at higher prices.
But another thing is we're building a base decline as a company that is not in the hyperbolic stages. It's moving more towards the exponential part of the decline curve and that's a lot easier to start planning business around than a company that's got a lot of hyperbolic wells being brought on at different times during the year.
So I hope that answers your question, Michael. That's something we've tried to articulate as we brought on all these high rate Eagle Ford wells over time is there's a base that falls away from you. But going forward, we're starting to build a base now that's a lot more stable and a lot more predictable and we've got a great appreciation for that as you add capital because it makes it a lot more capital efficient to grow volumes.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Great. Yeah. That's very helpful context. And I guess just my follow-up would be you kind of mentioned in 2016 at $350 million CapEx number, you wouldn't really have to spend all of that to actually hold production flat throughout that year. So I guess, is there any more context you can provide in terms of what you would actually have to spend just to keep at that base production flat? Because I think that'll have an important implications for...
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'm going to give you -
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
...your indiscernible (1:02:20) cash flows.
John E. Hagale - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
This is Hagale. I'll give you the first part and then I'll let Clayton talk about what you need. But what I'd say is when you run your models based on the prices that you use and see the hedges rolling off, you're going to get to a lower number. And we've told you we'd like to kind of live plus or minus a little bit within cash flow.
So 2016 cash flow's going to be less, and so we'd spend less than the $350 million that we roughly talked about this year. And Clayton, do you want to talk about it?
John D. Clayton - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. The only thing I would add to Hagale is when you're in these downturns and these down cycles and you guys and we've all seen all this stuff before, we try to allocate capital towards projects that have higher rates of returns. So, we don't have that capital outlay that's out there for many, many years before we get the investment back. Well, for our portfolio, that means allocating towards Gates Ranch to the south.
That also happens to give us the most efficient production uplift. So, it depends on where you allocate that capital towards how much capital is needed to keep production flat, if you're following me on the logic. So, by allocating it more towards southern Gates, we can keep production flat, at quite a bit less than $350 million.
Now, if we saw some price improvement and we decided to allocate production away from Gates South, it would be less production volume efficient, although it would be value â maybe efficient in the Permian and more delineation and so forth. So, I hope I explained that the way we're thinking about it, because it's a good question.
