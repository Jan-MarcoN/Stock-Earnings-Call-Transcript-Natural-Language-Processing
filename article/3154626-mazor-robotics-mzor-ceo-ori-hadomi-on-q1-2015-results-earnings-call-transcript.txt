Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael. And welcome to Mazorâs first quarter 2015 conference call to discuss our operating performance and financial results. I will begin by discussing the quarter results and then we will review the overall the market environment and our near and longer terms strategy as we stick to build on our leadership position in Robotics spine surgery market.
One month ago, we announced that we sold three Renaissance systems in the first quarter of 2015. Subsequently to the end of the quarter and through today, we sole an additional system in the U.S. market.
In the first quarter, one Renaissance was sold in the U.S., representing the 47 systems in U.S. market and two was sold internationally and installed at hospitals in Germany and Taiwan, representing the 12 and four system installed in those market, respectively.
While U.S. remains our primary growth market. We have made significant progress in generating awareness and establishing the presence in the Asia-Pacific market. On a global basis, as of the end of the first quarter of 2015, there were 86 systems installed compared to 68 systems at the end of the 2014 first quarter, an increase of 26%.
Our revenues which consist of systems sales, disposables and service was $4.5 million in the quarter, down slightly from a year ago first quarter level, record revenue continues to demonstrate strong growth in the quarter increasing 35% to $2.7 million.
While we are disappointed that the slow pace of growth in system sale, we are very encouraged by the high level of sales activity and the strong pipeline we are experiencing in the market. Our pipeline continue to grow and modification we have made in the sales team, as well as the sales forces begin to bear fruits.
Our engagement with hospital decision maker start earlier in the process and we feel, as well the sale cycle is still lengthy, we are beginning to see positive signs from the adjustment we made and discussed on previous calls.
In the first quarter, we experienced record procedure volume. We are proud to say we recently achieved the 10,000 procedure milestones, critical metric that demonstrates the high level usage, as well as the customer satisfaction with the systems currently in use.
In U.S., we sold the system to one of the nationâs largest investor-owned healthcare services company. This represents the six Renaissance systems installed into this hospital network. The second system was installed at St. John's Hospital, which is located in Kattappana, Germany demonstrating the first Renaissance system purchased by a private clinic in Germany.
The third system was installed in [Guanshan] [ph] General Hospital which is located Taichung City in Taiwan. Overall, it represent the fourth Renaissance system in Taiwan, which is becoming an increasingly permanent market in row both system sales, as well as in high utilization levels. As we move into the second quarter of 2015, we continue to pursue a number of patent opportunities that were at advanced level of discussions with hospital we speak.
We closed deal since the beginning of the quarter in Richmond, Virginia. This sales increase our U.S. systems to 48 overall as of to-date. Of these systems, which represent 45 active accounts, since three hospitals have two systems, 25 accounts have three or more Renaissance systems.
On average there are 2.9 U.S. account and this number has steadily increased over the past two year. We strongly encourage multiple users and our clinical team is focus on this aspect because it developed more surgeon advocate, build greater awareness within the hospital and indirectly support the opportunity to sale additional systems into that hospital.
Over the past two years, 46% of the cases utilizing the Renaissance systems were minimal invasive spine cases. Including multi-level cases, which were performed in minimal invasive physical approach. This figure significantly exceeded the broader market share figure for minimal invasive procedures, which are estimate at the range of 12% to 13% of instrumented spine cases.
These are mainly limited to single level cases with only 8% of MIS fusion being two-level cases and even more early three or more levels except by a handful of surgeons and center. However, some of our surgeon customers were seeing growth in multi-level MIS cases, which are enabled by Renaissance, including for example at one level, 12 level MIS fusion in an 86-year-old patient performed in a standard community hospital.
Surgeonsâ geography and adoption play critical role in converting more surgeons to utilize their Renaissance and experience its benefit. Our wide position to surgeons is very compelling. Our systems allow them to be better organized and prepared before surgery and more efficient during the actual procedure. All was significantly reducing their exposure to radiation.
As an example, two surgeons, who have adopted the Renaissance systems into their practice, are continuing to show remarkable results. They are both in Florida and many of you met them at our recent demonstration at the last conference.
Dr. Andrew Cannestra, the distinguished neurosurgeon from Jacksonville, is performing more complex cases since integrating the Renaissance into his practice and his fatherâs experienced the value of Renaissance. They also decided to purse -- to purchase their second Renaissance system to avoid conflicts in booking the system for operation.
A second surgeon, Dr. Thomas Greene from Tampa, Florida moved from performing only about 40% of his cases in MIS abroad to 100%. These examples show how the Renaissance systems allow surgeons and hospitals to build patient volume as well as perform more complex surgeries with higher investment, with the technology that offer a very high ROI.
The examples I just highlighted benefit surgeons but also the hospitals as case volume and efficiently increased while reducing risks. For these reasons the level of interest and engagement is increasing. We know from experience that eight out of 10 surgeons that tried the system basically love, become advocate from role at the administration level. However, we can rely thoroughly on them to secure system sale, especially as the market environment has changed since we first launched Renaissance in the U.S. market.
In some cases, we thought we had concluded a sale only to learn that the hospital wanted us to win over a different surgeon champion or recruit a surgeon from another hospital. By increasing our interaction with hospital administration at the senior level, we expect to better assess the level of interest during each stage of the third quarter avoid such supplier and improve predictability of the timing of the purchase decision.
We have also succeeded in developing clusters in the U.S. market in Florida, Texas, Southern California and more recently Georgia. We purposely focused on these early markets to build the awareness and the effectiveness of the system. With the level of success we have achieved to-date weâre focusing our efforts and resources on penetrating the major metropolitan areas where vast majority of the addressable market of over 400,000 procedures are performed.
To help create awareness to Mazor and position us for future sales, we are actually recruiting additional talented capital sales reps with a preference for build with a high level of familiarity with the spine market and was experienced in selling high priced innovating technology to hospitals.
As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing the high level of interest throughout area both from a system growth perspective and procedure volume. Over a year ago we recognized emerging possibilities and set up our sales and marketing efforts in the region.
In Taiwan, we sold our first system two years ago and utilization of that system has been impressive. Over 400 procedures to-date in a single hospital and in the third quarter 2015 alone performed over 50 cases.
In Australia, the two hospitals with Renaissance system have conducted major media campaigns as they differentiate themselves from neighboring hospitals. We anticipate that this will translate into future system sales in this market. We are working closely with our distribution partners to increase our presence. And in March, we held direct lab in Sydney. We have three more plans for the remainder of the year to meet the rising interest in the system.
With regard to China, we sold two systems in the second half of 2014 and we are working closely with our distribution partners to raise the awareness of the Renaissance system. We have a number of planned events to develop a robust pipeline, including implementing the robust marketing campaign. Dr. Isador Lieberman from Texas Back Institute will be spending two weeks in China to perform surgeries with more than 20 surgeons attending his cases.
We continue to see interest from existing users of Renaissance as well as from new release in the brain model. We are rapidly closing on a milestone and expect to surpass the 100 brain procedure in the U.S. in the current quarter. As we stated, we anticipate that the brain model will be used primarily for deep brain stimulation surgeries or DBS. DBS procedures are currently used mainly to treat human disorder, such as Parkinsonâs disease. However, this novel treatment is being referred for other possible indications, including the potential market size and more companies are entering this growing market with new equipment.
As an example, I want to share a case that was performed in U.S., by Dr. Vansickle, a neurosurgeon in South Denver Neurosurgery. He was the first physician to utilize the Renaissance guiding system to successful perform the DBS procedure to treat obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD on a 30-year twin at the Littleton Adventist Hospital in Littleton Colorado, which was one of the first hospital to consider system primarily for the brain applications.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, OCD affects over 2% of the U.S. population between the ages of 18 to 54, representing a total population of 3.3 million. These are in additional 1 million children and adolescence with a disorder. If left untreated, OCD symptoms might become progressively worse, making it difficult to function at school, work and at home.
Treatment is therefore crucial. Initial approach to OCD treatment includes pharmacological, therapeutic, and self-help methods. However, when severe OCD proves resistant to the typical standard of care, physicians may turn to DBS as a surgical option as DBS was cleared by the FDA for OCD in 2009.
Before I hand the call over to Sharon to review the financial results for the first quarter, I want to highlight our growth strategy. First, we are committed to growing our market footprint. As I mentioned earlier, we have hired and are hiring capital sales team in major metropolitan areas. And we are working closely with our international distribution partners to penetrate new hospital and countries. Iâm also in accord with the discussions we are having with academics.
Second, we are focused on increasing system utilization. This is critical indicator to future Renaissance Systems sales and the strong utilization we experienced in the first quarter demonstrate our clinical sales reps are collaborating closely with surgeons and hospital administration.
Third, our objective is to deliver product enhancements regularly to maintain a high level of surgeon satisfaction. We upgraded our focus in Q1 providing enhancement and improvements to our product based on inputs we received from our surgeon customers.
We are in the process of developing tools and techniques that will allow them to perform certain procedures with greater ease. We believe these improvements will go a long way with clinical adoption and widening the clinical range in which spine surgeon uses Renaissance.
And last, we promote scientific data that supports our value proposition. We have mentioned in previous calls three studies that are focused on the procedure where we see Renaissanceâs greater contributions, mainly complex [indiscernible] fusion, peri-operative deformity and short MIS fusion. All three are perspective and controlled. The studies are very large and realistically it will take a couple of years or more before we will see significant data coming out of them. So far we have recruited around 30 patients in each one of the study and is too early to make conclusion or share any of the results.
I would also like to share that Dr. Dennis Devito of Children's Orthopedics of Atlanta was an invited speaker in teaching symposium at American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The symposium held on March 24 was called Introducing Spine Imaging and Navigation Technology To Your Practice : What is Available, What Do I Need It -- Why Do I Need It and How Do I Pay For It? Dr. Devito has presented in [indiscernible] of published evidence that demonstrated a statistical significant reductions in both complications and revisions in surgery performed with Renaissance compared to freehand.
This results from the accuracy that Renaissance delivered as well as from itâs enabling minimally invasive technique surgeon who would otherwise operate in an open approach. As you can see, we are seeing positive trends in all five of these areas supporting my confidence that we will demonstrate growth in 2015.
Now to review the financial highlights of the quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori, and hello everyone. I will review our financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Revenue was $4.5 million, which was slightly down compared to the year ago first quarter, reflecting a lower number of system sales, partially offset by procedure growth. Geographically revenue in the U.S. was $2.7 million or 61% of total revenue, with $1.8 million or 39% of revenue from international markets.
Capital sales revenue was $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 down from $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2014 as we sold three systems in the quarter compared to five systems in the year ago first quarter.
I would like to take the opportunity and share further breakdown between disposable kits sales and service and other. Revenue from disposable kits sales grew to $1.6 million, a 45% increase compared to $1.1 million in the last year first quarter, reflecting the increase in number of procedures as well as same-store base.
Revenue generated from service and others were $1.1 million compared to $0.9 million in the year ago quarter. GAAP Gross margin remain as high as 75.7% for the quarter, down compared to year ago period due to lower system sales. Operating expense were $8.5 million compared to $7.5 million in the year ago first quarter. The increase in expense primarily due to our continued investments in sales and marketing that Ori highlighted earlier in his remarks.
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the first quarter was $5.2 million or $0.12 per share compared to net loss of $3.6 million or $0.09 per share in the 2014 first quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the period was $4.4 million or $0.11 per share compared to $3.2 million or $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter was $4.2 million compared to $5.3 million in the last yearâs first quarter.
The increase in cash used for operating activity mainly reflects the company efforts to raise awareness of its Renaissance system. As of March 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $48 million, which provides ample resource to execute our business plans.
That concludes my remarks. And I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary comments and then we will take questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. In summary, my objectives and that of the Robotics team is to ensure we convert the rising interests of Renaissance into meaningful results. We have a tremendous market opportunity in front of us and we have only penetrated a fraction of the hospitals and less than 2% of the almost 400,000 annual cases performed during 2015.
I believe our efforts to increase awareness and data supporting the clinical and economic benefit of the Renaissance Systems, along with the continued increase in customersâ utilization position at Mazor to accelerate the adoption and make Renaissance the some of the few.
Thank you again for joining the call. Operator, we are now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mr. Jeffrey Cohen, Ladenburg Thalmann & Company. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning, Orion and Sharon. How are you?
Ori Hadomi
Good morning.
Sharon Levita
Thank you. Good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen
So essentially two questions or two topics, if you could discuss in further detail weâd appreciate. So firstly, if you could talk about the size currently of the sales and marketing effort in the U.S. as far as numbers and what kind of numbers you expect to get to during 2015? And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about the U.S. market and the backlog in funnel and size, breadth and range and how that looks in the short and near-term? Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Okay. Sure. So, I will start with the sales effort and the team. We made several changes and are continuing to hire people. Right now, we have 12 team members and we plan to get to 16. We are considering even to get some by more than the 16. We are focusing our efforts in specific areas, different from what we had in the past where we had our team spread out all around the country.
Now, we will try to focus and to benefit, to gain the benefit, focus and scale in specific areas, we believe that there is a clear opportunity and gets the benefit of the competition weâd hoped for. For the first time, we hired four people in the New York area and now in New Jersey and recently also in the Northeast in Boston. So, we are taking steps to focus on the big metropolitan cites, both in West as well as in the -- both in the East as well as in the West.
As to your question about the pipeline, I stated earlier when we released the results, number fifth in the beginning of the quarter that obviously the first quarter and numbers it was below what we expected. But I feel very strongly that we can meet the 2015 -- our objectives for 2015 and without being specific about our expectations in numbers because we donât give guidance. It is definitely -- we are definitely relating to showing real growth relative to 2014. What I see now in the market from our team is very, very different from all what they saw in previous quarter.
The discussions, engagement, the correspondence with our administration, we never experienced this level of relationship and I feel and believe that the effort that we put in the last few quarters will be converted to their ability to close deals in the coming three quarters. So, I feel -- I must say I feel optimistic. I believe that we can meet objectives and as I always said, sometimes itâs hard to close the deal on the last day or the last week of the quarter, I believe that when you look at it, by the end of the year you will see if we are able to close the gap and meet our objectives that I think we will show significant growth in 2014.
Jeffrey Cohen
Thank you. And one quick one. Whatâs the total employee count on the company now?
Ori Hadomi
The totalâ¦
Sharon Levita
Itâs around 145.
Ori Hadomi
145.
Jeffrey Cohen
Thank you very much.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Jeff.
Operator
The next question is from Matt Taylor, Barclays. Please go ahead.
Young Lee
Hi, guys. This is actually Young Lee in for Matt Taylor. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, a quick one to start on, Iâm just wondering can you talk about the $200,000 in commissions, is that related to the Taiwan sale. Seems like itâs one-time in nature but how important was that to getting that deal closed and if you think that might continue in some of the other geographic sales?
Sharon Levita
Thank you. This is Sharon. This is a one-time because we had different circumstances why we were approached directly by hospitals to purchase a system in Taiwan. And since we have an exclusive distributor in Taiwan, who is going to take care of everything to do from installations, training and supporting, this is why and itâs a one-time event. We donât expect many more of them.
Young Lee
Okay. Great. And can you maybe make some comments about the competitive front? I know you mentioned that you think competition is going to come more likely a couple years down the line but just wondering if thatâs still way you are thinking?
Ori Hadomi
I think that itâs still early. In terms of competition, I donât think that anything significant happened different from what we focused during the last two years. We do believe that sometime around 2017, we will begin to see more players coming with fine robotics to the market. We are putting a lot of effort in order to increase our impact and have a significant footprint in the market.
However, the market is still big that I believe that having another one or two players in the market in a way and direct and indirectly will just support our effort. We need more companies to put marketing campaigns, develop awareness. I feel very comfortable and confident that other companies will come.
We have an advantage, given the significant clinical experience that we have and once we get the ability to compare between the technologies, I feel we will be in a superior, secure position. I like that the four companies will come. I think it will support the market. It will convert robotics to a standard of care and things for the benefit, for the patients, the hospitals and the industry.
Young Lee
All right. Great. Thank you very much.
Ori Hadomi
Welcome.
Operator
Next question is from Dave Turkaly, JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Dave Turkaly
Thanks. Just quickly going to the sales force metrics and I just took my notes for capital sales reps. And I think we had some like 16 in 4Q or 18 in 3Q, but as some others, the managers and directors on top. So the 12, is that comparable to those numbers or are there -- could you maybe talk about who sits over there and that the third-party you selling organization as well?
Ori Hadomi
Sure. The 12 that we have includes everyone. It includes the VP, the regional directors and the Area Sales Managers. Iâm referring to the capital team only. Iâm not referring to the clinical team. We have two sales groups, one responsible to support the cases. In the clinical sales specialist, we have 42 team members in this team and we have another team thatâs dedicated to the sales of complete unit and there we have 12, headed by VP and with two Regional Sales Directors.
Dave Turkaly
Okay. So implies that base is a little lower than it was in the past. So have you lost people and replaced them with different folks in these major metropolitan areas, or I guess just your thoughts on how that happened?
Ori Hadomi
We have 14 and we move to 12, and we are hiring now and in â16 and more.
Dave Turkaly
Okay. And then on to your -- the kit revenue, you talked about that 25% growth. Just curious ASP wise, how are those holding up? I mean, obviously people talk about a lot of pricing pressure in spine. So, I was just curious if -- per procedure if you guys are able to maintain, right and possibly raise pricing, any color on what price was for you guys?
Ori Hadomi
Right. So, we donât see, we donât experience any real pressure on the disposable price. And in fact, we even -- when weâre looking at our average price or incomes per kit, it has been increased in the last few quarters continuously. So we donât see any real pressures there and the price has maintained and even been raised.
Dave Turkaly
Thanks a lot.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
We have a question from Mike Matson, Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir.
Mike Matson
Thanks. So you gave your current number of reps. I was just wondering, you mentioned, youâre going to add some capital rep? So do you have a specific target there and are you also try to add any reps on the clinical side as well?
Ori Hadomi
Yes and yes. As I mentioned earlier, we are hiring more people both for the capital and I mentioned that we are targeting the third pace to get the 16 and geographically-wise we are focusing on the East and the West Coast and less in Central of the country. And as to the clinical team, the hiring is correlated to the -- to our growth in number of systems, well, with the specific ratio. So thatâs according to our standard ratio.
Mike Matson
Okay. Thanks. And then I was just wondering if you could give us an update on your international markets, specifically which countries have the largest number of Renaissance systems?
Ori Hadomi
Yeah. From looking in the international markets, both of our [indiscernible] between I would say, Taiwan, Australia, Germany, and these are the highest level of activities there. We are beginning to put to make -- took some effort in few other countries in Asia, as well as increasing the activity in India and some other countries in the Europe.
However, I believe that, if we are looking at the coming 12, 24 months, I believe that most of the activity will take place in Asia. We believe there are high level of uncertainty right now about China and I believe in the coming two quarters will be very important in letting us learn more about how can we -- how to convert and to what extent we are successful in converting the very high level of success and interest by the surgeons to deals.
I can tell you that I hear specifically from surgeons in U.S. that they will approach on the daily base, by Chinese surgeons that they are asking to come and see Renaissance cases and that is one of the reasons why in the coming -- in the near future we will support several different marketing activities in China in order to further explore the Chinese surgeons to their technology and develop more awareness and with a clinical results and the technology.
However, it will take some time to see the commercial implications of that. We are very satisfied with our partner there and I believe that in the coming two quarters weâd be able to know more.
Mike Matson
Okay. And then actually just on -- can you give us an update on Japanese regulatory approval and launch of the product?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. The Japanese regulatory process is on track. We donât expect, as I mention also in previous calls, this is a very long and complicated process. We donât expect it before mid of next year and I hope it will as we concluded before the end of next year. But we need -- we have few milestones before and then Iâll have better clarity. So but it is moving forward.
Mike Matson
All right. Great. That's all I have. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Operator
[Operator instructions] The next question is from Craig Bijou, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Craig Bijou
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking our questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.
Craig Bijou
I wanted to dive a little deeper into utilization comments. Ori, I think at a recent conference you said that, about a third of the installed base does about 150 procedures or more per year and based on your average utilization for the year a little more than 70? I think that, if my math is correct that makes -- that makes two thirds of the installed base system, I mean, roughly 35 procedures a year? One, I wanted to see if I thinking about that correctly? And then two, is there a reason for the lower utilization and what exactly are you guys doing to try to bump up the utilization in the lower two thirds?
Ori Hadomi
I think this will add to our confusion. The numbers that I mentioned were read between 70 to 80 and I did say that we have about thirds, three different thirds, one third doing more than 100 to 120 and other one is doing between 40 to 100 -- between 60 to 100 and I said that there is a round third that is doing less than 60. But -- and the average is around 74, 75 something like that. We are -- we are doing a lot of things. We are very satisfied, I must say, with level of utilization as well as the growth in the number of procedures that is done by the system.
However, they always want to do more. And one of the things that we have done recently is we met these specific accounts where we sold utilizations below our expectations. And with this two different things, we dedicated special team, our clinical sales team to work closely in these hospitals in order to retrain, engage and do whatever needed in order to get the surgeons unit more often and gain the confidence thatâs one thing that we did.
In another hospital, where the system were not in use due to really very objective and unfortunate reasons in one hospitals because the -- a surgeon had passed away and he was the only user, and there was another hospital where there was inquisition of the hospitals and the change in the spine group and they didnât do it. We basically encouraged and supported the transition of the systems to other hospitals in order to gain utilization.
I expect that all these movements will take place during this quarter and the next quarter and it will have also an impact on the continuous growth in the utilization. So we are very aware and sensitive and we are taking measures of those by training, supporting and marketing as well as by working with the partners in the accounts in order to make the right move and where needed even to move systems in new hospitals in order to get a nice utilization.
Craig Bijou
Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And thanks for the clarification on the numbers. Secondly I just want to ask broadly speaking how do you think about potential strategic partnerships? And I guess have you -- would you be open to them. Have you had discussions with maybe some other spine companies that have -- that are focused on complex spine or minimally invasive procedures?
Ori Hadomi
Yeah. No, I think that when we are looking in the future sales of Mazor, we believe that our growth engine will consist on few different elements. We definitely need to significantly increase our impact and awareness and partnering with partners that are -- that have solid presence in the market can help. We also believe and I said it also in the past that we should expand our offering and include more wider range of disposables products that have a synergy with our product, number one, in order to increase our revenues for case, but also to be able to put in some of the customers more flexible and a wider range of various models to fund that through the system. We are active in controlling these opportunities and when and if something will be significant enough to report, we will do it accordingly.
Craig Bijou
Great. Thanks for taking the question.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you very much Craig.
Operator
Due to time constrains, we have time for one more question. The last question is from Greg Chodazcek with CRT Capital. Please go ahead sir.
Greg Chodazcek
Thank you. Hi Ori and Sharon. Just a quick one. You talked about 80% of the surgeons who tried Renaissance become an advocate for the system. Typically, are these surgeons who do complex cases, are they MIS doctors. Iâm just trying to feel, trying to figure out, what type of doctor is going to the hospital and requesting a Renaissance?
Ori Hadomi
Okay. So we are targeting, I would say two main group of surgeons. One, these are the surgeons, who are doing the complex cases. But I want to say that the vast majority of the surgeons, who are doing the complex cases, they donât do it minimal-invasively. There are only very few that doing complex cases, the big 6, 7, 10 levels [indiscernible] minimal-invasively. The vast majority is doing it widely open.
The second segment that weâre targeting are these that are doing them degenerative diseases cases, whether itâs 1, 2, 3, or 4 levels, some of these about 12% to 15% of them doing it minimal-invasively. The vast majority of the surgeons doing these cases, they want to do it minimal-invasively, but theyâre concerned with many different reasons and they donât do it minimal-invasively.
These two segments are the segments that weâre targeting. What we felt that when we will bring surgeons to develop or to take a physician based on all statistics about eight out of 10, there is a 10 that could develop and had a hands-on on the system becomes a support that it actually takes upto them inflation and often inflations to -- he supporting from the administration to purchase. As we all know, the support of the surgeon not fairly converge immediately to transaction but the clinical support comes from these two segments.

And the reason I asked is, the pushback from the hospital, is it the number of doctors who go to the administration and says we would like a Renaissance or is it a type of doctor? So if you have a doctor who does very complex cases and says the Renaissance would help, is it an easier sale for them or is it just you need a certain amount of doctors?
Ori Hadomi
Right. I think that two or three different reasons. If you ask me based on my interpretation, one has to do with the importance and the political power of the surgeon himself in the hospital. Very often when we approach them, the surgeons and they support us, never though independent if they are doing complex or doing simple cases.
If they are already employed by the hospital, the hospital administration often time wants to bring new surgeon. Because they have these already in the hospital and they want to leverage the investment in the capital equipments in order to be able to attract new surgeons and improve their -- increase the number of cases in the hospital. So thatâs the one reason.
Another reason sometime has to do they want to get coalition from different groups in the hospital and they actually wait for decision until there is a support by a larger group of surgeons in the hospital, which takes time and they always come to this at a very end. And the third which may explain everything, even when we see, there is often time half notes are not in made decision.
They will take their systems if we are also ready, we want to buy it and we will buy it. Do you mind if it will be pushed in another quarter or two just because we need. And the surgeons have the limited power in the hospital. So the combination of all the three competing with others, developing coalition and the hesitant sometimes to make decisions based on our time priority all are in fact doing the further decision proper.
