Good morning, and welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Webcast and Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead, sir.
Brad Whitmarsh - Noble Energy, Inc.
Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review our third quarter 2016 operational and financial new release, which highlights once again robust outperformance for Noble Energy. We've also posted a few supplemental slides on our website and later today, we anticipate filing our 10-Q with the SEC.
Following our prepared comments, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would ask that the analysts limit themselves to one primary and one follow-up. Dave Stover, Chairman and CEO; and Gary Willingham, EVP of Operations will provide some commentary, while Ken Fisher, EVP and CFO; and Keith Elliot, SVP of our Eastern Med Assets will join for Q&A.
I want to remind everyone that this event may contain projections and forward-looking statements as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items. Before highlighting our performance for the third quarter, I want to ensure you all saw the announcement that Noble Energy will be hosting an additional webcast in just two weeks, on November 16, at 9 o'clock AM Central Time. Our team is looking forward to providing a long-term outlook. Focusing on the company's U.S. onshore operations, so you'll understand today if we save our plans for 2017 and beyond.
Now, let's get to the numbers. Total volumes for the quarter were 425,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 12% in absolute and 8% pro forma over the third quarter of last year. Versus our internal expectations, total volumes were 15,000 barrels equivalent per day above the midpoint of our range.
By business unit, this was the result of higher-than-expected volumes in the DJ Basin, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. Our hydrocarbon, oil was a significant outperformer comprising nearly 60% of the higher number. NGLs were also higher and natural gas volumes reflected a record quarter from Tamar in Israel.
We want to highlight that across the board nearly every unit cost item came in under expectations as well. This was the result of higher-than-forecasted production and continued capital efficiency and cost control. The higher volumes and lower costs contributed to a meaningful earnings and cash flow beat for the quarter. Financial liquidity at the end of the third quarter grew to nearly $6 billion, including $1.8 billion in cash.
During the quarter, we received approximately $300 million following the very successful Noble Midstream IPO. As Noble Energy is the general partner, Noble Midstream's results are fully consolidated into Noble's financials. You probably noticed some specific adjustments in our earnings release tables to reflect the new public entity both on the income statement and the balance sheet where we have identified the portion attributable to the non-controlling interest. Dave will talk more about the success of NBLX, and how it positions us with competitive advantages for the future.
With that, I'll turn the call to Dave.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. After being unable to engage with you for the last couple of months due to the timing of our Midstream IPO, I've been looking forward to this opportunity to share what Noble has accomplished. And we've accomplished a lot.
As you look at our operating and financial numbers, they are up where we want them to be up and down where we want them to be down. Last quarter, I commented that Noble Energy was executing at the highest levels I've seen in my time with the company. Results from the most recent quarter solidify that view even further.
Taking a look at slide 3, we've delivered tremendous results everywhere. Volumes, product mix, cost control and cash generation. We're delivering everything we set out to accomplish in 2016 and more, much more. Yet the numbers are only a part of the story, we've also recently accomplished some big things that are strategically significant to our future.
These include: the highly successful launch of the Noble Midstream IPO; the separation of the Marcellus JV to provide both companies independent control of their future development; the signing of Leviathan's first sizeable sales export contract; a significant debt reduction that help support our long-term growth plans; and an acceleration of our onshore development program. All of this was accomplished while delivering top quartile debt adjusted production and cash flow growth in 2016.
Looking beyond 2016, we will provide a view into our future at the November 16 investor event. The combination of our exceptional portfolio, leading operational execution and financial strength and flexibility provide significant competitive advantages, differentiates our future, our growth potential and our value.
This morning, I'd like to spend a few moments on a number of the recent major accomplishments mentioned. Steps along the path in delivering our future; steps that are enhancing our ability to accelerate our growth; and steps that are generating industry-leading returns.
Starting with operational execution, the momentum we've generated in every area of the business continues to deliver outstanding results. We highlighted in last night's release a number of new wells in the DJ Basin, Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to push the leading edge of enhanced completions across our onshore business, and we remain encouraged by the productivity and capital efficiency improvements.
We've recently added two rigs to our U.S. drilling programs, bringing our total onshore rig count to six, two in the DJ, two in the Eagle Ford, and two in the Delaware. Based upon our current view of pricing, we're positioned for additional activity increases in 2017. In the Eastern Mediterranean, third quarter volumes were outstanding. They reflect the high seasonal period in Israel and also the government's continued focus on increased dependence on gas usage for power generation. We've also made excellent progress on Leviathan, and have line of sight on projects sanctioned around the end of the year or early next year.
And in our other offshore areas, we benefited from strong reservoir and facility performance at Gunflint in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alba compression projection in Equatorial Guinea. Both are producing at higher rates than expected.
Beyond operations excellence, we've continued to strengthen our financial position. The successful IPO of our Noble Midstream business highlights tremendous work by Terry Gerhart and the Midstream team. With the IPO proceeds, this public vehicle has already returned the capital investments made in those assets back to Noble. The long-term value potential for both Noble and the NBLX unitholders is substantial.
Slide 4 highlights the NBLX assets, and on slide 5, we've shown a combined valuation in Noble for both Noble Midstream as well as CONE. In total, we estimate a Midstream value for Noble at over $2.5 billion. This value is expected to grow quickly as we move into 2017 and beyond.
Including the initial distribution from NBLX, we've generated almost $1.5 billion in portfolio proceeds this year, and increased total liquidity to nearly $6 billion. We are in the enviable position of being able to accelerate development activity while also reducing leverage to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. We're doing precisely what we have said we would do all year.
Since the end of the third quarter, we've paid down $850 million of our term loan. With free cash flow being generated organically and expected portfolio proceeds, we still estimate that at the end of the year, we will have well over $5 billion in liquidity on hand.
The third area of competitive advantage is our portfolio. Earlier this week, we, along with CONSOL, announced an intent to dissolve the upstream Marcellus joint venture. It's now been five years since we entered the asset with CONSOL. The accomplishments over that time period have been remarkable. Significant ramps in both production and recoverable resources have highlighted the strong coordination and technical excellence of both companies.
Over the last several months, the parties focused on how to maximize value and flexibility. We agreed to split the upstream acreage and production in such a way that each party controls 100% of its assets and future activity. Noble will retain 100% working interest in 363,000 acres, and current production of approximately 450 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We will keep our core wet gas Marcellus operations in Majorsville and Moundsville, including the Utica potential in Moundsville and substantial gas inventory for future development. You can see a before and after look of the transaction on slide 7. Closing is anticipated before year-end.
I'd like to personally express my appreciation to both the CONSOL and Noble teams that have worked so well together for the past five years. There're no changes to the CONE midstream ownership, acreage dedications, or services. We will continue to work with CONSOL as sponsors to enhance the value of that business. Other recent portfolio optimization efforts have included the DJ Basin acreage trade and the initial sell-down of our Tamar interest. We anticipate the Tamar transaction will close during the fourth quarter.
On the topic of portfolio, I want to address the recent market speculation around Noble's interest in a potential Permian bolt-on acquisition. Let me be clear. We feel no urgency, nor have any desire to bid up prices in the basin. And as always, we will be patient and selective in evaluating any additions to our position in the heart of the Delaware play. We remain focused on increasing drilling activity in our existing position. And we'll highlight during our call in two weeks, how dramatically and quickly we can grow our volumes and increase our value there.
Each step we've made over the last couple of years, including those mentioned today, has been centered on enhancing our future and the value potential for shareholders. Our company is well positioned and focused. Our capital is prioritized to accelerate our Delaware Basin asset, develop our DJ and Eagle Ford positions, and post sanction implement the first phase of Leviathan. These things will be clear on the investor call in two weeks.
Now, let me hand the call over to Gary to walk through our excellent operating performance.
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share with you on November 16, so I'll keep my comments relatively short today.
Let's start with the DJ Basin. Third quarter production totaled 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That's several thousand barrels equivalent per day higher than expected. This resulted from continued success with enhanced completions and relatively low-lying pressures throughout the basin. Majority of our activity in the DJ Basin continues to focus on the Wells Ranch and East Pony areas, although we also brought online several Mustang wells during the quarter.
In total, we commenced production on 43 wells with proppant concentration averaging over 1,600 pounds per lateral foot. I'm particularly encouraged about some DJ wells that have recently come on production testing even higher proppant concentrations, 2,000 pounds plus. And we should have some Wells Ranch higher intensity results for you on the call in a couple of weeks.
During the quarter, we completed the previously announced strategic acreage trade with PDC Energy, which expanded our Wells Ranch position by approximately 20%. This transaction is consistent with our strategy to focus on areas with higher oil content where we have more contiguous acreage and can drive efficiency gains through longer lateral development and existing infrastructure. For Noble, this transaction added substantial value to our forward development plans.
Moving to Texas, we continued our successes in the Delaware with the Johnny Ringo 9 3H well. The well is nearly 5,000 feet in lateral length and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per lateral foot and slickwater fluid, another outstanding well. One of the top two industry wells in the third quarter in the basin.
Total production from the well is almost 1,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 70% oil. With the second rig added to our position there, the pace of our drilling and completions will ramp up quickly. Fourth quarter activity will be higher than the first three quarters of the year combined with an even further acceleration into 2017. I'm excited about the fact that we are now doing our first pad drilling in our first long lateral wells.
Also, we will soon be testing multiple zones beyond the Wolfcamp A that we have in the heart of the Delaware Basin. Over in the Eagle Ford, we announced strong results from new wells in Gates Ranch. The five Lower Eagle Ford wells we brought online in the quarter had 500-foot lateral spacing at an average lateral length of nearly 5,900 feet. IP-30 rates have averaged more than 3,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
During the third quarter, we shut in 33 Eagle Ford wells for about a month to perform offset fracs. In the fourth quarter, we're bringing on a number of new wells in Briscoe Ranch including a couple in the Upper Eagle Ford. And they will be Noble's first test of this potentially large resource.
Dave mentioned earlier the recent production performances at Tamar. As a result of the increasing Israeli gas demand outlook, we've recently commenced drilling an additional development well at Tamar. This well will provide reliability and additional production capacity.
At Leviathan, we are continuing to target a final investment decision around year-end or early next year. We've now contracted up to 450 million cubic feet per day for 15 years equating to estimated gross revenues of more than $12 billion. Our recent contract with the National Electric Power Company of Jordan represents the first Leviathan export contract. We look forward to supplying gas to Jordan for many years into the future.
The Leviathan FEED work continues, and we're making substantial progress on all of the bids and awards. Over the next couple of months, we expect to finalize remaining key milestones for sanction. This includes additional domestic sales contracts and financing plans, as well as completion of the engineering work, project cost estimates and required construction permits.
Offshore, in the Gulf of Mexico, we brought online our Gunflint development in mid-July. This is a third Middle Miocene tieback to commence production in the last 12 months. And these three contributed to the more than doubling of our Gulf of Mexico volumes over the last year. The net amount from Gunflint to Noble Energy during the quarter was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This is higher than expected due to additional open capacity at the host facility.
We continue to see strong production from the Big Bend and Dantzler fields during the quarter, and recently celebrated the one-year anniversary in both of these fields.
We provided fourth quarter 2016 guidance on slide 8. As mentioned in the press release, we are increasing our fourth quarter capital guidance to $425 million to $475 million reflecting the rig additions and higher activity levels. Even with this activity fits (16:51) acceleration, we will still be well under $1.5 billion in capital this year.
We've maintained our previous fourth quarter volume guidance despite the impact of asset divestitures that were not previously modeled. Otherwise, we would have projected above the high end of our 400,000 barrel to 410,000 barrel equivalent per day range. The largest of these transactions is the Marcellus JV separation that Dave talked through earlier.
With the close anticipated in November, we expect about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day impact on the fourth quarter. Making up the difference is higher volumes than previously expected in the DJ Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, which also contribute to a slightly higher oil mix for the quarter as well. We also reduced a few of our cost item expectations for the fourth quarter, including LOE and G&A.
There are a lot of catalysts to look forward to as we approach 2017. Drilling activity is accelerating. The effectiveness of enhanced completions in all basins continues to improve, and we are leveraging our onshore infrastructure advantage with NBLX. In addition, our offshore assets continue to generate substantial cash flows to the business and a sanction at Leviathan is near.
We'll have much more to show in two weeks. I hope you'll plan to join us then as well. And at this time, we'll go ahead and open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we'll go first to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Good morning. Dave, obviously doing an off-cycle kind of update call in November, I know you're going to leave the details to November 16. But I did want to ask you, clearly, I think you think the guys maybe miss it or the investors may be missing something from a bigger picture standpoint. What do you think the market may be missing as we think about Noble relative to your peers and what do you hope to accomplish with that call?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Arun, I appreciate the question, and also the plug for the 16th. I think, no doubt. We want to highlight just the performance and the long-term expectation performance of our onshore business. I think that gets lost a little bit at times, and I think we can do a great job of laying that out. And also just what we're focusing on, where we expect to spend capital and what are going to be the growth drivers for us that went out of our multiple years. And that I think just making that clear since we really haven't had a chance to give a bigger picture, longer term outlook for a few years now. As we've maneuvered through the last couple years, I think we want to highlight how bright the future is for us.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Makes a lot of sense. And just one quick modeling question. On the Eagle Ford, I know you guided to this last quarter, but your Texas volumes were impacted on a sequential basis by the shut-in of 33 wells. I know you brought on five in the quarter. How should we think about shut-ins in the Eagle Ford going forward? Is this an unusually high level of shut-ins and how do we think about that perhaps going forward?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah, Arun. I think having 33 wells shut-in, I would say, is unusually high, but shutting it off that wells to frac new completions is standard in the area. We've had some of that all along. Rosetta had some of that in the past. So, we'll continue to have that going forward, but 33 wells was an unusually high number I would say.
Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Operator
We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. My first question is, can you guys discuss the strategic drivers on the dissolution of the CNX JV? And given the assets unlikely that could be for capital versus the balance sheet portfolio, should we expect the disposition or do you view the asset as a gas option worth holding? Any comments?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
No. I think the driver was, as we progressed and I think Nic addressed this on his call the other day too, but as we progressed over time, and you just looked at the different portfolios for both companies, it made a lot of sense to set it up to where we each could control our own development plans and our own future going forward. So, I think that was the driver. And pure and simple. We had a great relationship for the five years and delivered a tremendous amount of value. But as you look forward and looked at it from a, just the whole portfolio aspect for each company, it made a lot of sense to set it up where each company could operate, and drive at 100%, their own portion of it.
I think when we look at it going forward, we like the position we have there, especially the ability to control the timing and pace of development. And so, we'll just see how that plays out, then look at it relative to the returns of the other parts of our portfolio as we make decisions on capital allocation. But we like the position. It does give some nice option value and the best gas basin in the U.S., and it's still a significant position.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. And maybe that'll be clear on November 16 when we see the forward capital spend. My second question, or a few questions on the Delaware, and I realize it's early there. Given your contiguous position and long lateral leadership in the DJ, when do you expect to test longer laterals? And then on the zones, you drilled four successful wells in the Upper Wolfcamp with strong results. When are you planning to test the Bone Springs and Lower Wolfcamp A? I'll leave it there.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. I'll let probably Gary comment on a minute, but definitely, that's one of the areas we'll highlight our plans on November 16, so Gary can talk a little bit more specific about some of those aspects.
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. I think we're headed that direction now. We noted in the press release that we just (23:27) our first long laterals in the Delaware, it was almost 7,800-foot lateral length. As you know, we've got a nice contiguous position there, and the ability to drill more long laterals going forward. And I think you'll see us do that, just like you've seen that transition in the DJ, where we averaged over 9,000-foot in lateral length in the third quarter.
As far as the other zones go, we've mentioned in the past that we're testing or drilling our first Lower Wolfcamp A well and our first Bone Spring well this quarter. They won't be on in fourth quarter. They won't come on till next year. But those will be the first tests of those zones that Noble has drilled. And so, we look forward to those results next year.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Appreciate it, guys.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Thanks, Evan.

We'll go next to Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Good morning, Scott.
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Hi, Scott.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, if I could ask the Marcellus question in a different way, when you look at where returns are, based on strip prices at the Marcellus, how does that rank with some of your plays? And maybe you all will be giving some more specifics in a couple weeks, but just generalized, can you compete with the DJ and Eagle Ford and Permian right now?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, yeah. Obviously, it depends on longer term gas price, and we'll see how that plays out. Right now, I think it's been pretty clear. Our capital allocation has been in DJ, Delaware and Eagle Ford right now, and I don't see that changing near term. I think in the Marcellus, we'll continue to watch how gas price plays out. I think we've always talked about this and (25:08) keep kind of improving netbacks in a $3 type gas price. There's still a nice portion of it that'll compete well over time. And I think, as we've talked about, we'll lay that longer term picture out here in a couple weeks.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I appreciate that. And as a follow-up question, in the Permian, you all have added a rig, you're up at two right now. Logistically, on the footprints you have right now, what do you think your max capacity of being able to run rigs on that position is, and maybe it's wells, not rigs, but just generalized, can you run four rigs, five rigs, six rigs on that position? What is your view over the long-term on that asset?
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Scott, you'll see a lot more on that here on November 16. I'd say the range you put out there, it's a realistic range, probably at the lower end of that range on a rig count over time, given the efficiencies we expect to continue to generate there and drilling more wells with fewer rigs, just like we've seen in the DJ over time. But for now, we've added a second rig. We'll ramp up activity from there. We'll make sure that we can do it in an efficient and safe manner, and we'll talk more on November 16 about how quickly we increase it further from there.
Scott Hanold - RBC Capital Markets LLC

We'll go next to Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thank you. Good morning.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Good morning, Brian.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Shifting a bit to international, you mentioned the FID for Leviathan is potentially by year-end or early next year. I know you haven't actually done that yet, but can you talk to the financing strategy there? How quickly you would expect, and how significantly we should expect the capital budget to go up as you prepare for that growth? And then, the interest level in outspending cash flow.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think, when you think about Leviathan, we've always talked about that as probably, majority of the investment will occur over three years, with probably the larger portion of it in the second year and third year, while the first portion is probably less than a third of the total capital. The other nice part about that is essentially, really prefunded that first year with the sell-down of the interest we've sold down this year in the Eastern Med. So, we're in good shape there from the standpoint of being able to fund Leviathan and not take away from any of our other development.
What was the other part of your question, Brian?
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
I guess, the extent to which you'd outspend cash flow, or we would see that versus project financing or financing Leviathan through additional asset sales, including Leviathan itself.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think it's a good point because what we've also said is, I would think high likelihood, almost an expectation of before Leviathan comes on production, we'll have sold down the other 7% or 8% of Tamar. Chance we could sell down some interest in Leviathan also. We've always said that we'd be open to that for the right price, especially post sanction. So, I think you got a number of ways to make sure that you've got that funded, along with the fact that we're still looking at some project financing. And I would expect that will still be an element of things.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Thanks. And then going back to the onshore, obviously, a lot of specifics you're planning for a couple of weeks from now. But just in more strategically, how do you think about what the constraint is to how aggressively you push the envelope onshore U.S.? Is it a cash flow constraint? Is it a leverage target for the company overall? Is it you want increased activity to the point at which operational efficiency would be sacrificed to something else? As we think about modeling this out, what should we think of as the constraint to where you push the envelope?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, I think we'll give you a much better clear picture of that, so we can guide you to what that activity level will be. But I think when you think about the considerations, all of those are considerations. I think you have to look at cash generation or cash uses and cash generation. So, you're going to look at the whole mix of that piece. Some of the things we've done this year already help with setting up the activity for next year, like NBLX being out there, some of those types of things. So, that'll be a good supporter of activity going forward.
I think the other elements you mentioned, how you look at your balance sheet. The key element also is just how do you efficiently and effectively drive the growth activity? And that's something that you want to make sure you're doing it efficiently, so you're creating value as you go. And you're creating the most value you can in optimizing the asset base as you go.
So, all of those things are going to be considerations. I think the execution is going to be key to all of that. And I think if you look at the history of Noble, it's always been strong on execution and that will continue to be the key attribute going forward. Supplement it with the fact that we've maintained the strong balance sheet to support that execution. So, those are the two key elements, both the financial strength and the operational execution, that will help support the plan that we lay out for you.
Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you.

We'll go next to Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning, Dave, and to the rest of your team there. If I could ask one more question about the Marcellus. As I look at your map and you have what, 363,000 net acres now. Can you give us an idea of what percentage of that is HBP and if the natural gas strip bears out the way it looks right now, we're looking at $3 for the next few years. What do you imagine that acreage position will be two years, three years down the line?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, I think the nice part about it is that it's almost all HBP. So, you have the flexibility, which, I think, the heart of your question is, you have the flexibility to develop it and maintain the position that gives you that optionality going forward, Charles. So, I don't think you lose anything or are forced to have to drill something that you're not ready to drill.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Right. Yeah. That's what I was after. You got long-dated option there.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. That's right. You're knocking me (31:57) into this. It's nice part about this, splitting up for both companies is, you do control your development plan. It's not controlling you.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Right. Got it. And then if I could ask another question about the Delaware Basin. I think you guys made it clear in your prepared comments that you're on your front-foot there. You've accelerated and you're getting ready to accelerate more, and I understand that we're going to get more detail on that in a couple weeks.
But I wondered if you could characterize just this last data point you got with, we had this really encouraging well result with high well rate with the big frac you put on it. Are you more in the phase of figuring out what your completion is going to be and honing-in on what your (32:46) design is going to be or is it, in contrast, is this more of a kind of a opening people's eyes and increasing the possibilities of what we may be looking at going forward?
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Charles, this is Gary. I think it's a little bit of both. I think we're certainly still in the phase of optimizing completions in the area, figuring out what the right proppant concentration is as we complete these wells. This is really the fourth well that we brought on as Noble Energy. And we completed this when we were 2,500 pounds of proppant. Third well, we were 3,000 pounds of proppant. We said at the time, we continue to test different ranges. That's what we're continuing to do.
We've got another five or so wells, six wells coming on in the fourth quarter. Those will be different proppant levels as well. Testing all the way up to 5,000 pounds per foot. So, we'll see those results here in another three months or so. So, we're very much still optimizing what the right completion strategy is for these wells.
I think to the second part of your question, it does pretty clearly, I think, demonstrate the quality of the acreage and the potential that's there as we continue to develop the most efficient strategy for playing this out. As we noted in the prepared comments, according to a third-party report that's out there, this well is the second best well in the basin in the third quarter. So, still a lot to do. Still a lot of improvement, I think, we can get beyond this, but hard to be disappointed in what we've seen so far. That's for sure.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
It's helpful detail. Thank you, Gary.

Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Hey, Doug.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Dave, I wonder if I could follow up on a couple of those. On the Marcellus, could you characterize how your standalone outlook contrasts, perhaps, with the joint decision process? And what I'm really getting at is that you've got a lot of ducts I assume do compete for capital in an asset that may otherwise decline. So, what's your objective there, and not digging into too much hopefully on the call in two weeks? Is it to stabilize production or to just characterize how you think about the outlook there?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, I think as we've mentioned, Doug, that now we can kind of control that pace of development. I think we've got in our portion that we're now operating in and control 100%, I think we got 20 or a little over 20 ducts in that, all high quality that will continue to play into our plan going forward. And then, the pace of development on the different pads, if you will, or the different areas will be driven by how it competes for capital. So, we're not changing how we compete for capital on the best returns are going to play, and that's going to be where we're going to allocate our money. And I think you'll continue to see that.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I guess what I'm getting at, it's almost a sizable portion of your overall company production. So, the decline rate could be a bit of a headwind. So I'm trying to understand if you're objective is to start out by stabilizing production and go from there. Or is that not really the way you think about it?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, I don't think we're thinking about it from that particular area, we're thinking about it from how we want to manage the whole company. Again, and that's the benefit of having the portfolio. So, I think as we'll lay out for you and especially as we focus on the whole onshore portfolio here in a couple weeks, I think it ought to be pretty clear on where we're putting our money and what the impact should be in each area.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. My follow-up, hopefully it's an easy one. And again, I'm not sure how much detail you want to go into it today, but four weeks we rise (36:41) the production versus 23 drilled with a very different average lateral lengths in those two buckets. Should we think of the 23 wells, the 9,000-foot cross pipe average, is that going to be the dominant length for those incremental wells going forward? Or are we still going to see a mix you think? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Doug, I'm not sure I heard the very last part of the question, but as far as lateral length, there's pretty big disparity between what we drilled in 3Q at over 9,000-feet and what we brought online at around 6,000-feet. Now part of that is where the activity has been focused. A large part of the wells we brought on in 3Q were in East Pony, which tend to be a little shorter lateral length. Most of what we drilled in 3Q was in Wells Ranch, which tends to be longer lateral length.
I think when you think about going forward in Wells Ranch, we'll continue to see those long laterals. As we move into areas in Mustang in the coming years, you'll see long laterals there as well. Certainly, our preference is to continue to drill those long laterals everywhere we can, plus or minus 9,000-feet. So, that's the way I think about it in the areas that we're active in.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
So, East Pony will still be the shorter lateral, I guess, is what you're saying.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
East Pony still tends to be shorter laterals. There're some offsetting acreage there. It's not quite as contiguous and locked up as Wells Ranch and Mustang is.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Appreciate the answers, guys. Thanks.

We'll go next to David Tameron with Wells Fargo.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Good morning. Just to stick with the DJ, obviously some big wells on the additional proppant. Can you talk about Mustang and kind of what you're seeing in those areas similar to the ones outside of where you stepped out a little bit versus East Pony and Wells Ranch?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah, David. When we brought on our first Mustang IDP wells earlier in the year, we talked about that in the past. Extremely excited about the performance of those wells. This is down in the southern half of what we consider the Mustang IDP. So, it's pretty good step-out from where we've been most active over the last couple of years in the Wells Ranch and East Pony.
Very pleased with the results that we've seen. Again, it's an area where we can drill long laterals. We're just now starting to build out the infrastructure for that area. So we'll able to take advantage of the efficiencies and the cost reductions from that when that's constructed, just like we have in Wells Ranch and East Pony, but very excited about the results. EURs have been well above the type curve projections. And that's an area that, as we get infrastructure built out over the next year or so, you'll see more activity in that area.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And obviously, judging by your comments, those wells are holding up and you haven't seen any difference three months to six months out at some of those earlier wells?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say we continue to be very, very pleased with the results and you'll see more of that here in a couple of weeks on the call.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Just one more. Overall for the corporate â I don't know, Dave, if this is for you or whoever wants to take it â but overall for corporate, how should we think about maintenance CapEx today as compared to three months, six months ago, or a couple years ago?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think we continue to get more efficient on some of this. We've got the development of Leviathan. We would expect it'll be a significant element next year too. So, I think, if you can, David, I'd hold that as we can break out and break out the different elements of capital and impacts in a couple weeks, and I think we can address that then.
David R. Tameron - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.

We'll go next to Pearce Hammond with Simmons Piper Jaffray.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray
Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. My first question pertains to service costs and what you're seeing on that front. Are you seeing any inflation right now in the basins you operate in? And then, as you look out to 2017, how are you planning around that? And are you doing anything to try to help mitigate any type of inflation? Thank you.
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Hey, Pearce. This is Gary. I mean, we're starting to see a little bit of cost creep in some areas. Steel prices have gone up. Rig costs are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Those are probably the areas we've seen the most in so far. I wouldn't say it's anything significant yet.
And, as we've talked about in the past, well over 50% of the cost savings and capital efficiencies that we've been able to deliver over the last couple of years, we expect to stick with us even after prices come up and some of the service costs come back up. So, not anything to be too concerned about yet. We've got a supply chain group here that stays very much on top of where everything has headed. We've got great relationships with our key partners and suppliers, and continue to work that every chance we get.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray
Excellent. And then my follow-up is just high level, what are the next steps on Leviathan to reach FID by the time you want it, by later this year?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Right. Well, I think, it's getting a little more line of sight and some more progress on some of contracts, especially some of the domestic portion. We now have 400 million to 450 million a day, with the addition of Jordan and what we've done already domestically. We've got some things we think we can pull together over the next short period of time, getting some of the additional permits in place, some of the agreements, whether it's between governments, within the government on some of the key elements of those, lining up some of the financing, making progress on that, finalizing our bids coming in on some of the key technical aspects and just pulling those together. So, I think everything's all on track. Great progress. I don't see anything that's giving me any concern at this point.
Pearce Hammond - Simmons Piper Jaffray
Great. Thank you very much.

Well go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe if I could just follow up with a couple production-related questions. First, in Israel, can you help us understand how much â I mean, if you look over the course of the strong production that you've had this year, how much of that has been driven by seasonality and weather, and how much do you think is a result of structural improvements in Israeli demand that should be recurring going forward?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. I'll let Keith talk a little bit about that, but there's still seasonality. You see that as you move from third quarter to fourth quarter with Israel, that you got the expected seasonality. But demand's been strong, and let me have Keith kind of accentuate that a little bit.
J. Keith Elliott - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah, Ryan. I think what you see in Israel is, we've really seen the impact of the government's decree of the sort of 15% year-on-year coal reduction from 2015 to 2016. So, that's had a meaningful impact, as Dave said, still seeing the seasonality that comes in. But that seasonality, I would say, has probably been less of an issue this year, as we've seen. Typically, we see much more of a kind of dip in the shoulder months of spring and autumn, and we're not seeing as big a dips as we would historically expect.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then maybe on the Gulf of Mexico, and maybe this will come in a couple weeks, but any insight on how do you expect volumes to track, in particular from the three most recent developments there, Gunflint, Big Bend, and Dantzler over the next, I guess, as we look through 2017, over the next 15 months or so? And then any commentary on kind of decline rates overall for that part of your business?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I mean, and you're right, we'll show you more, but I mean just in general, I think things are going as expected. You've seen Big Bend and Dantzler now on for a year. So, we would expect those to start to decline. And Gunflint, we'll have the advantage of a full year next year for Gunflint. And it's been doing as expected, at least as well as expected.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
But should we expect moderate declines out of the Gulf of Mexico next year, year-on-year?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
We'll lay that out. We'll lay out the plan on what we should see on each portion of the business. So, it'll be helpful and give you some more transparency.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

We'll go next to Gail Nicholson with KLR Group.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Good morning. Looking at the location of the Johnny Ringo, that seems to be closer to the Calamity Jane well that had a lower oil cut. Could you talk about maybe the higher oil cut in Johnny Ringo that was driven by the completion technique, or potentially where you landed in the zone?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah, Gail. I think it's more of the location of the well where we are in the zone. The Calamity Jane well on the far northeast side of the acreage, I think we got the toe section of that lateral into an area that tends to be a bit gassier, which is why you saw a little bit lower oil cut there. I think the oil cut that we've seen on the Johnny Ringo is probably more representative of what you should expect to see in the eastern half of that acreage.
Gail Nicholson - KLR Group LLC
Okay, great. And then looking at the updated 4Q volume guidance that you provided, the outperformance in the DJ, is that assuming a 1,600-pound per proppant foot loading? Or you talked about those 2,000 pounds that you did, or is that higher expectation of proppant loading in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter proppant loading?
Gary W. Willingham - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, our proppant loading has been creeping up as we've talked about. I think we've been pretty conservative in the past about assuming the uplift that we would see on production from those higher loadings until we saw more history. I think the ability that we have in the fourth quarter now to offset the 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that we're losing as part of the Marcellus trade with higher volumes in the DJ and GOM, you're seeing some of that performance start to show up. So, I think the way we've got it modeled for 4Q is representative of what we're bringing on in 4Q. We'll see how those higher concentration jobs perform over time, and we'll see where we go from there.

We'll go next to Tim Rezvan with Mizuho Securities.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my call. First question, in prepared comments I wanted to make sure I got the numbers right. There was discussion of $850 million of the term loan was paid down and you expect liquidity of over $5 billion at year-end. Are there any other moving parts in that kind of equation or is that assuming you'll be free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter?
Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.
This is Ken. We'll be free cash flow positive in the quarter, and we also expect to receive some proceeds for the sell-down of the 3% interest in Tamar. So, you'll have a very robust quarter, and we'll end the year in very strong position in terms of liquidity.
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
And then there's the $200 million as we close the CONSOL and Marcellus agreement that we'll be paying out there too. So, those would probably be the moving pieces to think about.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Okay. And then, the timing of the possible 1% incremental sell-down, is there clarity on when that would be?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Well, their decision is by closing. So that's probably something we'll know more of over the next month. We would still expect closing probably over the next month or so of the initial 3%. And so, they have to decide by closing.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And my follow-up question is more of a modeling one. Does 4Q 2016 NGL guidance you provided, if we take the mid-point, you're down about 9% quarter-over-quarter. Is that entirely from the Marcellus JV or are there kind of other factors driving that?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
Yeah. I think, obviously, there's some impact from the Marcellus portion there. It could be just a mix of what we're bringing on in the Eagle Ford from that balance too. I think as we've seen in the DJ, it's actually a little higher oil cut in some of the other areas. And follow up with Brad, he can probably give you as more insight into the specifics.
Timothy Rezvan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

We go next to Mike Scialla with Stifel.
Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Last quarter, the BOEM issued a notice to the Gulf of Mexico operators about posting supplemental surety bonds or other collateral, I guess, to ensure you have 100% of the future decommissioning costs covered. Wanted to see if there's any impact to Noble based on that? And does that change the landscape for the Gulf of Mexico for the industry in general at all?
Kenneth M. Fisher - Noble Energy, Inc.
This is Ken. I think we've been granted some decent amount of selfish insurance under the program. So, that's the primary waivable cover. Secondly then, we would have access to surety bonds for any additional piece of that. So, I don't see it having any real impact on us. I think the other thing that's beneficial is, is that your partners will also be posting collateral if they're less credit worthy. So, I think that's actually in a way a good thing. So, I don't see it having an impact on the way we think about that business.
Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Ken. And I wanted to see the plans for the rig you have drilling at Tamar right now, is that rig under long-term contract? Or what are you going to do with that rig going forward?
David L. Stover - Noble Energy, Inc.
The contract on that rolls off, I think, towards the summer of next year. So, we haven't defined exactly what we're doing after Tamar. We're in discussions on a number of different things there after this Tamar-8 well that we're drilling. But, I mean, that well will go through probably with drilling completion into probably late first quarter or so.
Michael Scialla - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. Thank you.
