Welcome to the Markit First Quarter 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Sylvia and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Matthew Kolby. Mr. Kolby you may begin.
Matthew Kolby
Thank you, Sylvia. Welcome to Markit's earnings conference call to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2016. With me today in London is Lance Uggla, Founder and Chief Executive Officer and Jeff Gooch, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, Lance will begin by walking through some key highlights during the quarter and also provide a few comments on the proposed merger and then Jeff will cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open up the call for Q&A. As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the IR section of the Markit website. Press release and supporting documents can also be found on our website. Additionally this morning we filed with the SEC a proxy on Form F4 related to the proposed merger with IHS. This can also be found on the IR section of the website.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call may include certain forward looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed by our comments today. Information about the factors that can affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings including our annual report on Form 20F. This call may also include certain forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures, a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures is not available without a reasonable effort.
Now I will turn it over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Thanks, Matt. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. This is the first call since we announced the proposed merger of Equals with IHS. We have had a lot of interest in Markit from new investors and analysts in the past few weeks and I want to welcome you to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I will make a few comments regarding the proposed merger shortly, but first, I want to discuss our financial performance this quarter and provide a few examples of how we're executing on our growth strategy in the current operating environment. Let's start with the quarter.
On our last earnings call we stated that Q1 would be challenging not only because of a tough comparison quarter in the prior year, but also due to the overall macroeconomic environment impacting sales cycles in some of our businesses. Despite this, first quarter revenues grew 7.8% on a constant currency basis with organic growth of 1% and acquired growth of 6.8%. As I mentioned last quarter organic revenue growth is lower than where we would like it to be, however, we expect stronger growth through the remaining quarters of this year. Let's look at the divisional performance for the quarter. Information continued its solid performance with 5% organic growth. Processing was largely in line with our expectations, excluding the impact of $5 million in price reductions, growth was broadly flat year on year and we remain vigilant on costs allowing us to maintain processing margins above 50%.
And finally, Solutions had a challenging quarter as we had anticipated with 4% organic growth. However, we expect Solutions organic revenue growth to improve to a high single-digit to low double digit level in the second quarter. Now let's talk about how we're executing on our long term growth strategy. For those who are new to the Markit story, especially IHS analysts and investors, let me provide some background. Markit's success has been fueled by five key drivers. Increasing our customer penetration and expanding our global customer footprint, delivering products and services that drive customer cost efficiency, introducing innovative product offerings and enhancements, capitalizing on the evolving regulatory environment and finally, pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships. During the quarter, we saw many examples of these drivers in play across our businesses and I would like to highlight a few of them for you today.
Let's start with customer penetration. One example is how we're working with our buy side customers who are looking for a trusted partner to help them respond to the ongoing changes in the financial services industry. One product that has consistently seen significant demand is our Enterprise Data Management software which achieved another quarter of double digit organic growth. We're pleased to announce this quarter that two established asset managers, Thornburg Investment Management and Westwood Management, both selected our EDM software to maintain regulatory compliance and effectively manage store and distribute data across their firms. So while we have successfully grown EDM from 50 customers when we acquired this business, to over 150 today, the addressable market for this product remains large and growing and with our broad product offering, we're well positioned to further penetrate the buy side and drive future growth, including growth driven by our proposed merger with IHS.
Moving on to how we're helping customers rationalize costs and operate more efficiently. Our KYC managed service achieved a number of significant milestones this quarter. First, we extended coverage to Hong Kong and Singapore to help reduce cross-border complexity for our customers operating in the region. This is a significant step in building out the service as we increase our global footprint. And second, we're extremely excited to announce that Pimco, one of the world's largest buy side institutions and a long-standing customer of Markit has selected our KYC service and tax utility to meet its due diligence and on boarding requirements, expanding its use of our regulatory and compliance ecosystem.
This is a significant development for our KYC.com and tax utility platforms and coupled with the opportunity to offer it to the 50,000 corporate customers from IHS positions us well versus the competition. On to Innovation. Markit has always been driven by our ability to innovate and enhance our product offerings in collaboration with the industry. In March we partnered with the industry to conduct the first large-scale block chain test in the CDS market alongside four of the largest global banks, DTCC and Axoni, a blockchain infrastructure provider. Markit generated smart contracts from CDS trade confirmations creating a distributed global record. The test proved in a real world trade environment that part of the process of a CDS trade could be accomplished by using blockchain technology.
The proof of concept demonstrates how we continue to leverage new technologies to help customers cut operational costs, minimize balance sheet restrictions and promote capital flow. We will continue to be an active participant in these industry initiatives. Now let's talk about regulation. Markit remains a key provider of solutions to help customers adapt to the evolving environment. In this quarter, we have been actively working on two European regulations, MiFID II and FRTB where the industry is looking to Markit for solutions to meet best execution and reporting requirements. And finally strategic acquisitions and partnerships which are central to the Markit growth story. In addition to our merger with IHS which I will come to in a moment, this quarter we announced a small deal with Fitch to take over their CDS pricing service which will extend our leadership position in the credit markets. 
As you know, Markit's premerger long-term financial objective for organic revenue growth is 5% to 7%. This has not changed. However, looking forward, our long-term financial objectives will include IHS and as a combined company we expect mid-single-digit organic growth with significant opportunity to accelerate. Let's talk a bit more about the exciting merger with IHS. We have a strong strategic fit and together will be a leading provider of critical information, analytics and solutions to a global customer base of over 50,000, including more than 75% of the Fortune Global 500. The demand for unique content across energy, financial services and transportation continues to grow. And by combining complementary data sets and products while leveraging technology to meet the needs of our customers, we will expand our addressable markets globally.
From a financial standpoint, we see meaningful and achievable costs in revenue synergies and the free cash flow generated by the combined company will support a capital allocation framework to drive long term shareholder value. We have been working closely with and Jerry and his team on integration plans and expect to announce the management team and board closer to closing. Many of you will have seen we filed our merger proxy this morning and we continue to expect closing to take place in the second half of 2016. In the meantime, it is business as usual here at Markit.
To conclude, I am really excited for 2016. We have a fantastic opportunity set in front of us and look forward to closing the merger with IHS and getting started on the integration. In the meantime, we remain focused on achieving our goals and will continue to deliver results for our shareholders. I will now hand over to Jeff who will take you through the numbers in more detail.
Jeff Gooch
Thanks, Lance and good morning everyone. I will now walk you through a summary of our first quarter results starting on slide seven. Reported revenue grew 6% to $288 million and was up 7.8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $124 million with an EBITDA margin of 43.3%. As we said previously, we typically see lower margins in Q1 compared to the fourth quarter as you absorb higher compensation expenses related to annual pay increases and bonuses. Adjusted earnings were $64 million, a reduction of $4.2 million compared to last year. However, high interest expense following the private placement offering in Q4 impacted earnings by approximately $5 million. Looking ahead to Q2, we would expect interest expense to remain inline with the $8.3 million charge we saw this quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.35. You should note that the recent increase in share price have a negligible impact on the weighted average diluted share count to Q1. However, if the share price holds at these levels, we would expect the Q2 diluted share count to be at least 194.7 million shares, plus a further increase from options exercised during the quarter. As usual, we show the sensitivity of share count to varying share prices in the appendix in the pack. On slide eight organic revenue growth was 1% for the quarter which is primarily driven by large software revenue recognition compared to last year and the price changes we implemented in processing in Q2 2015. The 2015 acquisitions of Information Mosaic, DealHub and CoreOne delivered a combined 6.8% to revenue growth for the quarter. 
Lastly, FX movements adversely affected the quarter reducing revenue growth by 1.8% due to a strengthened U.S. dollar against the Sterling and the Euro. As you can see on slide nine, we continue to maintain total recurring revenues above 90%. Recurring fixed revenues for the quarter grew to 58.1% and 53.5% last year, due to new business wins and information solutions and our recent acquisitions. The new rates for Q1 were above 90% inline with prior quarters. Recurring variable revenues were down year-over-year due to a decline in processing revenue. I will now turn to slide 10 to discuss operating expenses. Q1 operating expenses increased 9.3% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by acquisitions and new hires. Exceptional costs incurred in the quarter included $8.7 million of merger related costs.
Lastly, many of you saw that we agreed with the European Commission on a set of proposed commitments that they have adopted to resolve their investigation into the credit default swap market. This was without any finding of wrongdoing or monetary liability on our part. Given DHO the investigation is an active, we don't expect any further significant legal costs related to these investigations in future quarters. You may see a small charge for legal fees to finalize the European Commission case once their market testing is complete. Now let's move on to talking about our operating segments in more detail. Information organic revenue growth was 4.9% largely driven by strong growth across our pricing and reference data and indices businesses. Within fixed income pricing and reference data loan pricing delivered another strong quarter growing almost 20% year over year.
In addition, loan pricing grew high single digits as we continue to expand third-party redistribution relationships to broaden our customer reach. Indices recorded double digit organic growth again this quarter. This was largely driven by a bond indices which benefited from strong inflows into iBoxx based ETF ending the quarter with $103 billion in assets under management. Also the franchise grew over 25% driven by new forms agreements and increased data sales to buy side customers. CoreOne which contributed 4.1% of revenue growth had positive momentum in terms of new sales this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin showed a small increase to 48.8% for the quarter.
Now I turn to processing slide 12. Organic revenue declined 9.6% driven by lower revenue in both derivatives and loan processing. However, excluding the price discounts started a year ago organic revenue was down only 2%. In derivatives processing we saw slightly lower volumes as the industry experienced a challenging quarter overall. In loan processing secondary volumes were maintained, however, primary volumes declined to their lowest levels in the last eight quarters. The market for new loan issuance remains challenging, although April did show a more encouraging trend. DealHub contributed 4.6% of acquired growth and we're pleased with the progress we're making in integrating this asset.
Finally, as Lance mentioned margins were 50.9% in the quarter, inline with our stated objective of approximately 50%. Cost savings in processing continue to be a focus for 2016. Looking forward to the second quarter, the 2015 price reductions we implemented last year will be fully cycled through, however, I want to remind you that in Q2 2015 we saw very high interest rate derivative volumes and primary loan issuance which offset these price changes. Let's move onto Solutions on slide 13. Organic revenue growth in Solutions was 4% of the quarter reflecting the impact we discussed in our last earnings conference call. The lower organic revenue growth for the quarter is due to two main factors.
First, we realized lower non-recurring software license revenue from compared to last year particularly in our indices business and second, loan assets under management WSO services showed modest growth compared to higher growth rates a year ago. On the positive side, while sales cycles have increased for banks in particular, we saw new business wins across enterprise software and managed services. EDM recorded double digit organic growth in the quarter as a result of new license deals and we also saw double digit growth in corporate actions and counterparty manager. (inaudible) which we're rebranding as Markit Digital continue to show high single digit revenue growth with add ons from existing customers and continuing demand amongst banking and financial media customers. Acquisitions contributed 12.5% of revenue growth in Q1 driven by Information Mosaic in Q1.
Adjusted EBITDA margins in Q1 was 30.6%, a decrease compared to the prior year primarily reflects the timing of non-recurring software revenue recognition I mentioned earlier and increasing investment in our new initiatives. Looking ahead to Q2, we anticipate recognizing revenue on several large software licenses so we expect to achieve significantly higher organic growth rates. We remain comfortable with our solutions guidance of 10% to 15% organic revenue growth over the long term. Finally, turning to slide 14. Leverage was down to 1.31 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of March, reflecting good underlying cash flows even after paying out bonuses in the quarter.
This by our growth, management continued to exercise control of Capex with this quarter consistent with last year's spend of $40 million. In light of the proposed merger I would like to reiterate that we have suspended both accelerated share repurchase gain and the previously announced $500 million board authorization share buyback program. Additionally, acquisition activity will be limited going forward. As Lance mentioned we filed the proxy for proposed IHS merger this morning. I want to reiterate that post-merger we will focus our combined free cash flows on buying back stock in both 2017 and 2018. I would also like to bring your attention to a few items in the proxy. First, you will see we did a pro forma conversion of our 2015 IFRS accounts to U.S. GAAP and applied normal acquisition accounting rules. This resulted in no impact to reported revenues.
The change of capitalization of external used software resulted in a $16.2 million impact to adjusted EBITDA but only a $4.2 million impact to adjusted earnings given the associated depreciation was also removed. Another consequence of the acquisition accounting is that we will need to show a higher stock based compensation charge as we fair value our stock awards upon closing. This is a non-cash expense and does not reflect any actual change in the date impact of those games. Overall, despite a somewhat disappointing quarter for revenue growth, I am pleased we have been able to mitigate the impact on EBITDA and earnings. Management remains fully focus on closing key customer deals into the gray and manage our costs as we move forward through 2016. We look forward to completing the merger with IHS and remain well-positioned to deliver on our long-term financial objectives.
With that I will now hand the call back over to Matt.
Matthew Kolby
Thanks, Jeff. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would like to now open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik
Maybe if I can just touch on the Solutions business again. Can you just help us understand the different moving pieces here how we should continue to think about it may be in the next year and then longer term?
Lance Uggla
So despite the quarter being challenging, our long-term objectives for Solutions organic growth hasn't changed. So the 10% to 15% that we talk about is unchanged. In Q2, we do expect the organic growth to improve to high single digits to low double digits. So a bit of timing and challenges in the quarter. If you look at EDM market counterparty manager, corporate actions, those were all double digit growers. If you look at Markit digital or Markit on Demand, as you knew, it's continued its steady high single digit growth. So I feel very good about the pipeline, the forward look and would reiterate the guidance that -- or the long term objective that we have given you before.
Manav Patnaik
So even the high single digit growth in Q2 obviously still below the range, so is it just one or two products that is delaying the process I guess I'm just trying to better understand the deceleration we have seen over the last two quarters.
Lance Uggla
Yes, I think the high single to low double digits is a small hedge to the 10% to 15%. That's fair, you are right. And I think that should be expected given the Q1 result for us to be cautious as we look forward, but at the same time, I think the strength in my statement to you about our forward long term objective is there and we've got one or two products that have been a little slower to take off. I think -- but I reiterated in the call the key milestones in KYC for example where I am seeing very strong success factors coming through and we haven't turned those into revenue yet.
We've also seen a bit longer sales cycles and thatâs something that remains a challenge in the current operating environment, but we saw a record quarter for new sales booked in the quarter. So I think that's a positive across the group. We've got strong pipeline. If it takes a bit longer to close, that gives us reason to give a slight hedge, but I'm very confident with our long term objective on solutions of being 10% to 15% and I hope that we tuck back into that in the second quarter.
Manav Patnaik
And then just one more for me, I guess in your filings today there's a bunch of I guess forecast you assumed is part of the merger and even for 2016 they imply a good uptick towards the end of the year. I guess, should we be reading that as guidance why do you see that uptick through the rest of the year any color around that?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, Manava, it's important to make clear that I mean those projections we prepared for our board presented at the beginning of December last year. So kind of reflected thinking probably September, October time of the management team. And whether prepared for external communication or for the merger with IHS, but that was the basis for legal reasons we needed to use for the merger discussions because that was the board approved plan. So I think that probably is a reflective of current thinking and you saw a number of stress in our areas which we ran with you at the end of the process in terms of scenario two and scenario three.
Operator
And your next question comes from Warren Gardiner from Evercore.
Warren Gardiner
Just kind of the solutions growth of 10% to 15% forecast, maybe just to pick a part a little bit more in terms of what do you guys kind of embedding in terms of loan growth with respect to WSO as you kind of think about that range?
Lance Uggla
I think as I mentioned in my comments, we have seen very large asset management growth with WSO product. It's a Q1 we were low single digits growth which has been lows for a long period of time, so we anticipate that and continue to grow. Where they donât they grow much more slowly that causes two problems first one is obviously lower growth [indiscernible] but also we charge setup fees as we bring new assets on to the platform, so set up for Q1 was considerably lower than they were year ago when we were posting 17%, 18% growth. So we will see those two problems I think at the moment given the primary markets last April little bit better they are very volatile month-to-month so I don't even think it's a big bounce back is going to happen through course of this year. but imagine we would see slow primary markets and lower AUM growth in terms of loans.
Warren Gardiner
And then I guess on the pricing and reference data side, another very strong quarter seems like fixed income was a big driver there 20% growth. Is that more market share gains or is it more just new users and if it is the new users, what kind of channels is that coming from, just more color on what's driving that either by asset class or user base it would be really helpful. Thanks.
Lance Uggla
So that was real market share gains for us. We have invested in our solutions over the past few years. They are very technology driven and we have seen consistent quarter over quarter gains due to market share. Not because there's a lot more participants in the marketplace, but we were able to offer a very compelling solution at the right price.
Warren Gardiner
Okay. And is that across just the fixed income space completely or is it focus within a particular asset class like anything munis or anything like that or?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, so if you look at the numbers for bond pricing which is corporate bonds, munis we saw around 20% growth, as Lance say we take market share from other providers and backup stages of the new account counts as well. If you look at the other fixed income, product loan showed high single digit growth. They are primarily driven by redistribution arrangements with additional partners there. TVS [ph] was pretty flat we should 1% quarter for the quarter so that quarter was more stable this quarter.
Operator
Our following question comes from Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank.
Ato Garrett
Just a quick question on your expectation for improving organic growth for the year is that primarily going to be driven from the recovery you mentioned for your higher expectation you've mentioned from solutions or are there some other factors there as well?
Jeff Gooch
Two things to think about, one as Lance mentioned, we do expect Solutions growth to bounce back. We were very light on software recognition in Q1, we wouldnât expect -- quite signed a bunch of those recognition agreements to happen in Q2 and on the processing side, whilst Q2 I think it's still going to be a challenge compared to quarter, by Q3 and Q4 we don't have the price increase price change in the comparative and we had more stress primary loan and volume quarters as well to compare do so those comparatives would be much easier second half of the year.
Ato Garrett
Okay and then go into processing you mentioned that loan primary issuance was down, thinking about why that was down year-over-year, is that more due to a spike in activity in the first quarter last year, creating a tougher comp or is that just lower activity overall?
Jeff Gooch
Sadly just lower activity, I think a year ago I think Q1 last year was very low. It was even lower still this time so the Q1 was exceptionally low from a primary's perspective.
Operator
Following question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alex Kramm
Just coming back to Solutions for a minute. Sorry if I missed this, but can you actually talk about the magnitude of some of those one off sales and how much of a drag that was this quarter and then maybe give us a flavor of how volatile those software sales can be on a quarterly basis, how much they usually account for and what we should be expecting around those particular for the remainder of the year?
Jeff Gooch
I think there's a whole variety of different products in our software space but the analytics one which I called in my comments some of those contracted $2 million to $3 million. So having a $3 million contract last year and not having one this year has had an enormous impact of year-over-year growth rate for the whole Solutions division, we typically do four, five a year, so you can get [indiscernible] makes this fantastic call. So we have a couple of those looking to get recognition certainly one would do a [indiscernible] recognition of this quarter coming up. On the other parts of the business, the numbers are much smaller but you can certainly get interim payments of $300,000 to $500,000 is not common.
Alex Kramm
And then maybe more holistically coming starting around the deal, with IHS, when we talked to some of your clients and financial services which so far has been your core customer base, I think so far there's been a little bit more of a head scratcher like what is this going to do for us. So maybe just from bigger picture perspective, what's been the feedback from your customer base and to what degree have you kind of cleared up the bigger picture of this deal?
Lance Uggla
Right. Well I think I would start if you believe we're in the information age, content is the basis for what we need to serve up to our customers and we've got to deliver it to them using technology and deliver it with our software in the right way. I think the revenue opportunity together with IHS and Markit is one of really three pieces. The first is, taking existing unique content, so content that is unique to IHS and the customers they serve and bringing that into our data and specifically our index franchise and there we see about I think as we forecast $100 million of what we call low hanging fruit for IHS market, about $20 million of that makes them up that content being beverage into an index franchise that's growing at double digits and that's really exciting and it's not just creating new indices it's factors, it's benchmarks, it's indices, it's index overlay, it's a whole bunch of exciting opportunities and some of those are around overlays of economic and political risk, they could be leveraging the maritime data, of IHS, it can be looking into the energy and transportation sectors and looking for unique content that has value to a fixed income or equity participant in the financial markets.
So I think that's a very easy $20 million to achieve over the next three years and I see that as just give that a tick. When you look at the other, the next bit, which is two components of $40 million each. The first component caring on with the IHS being is taking existing IHS products that have been built to compete in the marketplace and sold to financial market participants with a very small sales team. Now leveraging a global financial market footprint, that's about $40 million. That's taking IHS Vantage, [indiscernible] other developed products IHS Connect and delivering that to our customers to use to do their business.
And in fact, financial market participants if you just take the private equity sector for an example, our building up funds to be invested into the energy markets and for them having tools and services to help make those decisions is very important. So this is built products, nothing needs to get built, but leveraging several hundred sales people and account managers rather than the existing 25 by themselves, very exciting.
The next piece of that is all the economic and political risk side of IHS where they are building country ratings and economic ratings globally and leveraging that with our economic PMI franchise that feels very, very exciting and the teams are extremely excited to be working together soon. The final $40 million it's not that 60 of a 100, the final 40 million is market services accelerated into the IHS clients set. You have to remember, we have about 4000 financial market as customers, they have 50,000 corporates and 120 major government relationships. Those are very complementary. You don't if you think about you try to think about a financial markets company and energy or transportation company, you can get easily confused. But if you think about it from the basis of information and content, these are unique customer sets that all need to consume content and the type of content that we have is highly leveragable into each other's client base.
So if you just take KYC for example, KYC needs to be implemented with all the major corporates that are customers of the banks. And the key corporate relationships that IHS are ones that we need to implement our KYC solution with. They are the same companies that we need to implement our tax utility with and although that might sound challenging to you, these are products that market has today. So for example, Tesla, Microsoft, they currently are corporate that use Markit's tax utility. It's a built product, it's ready to go. We love the introductions into 50,000 customers where the benefit is within the group and we see that cross sell as being something that will allow us to achieve that second $40 million on KY3P, KYC tax and Markit digital all very exciting.
So yes, for myself and Jerry included, the first time we met we thought about leveraging a bit of content. It didn't take as many meetings as you will read in the proxy to see that we had a much bigger opportunity together and we grow increasingly excited and our investors as well as our customers are definitely starting to understand. But like anything, things need explaining. And so hopefully that answer helps that out.
Alex Kramm
Just quickly, at the end of last year you talked a lot more about using pricing as maybe something that you haven't focused on as much, can you just talk about any impact youâve seen this quarter if you're doing a little bit more CPI that you're building into your contracts or anything that's helping on the pricing side? Thank you.
Jeff Gooch
Sure. As we mentioned previously started rolling out price increases across a number of our product primarily on the information side. I think we have not raised prices quite a few years, customers are very understanding in that process, it's going very well. To set expectations though it's going to take a number of years to cycle those increases into our products. So I think the 2016 is going to fairly negligible impact in terms of growth rates, but I think as you roll towards '17, '18, '19 that will start to be helpful in terms of growth.
Operator
Following question comes from [indiscernible] from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Unidentified Analyst
You have talked about how the sales cycle for banks has lengthened, did that get worse in the last couple of months or has it been fairly similar?
Jeff Gooch
It is interesting actually because it feels like the environment was tougher at the beginning of this year, but I will show you show now how Lance and I did a brief update on some of this for the board last week. Interestingly and these are audited numbers but if you look at started our sales system it looks like the average sales cycle for a bank increased by about 25% since compared to a year ago, take 25% longer to sell a piece of software in particular. However, if you look at performance it does look like actually the decline was more September, October last year as you would know these things before year-end actually as Lance mentioned Q1 we hit a record sales quarter, doesnât feel like actually things are starting to improve which feels counterintuitive maybe just a unique thing down to our particular customers but it feels like Q4 with [indiscernible] have been improving through Q1. Given software to export to six months to sell [ph] before revenue recognition that's going to take a fair while to impact the numbers.
Unidentified Analyst
And then, turning to margins. Do you think that 2015 should be the trough in consolidated margins? Or given what we've seen in the first quarter, is it reasonable to think that we might see some margin compression into 2016?
Jeff Gooch
I think the pattern overall will depend on the couple of things and going to hedge my [indiscernible]. I think generally the core business is to show margin accretion of the FX and the small impact that produce on that number. It will really come down to our investment profile and the acquired businesses how they pickup, I guess we will be acquiring [indiscernible] acquired businesses usually drag. So I don't think 2016 is going to be an improved margin on 2015 given where we started from but I would think probably broadly similar.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then just last question, any updates on pricing changes in processing in Europe is that still a 2018 event and if it is would you think about making any changes to your pricing earlier?
Jeff Gooch
At the moment the rules they can be implemented from January 2018, that's I don't think happened earlier there's still no indication of phasing and how that might come in later. I think the pricing change we made in the U.S. was particular unique, the [indiscernible] and the customers have not changed there tailend mapping so we just reflected that in the pricing. If there is no steps in Europe we can't make the equivalent change so we will have to wait and see but at the moment I think thatâs the few years off and not something weâre focusing on.
Operator
The next question comes Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan 
Can you talk about your M&A strategy for instance right now are you in a bit of a holding period given the IHS merger or are you still looking at tuck-ins, I know you just did the Fitch CDS pricing acquisition this quarter but just wanted to know your thoughts on that.
Lance Uggla
Yes I think what Jerry and I said when I went out we're going to be very focused in 2017 and into 2018 on integrating the two companies. We will use our capital to acquire stock and drive that 20% EPS growth that we described. I think that means that our focus on M&A very, very limited and things that we're doing like Fitch it's almost more like a contract than it is a M&A, but we will do a little bit of that I am sure IHS will as well, but nothing that would be considered even small to medium-size M&A it just very, very small tuck in strategic contract type deals.
Toni Kaplan
And then, stock comp came in a little bit higher than we were expecting. Were there any onetime items to call out there and how should we think about modeling that going forward?
Jeff Gooch
I think it was about a $12 million impact on the stock on charge because of liabilities for national insurance. Basically underwrite IFRS which you won't have to do on the U.S. GAAP, we have to set up liability in the future employee tax charges so combination of changes in that model the increased share price and other bits and pieces result us putting a $12 million charge. So the underlying charge is about $12 million which I think was relatively stable and is about $12 million one off in terms of those additional NIC liabilities.
Toni Kaplan
Okay and just lastly, I just want to make sure I heard correctly, I think you mentioned that your expecting to recognize some additional revenue on software licenses in the second quarter. Are these already signed? Have you already entered into these contracts or are they just in your pipeline and you're just very confident that you are going to sign them?
Jeff Gooch
In most cases, they are signed and indeed implemented on the client-side. The contracts vary. Sometimes we get paid when it's implemented, sometimes we get final recognition when it's acceptance when it's just on the server, sometimes it has to be live. So vary by contract type, but in all cases I think the agreement is fine where the process is setting up on the client-side which already set up we're just waiting for the system to go live and get final client acceptance. So under revenue recognition it's not around when the deal is signed or when the payment receives, when the client is committed to the contract. So that depends on the details. So we're very confident we will reach recognition in all of those contracts, it's just a question of timing.

Next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Gunter Hanson [ph] for Gary. Just a follow up on the Solutions. Just the Q2 growth outlook for high double-digit low double digit, what are some of the puts and takes is that just some of the licensing recognition that you were just talking about Jeff?
Jeff Gooch
I think if you look to Q1, most of the business performed fairly well, assuming that continues in Q2, I think will be relatively comfortable. So really we're just looking for recognition of some of the software contract that's going to put us into the high single digit range and pretty much straight away and if we can get to low double digit we just need the WSO to see how the business perform slightly better.
Unidentified Analyst
And just in terms of the overall macro challenges or conditions you guys cited, maybe just kind of give us another kind of brief overview of how those turned so far and kind of what your outlook is for the rest of the year?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, if I look overall the health of the three business segments, I think on the information side of things, most of the incremental revenue there comes from by side accounts, you saw we actually showed acceleration of growth in Q1 over Q4 last year. We feel very confident about our business going forward, sales pipeline is very strong, we had great sales quarter to first quarter so that feels in a good place. Processing the underlying markets definitely been a challenge in Q1 but as I said earlier, we will get better comps in the second half of the year Q2 is still going to be tough from a comp perspective but just the reduced, the easier comps are going to make those numbers look stronger for the second half. But obviously, at some point we will get some volume bounce back.
So it's really been around Solutions, most of the businesses are running fine. I think on software side, as we mentioned several times already on this call the last one, sales cycles for software have definitely elongated. Implementation times are now fairly elongated as well but actually if you look at the pipeline size, it's at record levels, banks have to reduce costs, they have to comply with regulations. So there's no let-up in sales activity or interest, certainly through book revenue definitely slowed down a little bit. I think that's fairly inevitable given the climate particularly the European banks at the moment. But the good news is, there is no lack of pipeline so we feel and are very confident about the long-term future but these markets have cycles and we have to accept where we're at the moment.
Lance Uggla
Maybe I can add to that. Because I just finished about seven weeks of client visits from the beginning of the year and the majority of those these trips were on the buy side and the same as what Jeff just described with this need to use managed services and leverage technology to reduce costs from a bank perspective. I have to say, the large asset managers are all interested in data management solutions from third-party providers like ourselves and we have a winning suite there.
They are all interested in transforming themselves digitally. We've got award-winning product to offer there analytics order management and portfolio management, tax, compliance and regulatory implementation. We're just so well positioned that I see the pipeline of both the buy side and sell side growing for those opportunities and it's always disappointing when you don't deliver the double digits like you want, but I have to say, I think we have said clearly on this call we haven't changed our long-term financial objectives because of the confidence we have in our products and the market environment surrounding us and so we will live through the quarter and move forward and we will look forward to getting back in line with our long term objectives.

Next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi 
I was wondering can we get an update on the financial details behind KYC in the indexing business, I'm particularly curious about the contributions to revenue and margin profiles.
Jeff Gooch
Okay two very different businesses there. So do you mean KYC and the general index separately?
Joseph Foresi
Yes.
Jeff Gooch
Okay. So in terms of the index business itself, I think overall that business grew double digits. If you look at the elements of it, it's sort of four elements these days we have CoreOne in there. There's a bond index business which showed very strong growth that's really our iBoxx franchise and ETFs linked to the iBoxx franchise, I think we saw around about 20% growth. That has very good margins.
We have been economic index business which again showed about 25% growth. Primarily because of some of those big subscriptions we signed in the second half of last year which we now have in the Q3 earnings call for memory. So both those businesses have high growth characteristics and very strong margins. We have a derivatives index business which is somewhat flat since established business, EPS [ph] tracks there's not much growth in those markets we're hoping for futurization of those contracts at some point but that this time relatively flat business and then we have a number of index services which in particular recall extended out. So those are at the moment is somewhat low margins we're expanding up but flatly running the business is doing a great job bringing the two platforms together driving costs out and we certainly are got much stronger pipeline there.
But I think at the moment think of the index business is being driven by those two the economics and bond businesses pushing 20%, 25% growth and therefore lower double digits overall for the whole group. But margins are good, the incremental margins all that stuff is very, very attractive.
On the KYC side, that continues to cost us money. Certainly hurting our margin and solutions and across the group. I think I remember the accounting for that we have charged services to the JV that is booked as revenue that showed a modest increase this quarter but it's a small number. We then take a share of the loss back in terms of numbers. So overall it's negative for our EBITDA, making an investment that sort of stabilized I think at the time for the last three months our share result is about a loss of $2.4 million, I think our overall losses is a little bit bigger than that in terms of EBITDA impact we think that's a relatively stable number at this point made the investment ground up team and as Lance mentioned doing a good job to trying to bring more by side terms onto the platform and think thatâs enormously helpful but I think for the time being that continue to be drag of results through this year. I think many of us, [indiscernible] in the past, when are we getting to breakeven I think given the target at the end of this year I think thatâs going to be a challenge to breakeven by the end of this year probably into next year at this point.
Joseph Foresi
And then, you talked about I think the $100 million in revenue synergies, for IHS Markit merger. I think you talked about $125 million in cost revenue synergies. Are we still on track for that? And do you have a similar breakdown there?
Lance Uggla
Yes. So we did when we first got together we laid out our view on the cost side and we modeled out a significant amount of that $125 million so we felt it was very obtainable and available for us to execute on. We're now we have now made the engagement of the post-merger integration consultant. We're working through benchmarking and timings and I can definitely reaffirm that our objectives of the $100 million low hanging fruit in the $125 million of costs are very achievable and we expect to execute on that as said.
Joseph Foresi
Okay and then the last one for me, I think you talked about the financial services sales cycle elongating. Is that due to the market volatility or is there a shift in the end market and then just a kind of build on that, should we expect a slowdown in a businesslike solutions when you see some market volatility like we did in Q1?
Lance Uggla
Right. I don't think the two are necessarily perfectly tied together. So I personally wouldn't look at them that way, Joseph, but I would look more that we're in a tough macroeconomic environment whether it's looking at China, whether it's looking at Middle East tensions, refugee crisis in Europe, BRICs [ph] there's just a lot going on around all of us. So I think that the fact that there is the macroeconomic environment leads us to question, you know the U.S. jobs numbers. There's a whole bunch of things that just make us question things. Our customers are all under pressure to take cost out. So that bodes really well for Markit and it showing up in our pipeline. But it's just taking longer times to make the decisions. 
And so the sales cycles increased because people are trying to delay the decisions as long as they can to manage their revenue expense outcomes. And so I don't think it changes any of my view. I like how we're positioned. I think the volatility in the market is a double-edged sword sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad it's not necessarily any perfect correlation in markets history. And I think that given the world just seems and feels a little tougher, as we headed into 2016 and where was in 2015, that's slowing things down a little bit, but nothing I would put a red flag to personally.
Jeff Gooch
Just clarifying answers to make sure I was 100% clear the 25% increase in sales time was specifically to software contracts and more generally we have seen elongation.
Lance Uggla
Right. That's good too.

Our final question comes from Vincent Hung from Autonomous.
Vincent Hung
So you mentioned the new business wins in pricing and reference there. Can you talk about the opportunities that are left in pricing and reference data in terms of new customer acquisition is it mainly the buy side and if so which segments of the buy side?
Lance Uggla
I think there's a few things I suppose buy side and sell side, this is a big market hundreds of millions of dollars in total spend per annum. And increasing in size as participants want more independence, one, and two, they would like not just one but two suppliers. And I think it I describe it as again if I think back in time when people were recording prices and books and ledgers if they got a price wrong, they phoned up a supplier and corrected the price in a book and there wasn't a lot to worry about or they fixed it up at the end of the next month and there wasn't all the regulatory pressure.
Today, the pressure for accuracy comes twofold, one, the regulatory pressure and potential for litigation is just so high that everybody is afraid of getting something wrong. The second thing is, as we all use technologies of stuff arrives a lot faster and we're expected to get it right. Human error is not accepted. And so, if I look at what that means to our customers, it means they want to process and they also want to backup process so the expandable market or addressable market is coming from the fact that independents, regulation and info security, a whole bunch of things that are relevant to the world we live in surrounded with technology means that the spends are higher.
So I think that's bodes really well and so we're picking up market share in that we have great solutions that use technology and have good solid resilient operational processes, info security processes etcetera around it.
The second thing I would say is there has been a consolidation. So for example, ICE bought IDC, they also bought CMA, they do something with S&P and next thing you know there are two sources are coming from the same supplier. We saw that in the muni space. That fuels participants to want to diversify and that then fuels our services. So we become beneficiaries of consolidation around us. So I think there's more data being bought, regulation and technology and litigation is making sure that people don't get things wrong so they want backup processes and we've got great products that's probably the best reason with good people building them and offering them to our customers.
Vincent Hung
Okay. And sticking with pricing and reference there, could you segment the existing user base by front office versus middle and back office users?
Lance Uggla
Yes. I would say I don't have the exact numbers but I can give you a gut feel for what I would say. When we start the firm it was all back-office, it was all about people marking books. As you started to build up history where you had three, four, five years plus a history, actually you've got data that pre-trade starts to be interesting. So the researchers, the trading assistants and traders, software pre-trade software started to want to consume our data and so given that the contract was sold into a buy side or sell side firm, that data could be readily made available through hundreds of alliance partners in terms of pre-trade software and positioning and many of the middle and back-office functions.
So we really have penetrated our data sets pre and post-trade. I'm not sure what the split is on that usage but I would say more than 70% is probably still are about 70% might be supporting once the trade is done and 30% helping drive decisions pre-trade. You then get into buy side and sell side and they are actually I would say the biggest growth area for us is by side and continues to be so. A lot of it is driven through the fund administrators who actually price the portfolios for the buy side, so Northern trust, the [indiscernible], state streets, these are over here the B&P security services, the big servicers of the assets. But we also seeing direct usage of our data by the buy side increasing. And then on the sell side, we have been a substantive winner of the sell side penetration and contracts since we developed our products and continue to see good usage there although the growth wouldnât be as high as the buy side.
Vincent Hung
Okay and just last one for me, following the merger with IHS, would you consider selling the processing business?
Lance Uggla
I think the processing business is very, very important part of Markit. I think it's been one we struggled to obviously explaining to you since we IPOed. But in the context of IHS market it's much smaller, it's a very high margin business. It definitely produces great cash flow. It's run by a great team and we have invested in new areas for growth. So we're very excited about our position in the FX space we see that as a growth space and we see our positioning in the other markets as being substatntive and ones that we can leverage across the customer set. I will give you an example, we talked today about FRTB which is the fundamental review of trading books that requires historical look back of trades to determine whether parts of the data sets can be modeled for capital release.
And the data sets that we're using in our solutions are actually coming out of our processing division. So here is an asset against described as processing thatâs actually powering a solution with data and the data is coming from the trades. So I see all of the parts of market as very integrated, very much driving customer cross sell, new opportunities and our ability to serve our customers well and grow our reputation. So no, I don't have it on any piece of paper or thought in terms of selling processing.
But I hope you think that we also think very strategically about everything and all our businesses and together IHS and Markit will make sure that we've got that product set that delivers the shareholder growth and the opportunity to innovate with new products and processing has always played a role in that with Markit.
