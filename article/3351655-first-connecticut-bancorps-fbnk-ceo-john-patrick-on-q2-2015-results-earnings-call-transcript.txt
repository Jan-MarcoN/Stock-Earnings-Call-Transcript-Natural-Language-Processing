Good morning and welcome to the First Connecticut Bancorp Incorporated Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After todayâs presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer Daukas. Please go ahead maâam.
Jennifer Daukas
Thank you, Denise. Good morning everyone. As Denise said, my name is Jennifer Daukas and I am the Investor Relations Officer of First Connecticut. Before we begin with our presentation, weâd like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcements. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor afforded by that advisement.
Thank you and now here is John Patrick, our Chairman, President and CEO.
John Patrick
Thanks Jennifer. Good morning everyone and thanks for your interest in our Company and attending today's conference call. Recognizing that there is a ton of earnings releases today and calls, we'll be brief with our remarks. We recognize that you all know how to read our release and mostly in the numbers there is not a great deviation from anything that we've been doing in the past over the last several quarters.
That said, based on our strategic objectives in organic growth, I think we've continued to make a very good progress on our financial results generating positive operating leverage for the quarter. This quarter was really highlighted by continued good loan growth, and I will say that it has strong asset quality with the growth that we are putting on.
Our deposits were flat quarter-to-quarter, but I think you should take a year-over-year 15% deposit growth we had in conjunction. The loans outpace the deposit growth, but we are pleased with how our branches continue to grow and the return that we are seeing on the investments that we've made in the de novo branches.
I think during the quarter, we announced the locations for two branches one in West Springfield and the other one in East Longmeadow and we continue to see good opportunities in those markets and we'll be pleased when we are open with those offices up there and if they have the same results of what we've done with previous de novo branches that should add another slug of significant deposits to our Company as well as good core deposit accounts.
The fundamentals of our Company continue to remain very, very, solid and we're focused on taking in deposits and making good volumes. I think another thing we've always been focused on from a shareholder perspective is continuing to drive long-term shareholder value. Our tangible book value per share grew to $15.01 during the quarter, and as I said before, the fundamentals for our company continue to remain very, very strong from both on the asset side and on the liability side.
One of the things that I will point out I think that while we donât give a lot of forward guidance, we as a company continue to remain asset sensitive in our balance sheet and our balance sheet structure. As we continue to look forward into the future, we recognize the fact that we are focused on ROE, ROA, and EPS, and we've discussed that with many of you. But also one of the things that we are focused on is our loan to deposit ratio. We believe that we have some good strategies in place relative to managing loan to deposit, and we manage that on an ongoing basis.
And with that said, one of the things that we will be looking at in the third quarter is exploring a strategy relative to securitizing a piece of our mortgage portfolio not shrinking the balance sheet, but looking at the securitization which would transfer loans off the balance sheet into a security, and as I said before, we are comfortable with the quality and underwriting of our loans and we feel comfortable in doing that.
And that would provide some relief to our loan to deposit ratio as we get all our offices up and running. But that said, the organic growth on a net new account basis for deposit accounts in the second quarter was very good and very strong. If you remember, we were a little flat in the first quarter, some of that due to weather related. It was a tough winter here in New England, but we're back on track with the number of net new accounts that we are opening today.
So, I'll turn it over to Greg to see if he has any additional comments that he would like to comment on and then we'll open up for questions.
Gregory White
Yes, the only thing I think is worth empathizing, the first bullet of the financial highlights, we talked about our net interest income was up $724,000 versus the prior quarter. So, thatâs a 4.4% growth rate quarter-over-quarter or almost 18% on an annualized basis, certainly worth mentioning there I think will probably be an outlier to the positive there, we certainly expect.
All right, the only other comment I would make is just to recommend and direct listeners to the last page of the press release, we have a non-GAAP table. We're probably all seeing non-GAAP tables that maybe push the envelope a little bit, this is not one of them, very straight forward non-GAAP table. I would almost call it conservative, and I would call it conservative quite awfully.
And there you could see that our core EPS went to $0.19 in the second quarter from $0.16 in the first quarter, so good core earnings growth there. And thatâs it John.
John Patrick
Great, thanks Greg. You know again, we are very pleased with where we are. We continue to make progress in moving the Company forward. As Greg said, focused on our earnings per share growth or tangible book value growth, and the fundamentals within the company remain strong in this environment that we're in today. So with that, as I said before, you've all read the numbers, you know how to analyze them.
I will open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We have question from Travis Lan from KBW. Please go ahead.
Travis Lan
Yes, thanks. Good morning guys.
John Patrick
Good morning.
Travis Lan
Could you just clarify, was the retirement stock comp or the accelerated investing, I guess in the compensation line or the other line?
Gregory White
That was in the other.
Travis Lan
Okay. Alright, so is it good run rate for expenses going forward kind of that $15.2 million if you net out the accelerated vesting and then the credit loss?
Gregory White
Correct, which we donât - we did not put in the non-GAAP table.
Travis Lan
Right, okay and then what you think -- kind of the trajectory of expenses from here, you know if you look out are there investments to be made or is it more on the margin?
John Patrick
Yes, I think that you know our expense is going to be, we are trying to maintain our expenses relatively flat. The only expense that I see Travis quite frankly is the investment that we are making in the branch offices. And I've talked to the Street and you guys about that over the course of the last several years on our de novo strategy. The investment was pretty significant early on and as we streamline our ability to open these branch offices, you know we have gone really from the first ones costing about $1 million to do.
But when we were in the throes of opening the branches, I would tell you that it was $700,000 per branch and when we're doing three years, so that was about $2.1 million drag. We've got that costs down to a little lower half a million bucks per branch and so thatâs come down. Itâs still going to be there, and we as a Company have several initiatives going on relative to operational efficiency, and as a result of that we have been able to reallocate resources in certain areas and so the largest expense has been the HR expense, and we have been able to maintain that as a minimum and we continue to see that going forward.
Travis Lan
Okay, and the two new branches, they arenât you the numbers at all, yet are they?
John Patrick
No.
Travis Lan
Okay. Okay, with continued credit improvement, is there more room to bring the reserve to loans down a little bit, I mean slowly?
John Patrick
Yes, I donât know about that. You know, obviously thatâs driven by our models and our accountants and quite frankly we've seen some very good loan growth. I think we're on about a 16% annualized loan growth right now and some of that has to do with â our reserves have to do with the growth, the numbers and I can tell you that the assets that we are putting on are very low risk rated assets quality within the portfolio. But I'm comfortable with where we are today, and more importantly I think the number that might come down is reserves to NPLs I think as we continue to see some improvement there. There have been some loans that have been here for a long period of time, and the foreclosure process in Connecticut is very, very slow, and we are starting to see some progress in moving those out of that line through OREO and out. So thatâs the area I may see that number come down as things improve or actually it might go up a little bit as things improve.
Travis Lan
All right, okay, that's helpful. Just a couple more Greg, is there more of a room for the funding cost to come down, kind of the promotions that were earlier in the year? 
Gregory White
Not much. No I wouldnât count on that. You know in part because we were flat on the non-municipal deposits, I'm sorry on total deposits for the quarter, so I wouldnât expect that now.
Travis Lan
Okay, and then so the margin outlook from here is a little bit of pressure?
Gregory White
I mean you see we still have room â I mean the securities helped out. We still have plenty of room there. If you want to kind of offset the loan compression with some securities transactions, I mean basically what we did is we got rid of above 40 million of treasuries during the quarter, and for the most part went into kind of shorter term agencies, the longest one being a 5-year maturity, but with that said, it does have -- you can see the change in the yield is pretty significant.
Travis Lan
All right.
Gregory White
So, I mean that would be an offset, and again it depends on the amount of loans that we swapped. So, for example, this quarter we swapped about 60% of our commercial real estate. So that you know that is going to trickle over into the next quarter, and thatâs a little higher than typical. You know, we are obviously -- we are swapping up higher rate, fix rate loan into a LIBOR float or so. That does add to a little bit of the compression on the asset side. But with that said, we have the ability to offset it on with investments, which we did because of the uptick in rates.
Travis Lan
Got you.
John Patrick
The other thing Travis, I just want to comment on the liability side. We are really, the one thing we are doing too is experimenting with the elasticity of where rates are on the other side. Obviously we are overpaid, but there are certain bases [ph] you can go to. So we're experimenting a little bit with that, especially with their ability to cross-sell into that customer base when we ran by market special and some destructive mailings and campaigns earlier in the year.
Travis Lan
Got you. Okay, just to clarify on this potential strategy you are outlining John for the loan deposit management, you are talking about actually securitizing some of your residential loans and then instead of selling them, just putting them in the securities portfolio is that right?
John Patrick
Thatâs correct.
Travis Lan
Okay good and then the last one is just the outlook for your swap income, obviously that was a pretty good number in the quarter, is that something that you would expect to continue or will that come back down a little bit?
John Patrick
I think it is you know quite frankly, itâs going to be indicative of whatâs in the pipeline and the deals that are out there. We donât push swaps on anybody. I think that we have some very sophisticated real estate borrowers that we do deal with, and they look at what their investment strategy is relative to the respective real estate property that they have.
And I think that during the quarter we had a good month relative to our commercial real estate growth, so it will be dependent a little bit upon that and I would say that probably this past quarter was, we didnât have, I donât believe we had any swap fee income in the first quarter. We had some of those loans in the first quarter close in the second. So I wouldnât think that we would have this high number in the third quarter going forward.
Travis Lan
Got it. All right thank you guys, very much.
John Patrick
Yes, thanks Travis.
Operator
And our next question is from Louis Feldman from Wells Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Louis Feldman
Good morning gentlemen. Travis got my question, so itâs been answered.
John Patrick
So, how are solar panels?
Louis Feldman
They are rocking man. Itâs been so hot and so warm out here that we are generating a megawatt pretty much almost every 22 days.
John Patrick
Great.
Louis Feldman
Loving it, we will see you next week, thank you gentlemen.
John Patrick
Thank you.
Operator
Iâm showing no further questions at this time, we will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to John Patrick for any closing remarks.
John Patrick
Thank you, again. I now recognize it is a busy day for all of you as it for us, and we appreciate your interest in our Company. The fundamentals for our Company remain strong. I think the management and the board are very focused on driving shareholder value. We understand where we need to go. We understand we need to drive ROA, ROE, and EPS and growing organically has been our strategy. We will continue to be going forward and we have got some nice momentum and movement in our numbers and I think that will be the continued theme as we move forward. So, thanks again for your interest and have a great day.
Operator
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending todayâs presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
