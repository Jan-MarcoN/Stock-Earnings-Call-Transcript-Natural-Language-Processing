Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2013 IHS Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sue, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Schulz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Andrew Schulz
Thank you, Sue. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the IHS First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our earnings release earlier this morning. If you do not have a copy of this release, it is available on our website at ihs.com.
Some of our comments and discussions on the quarter are based on non-GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP or adjusted numbers exclude stock-based compensation and other noncash charges and other items. Our earnings release includes both our GAAP-based income statement and statement of cash flows and the reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures discussed during this call. These reconciliation schedules can also be found on our website.
The non-GAAP results are a supplement to the GAAP financial statements. IHS believes this non-GAAP presentation and the exclusion of these items is useful in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance.
As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and webcast and is the copyrighted property of IHS. Any rebroadcast of this information, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of IHS is prohibited.
Please keep in mind that this conference call, especially the discussion of our outlook, may contain statements about expected future events that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ and vary materially from expectations can be found in IHS' filings with the SEC and on the IHS website.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerre Stead, IHS Chairman and CEO. Jerre?
Jerre L. Stead
Thank you, Andy, and good morning, and welcome to all of our investors and to my IHS colleagues. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning to share our results from the first quarter.
Regarding the quarterly financial highlights, revenue was up 12% in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.9%. Free cash flow was $112 million. Q1 proved to be exactly what we thought it would be, solid and steady performance in the face of continued uncertain macroeconomic times.
Therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2013, reflecting revenue growth of 9%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 16% and adjusted EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint of our ranges. Scott Key, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Rich Walker, our Executive VP of Global Finance; and Todd Hyatt, our Senior VP, Chief Financial Officer and IT officer, will provide more details shortly.
Nearly 2 years ago, we noted that we were about to embark on an 8-quarter period of immense transformation impacting every aspect of our infrastructure. Since then, we've been deploying new systems, implementing new processes and putting in place the right teams and structures as the foundation for our future. The great work our team has been doing and continues to do today is all about 2 things: delighting customers and enabling our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth well into the future. Today, we're less than one quarter away from completing the most intensive part of this process.
As we finish the first half of our year, we will see an increasing amount of our internal effort move away from infrastructure activities and towards our commercial initiatives, including the initial phase of the rollout of our common workflow platform, and there will be far less changed management internally. With our new systems, we are leveraging the improved line of sight into our business and are seeing sales force and company-wide productivity increases.
Throughout this period of significant investment and change, we've continued to drive meaningful margin expansion and strong free cash flow as reflected by our Q1 results. It's truly an exciting time to be at IHS, and the best is yet to come. My many thanks to my colleagues for their hard work, diligence and performance, as we are investing at the highest levels in our history.
Our largest infrastructure initiative is Vanguard, our platform to support business growth and to drive common global processes. This initiative is delivering value and delight to our customers, as well as improving productivity and effectiveness for our colleagues through global streamlined processes. On March 1, we reached another important milestone as we went live with the fifth release, this one covering all of our Canadian operations. With this successful release, we are approximately 90% complete with our implementation plan for Vanguard.
In the midst of all this foundational infrastructure work, we kicked off our second quarter in style with the 32nd IHS CERAWeek in Houston. IHS CERAWeek is the leading gathering of senior energy decision makers and business leaders from around the world. It featured presentations from over 300 speakers, including senior industry executives, government officials and thought leaders. IHS CERAWeek 2013 was a timely gathering that delivered unparalleled insight, critical analysis and clarity on the future of energy in a changing world. This year's conference focused on drivers of change in geopolitics, markets and the new map of energy. The energy industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by new technologies, shift in global demand, regulatory uncertainties and the new realities of global supply. At the same time, growing economic uncertainty with geopolitical tensions all pose new risk and new challenges as companies invest to meet future energy needs.
Conference reinforced that IHS offerings are fundamental to our customers' core workflows and are used everyday to help our customers advance decisions that advance the world. This year's conference, topics, attendance and discussion reflected the many connections our company is making across the key capital-intensive industries that drive global supply chains and economies. And it highlighted the impact that IHS has as we bring information, analytics and expertise to customers' critical decisions.
Signaling the business importance of this IHS event, media coverage and attendance surpassed all previous years with a record 254 registered journalists and more than 2,800 news articles, representing a significant increase over 2012. IHS CERAWeek is a great example of the continued progress we're making in elevating our position externally as the leader in each of the vertical markets where we continue to build scale and momentum. We are still rolling up the final results. However, this year's conference was a great success in building IHS presence and value for our customers in a key market.
IHS CERAWeek is not our only marquee industry event. In fact, the 2013 IHS World Petrochemical Conference is wrapping up this week in Houston. Now in its 28th year, we have had an outstanding gathering of executives across the global petrochemical industry. There's been a robust dialogue focused on the rapidly changing landscape that is creating new challenges and opportunities. The industry is repositioning for an evolving global energy landscape and the resurgence of North American oil and gas production.
With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott C. Key
Thanks, Jerre. During the first quarter, we continued to deliver steady performance, well above market and economic growth rates. We grew 5% organically overall, in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance since uncertainty engulfed the global economy late last summer. This performance also provides a good start to 2013, and we are still early in our new product introduction process and still completing our transformational initiatives that will fully enable our sales force and maximize sales efficiency. Importantly, we continued to deliver a steady 7% organic subscription growth during Q1. We benefited from some in-period items that helped us round up to 8%, and it means we have sustained organic subscription growth at 7% or higher for almost 3 years despite a turbulent economic and business environment over this period.
Looking at subscription organic growth performance by region, all 3 regions performed well. Americas subscription grew organically at a solid 8%, and EMEA organic subscription growth was a steady 6% for the quarter, which is really impressive performance in a region wracked by recession. APAC continued its strong organic subscription growth trend growing 11% during Q1, reflecting the solid focus of our teams and impact of our expanded infrastructure and investment in the region over the past 2 years.
Non-subscription revenue continues to have its challenges in the current climate. Non-subscription revenues represented approximately 20% of total revenues for the quarter and declined 8% organically. As context, note that Q1 is traditionally our lowest quarter for non-subscription sales, where Q4 is the highest.
Our Q1 performance was similar to what we have seen the last 2 quarters. The 8% organic decline for non-subscription revenue represents a $5 million organic reduction versus the prior year and reflected a mix of some underperforming nonstrategic assets and continued weakness in customers' discretionary spending globally. This is clearly not where we want to be, and it is an area of focus for us. But let's realize this does not represent a large absolute dollar decline relative to our total business.
Furthermore, based on our current sales pipelines and product release schedules, our full year expectation for the non-subscription business is to see improvement as the year progresses and as we look for corporate discretionary spend to improve in the second half of 2013. Rich will provide further details on regional revenue growth in a moment.
Let me now briefly update you on our market and sector outlook. As we look at the economic and corporate growth environment around us, we continue to see weak economic growth trends globally and uncertainty and tight business spending patterns for the near term. Despite the record highs being experienced by equity markets, the real world continues to struggle, with corporations using more of their cash to repurchase shares than in making clear commitments to invest in growth.
Our economists are still projecting relatively flat global growth for the full year 2013 against prior year levels, and this has not changed despite some recent optimism for U.S. housing markets. Fourth quarter 2012 corporate earnings growth continued to outpace sluggish revenue growth, signaling continued cost control and cost cutting to improve earnings by corporations and our customers.
Moreover, thus far for Q1 2013, negative earnings pre-announcements issued by S&P 500 corporations are outpacing positives by 4 to 1, the highest level since 2001. In the U.S., some mild signs of recovering are appearing as evidenced by an uptick in manufacturing and exports in recent months. However, this appears likely only to be offset negative impacts due to government indecision, but the sequester will potentially pull second quarter growth below 1% again. With a partial sequester extending through June, U.S. growth would slow to 1.8% for the full year 2013.
More specifically for IHS with respect to the sequester, we have seen a slowing in government agencies' spending decisions recently, and we expect about $3 million in revenue and profit will shift from the first half of 2013 to the second half as a result. This is grounded in our belief the sequester will not be rapidly resolved between now and June 1.
For the Eurozone, the situation has worsened and recession deepened. With the GDP drop of 0.6% in Q4, all major economies contracted, including Germany. Output also fell 0.6%. All told, the Eurozone economy is expected to contract by 0.3% this year. With the Manufacturing Purchasers Managers' Index at 47.9 in February, this marks the 19th consecutive month below the 50-point threshold between expansion and contraction in the Eurozone.
Japan returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 where GDP rose 0.2% on an annualized basis compared to estimates of a 0.4% contraction as we exited 2012. Japan appears to be emerging from its third recession in 3 years, although an uptick in industrial production in recent months has not been matched in exports, which continued to decline slightly.
Regarding China, despite the recent uptick in Chinese exports, personal consumption and domestic demand continues to be weak, which will continue to negatively impact exports from the Eurozone and other Asian and emerging market economies. Chinese industrial production decelerated in recent months, continuing a slow decline since mid-2010, and the manufacturing PMI continued to hover around the 50-point threshold.
In summary, we are not seeing signs yet of renewed or improving growth for spend drivers for corporations, and we now have new U.S. headwinds in government markets. We continue to look for concrete signs that would indicate an improving second half of 2013.
Fourth quarter 2012 earnings growth continued to struggle, but now let's turn to IHS performance in our key markets. Despite this continued challenging global business environment, we see solid growth in a number of our end markets along with weakness in others. Energy growth is robust worldwide with continued double-digit organic growth across our subscription offerings. Chemicals, particularly subscriptions, continue to do well globally with strong organic growth as we continue to benefit from the integration of our broad capabilities following the launch of IHS Chemicals 1 year ago. Transportation continues to perform well as we increase market presence and market share globally. And auto's performance is particularly strong with a positive market response to the common IHS automotive platform launched in 2012. Electronics growth remained weak in response to significant reduction in customer spending. Government and defense and security continue to be challenged as government spend remains under pressure globally and particularly in EMEA.
Turning to our commercial development activities. We continue to invest in our growth across our offerings and high-growth markets. As we complete the global infrastructure buildout that is a key lever to future growth and operating leverage, we are also integrating legacy products on the common workflow platforms across our 5 core customer workflows. We expect these efforts will result in a continued high level of new product releases in 2013, 2014 and 2015, as well as the retirement of legacy systems and costs.
We anticipate positive impacts to organic growth in upsell, cross-sell and new business generation as we exit 2013 and realize a strong margin profile on this growth. We look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming 2013 Investor Day to be webcast April 10 when we will outline a clear roadmap of new product and workflow platform deployment that will be a foundational element of our organic growth through 2015 and beyond. We are also managing a solid M&A pipeline of high-quality assets with clear strategic prioritization that should enhance our industry and workflow strategies and drive accretive growth in margins as we continue to build IHS scale and market presence globally.
In summary, we continue to see a slow economic and corporate spend environment and have not yet seen concrete signs that would lead to a second half improvement in markets and growth. We see new headwinds in the U.S. in the near term as Congress grapples with required tax and spend decisions and deadlines. We continue to invest in our business as we complete key infrastructure projects and develop our core commercial platforms and bring new capabilities to market. We are managing our cost base in a lower-growth environment to ensure we balance investment for future growth with consistent expansion of margins towards our long-term goals. And finally, we are delivering a high level of free cash flow that is a result of a strong subscription-based business model, which also features solid margins and low capital requirements.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich, who will take you through the details of our Q1 performance.
Richard G. Walker
Thank you, Scott. I'll provide an overview of our results and a reaffirmation of our 2013 annual guidance. Let's start with revenue. First quarter 2013 revenue increased 12% to $383 million. The growth in revenue includes 5% organic growth and 7% growth from acquisitions. FX was negligible for the quarter. Although not material to the quarter, FX is something we will need to keep our eye on as we saw a more pronounced impact as we exited the quarter.
Subscriptions represented 80% of revenue and grew organically 8% in the first quarter, representing our 11th consecutive quarter of 7% or higher organic subscription growth. Our non-subscription businesses declined 8% organically or approximately $5 million as Scott outlined earlier.
Looking at regional performance. Americas' overall organic revenue growth was 3%, and Americas subscriptions grew organically at a solid 8%. EMEA's organic revenue growth was 4% with a 6% organic growth rate in subscriptions, again, pretty terrific performance in a recessionary environment. APAC's overall organic growth was very strong at 15% led by subscription organic growth of 11%.
Turning now to profit and margins. Q1 adjusted EBITDA totaled $118 million, up 14% versus a year ago. Our adjusted EBITDA margin improved as expected and was almost 31% in the first quarter. This is a 70 basis point increase over last year and solid expansion given the current lower-growth environment in which we are exercising good cost discipline.
Moving down the P&L. Adjusted EPS increased to $0.86 per diluted share in the first quarter, a $0.09 improvement over the prior year. Regarding segment profitability, Americas' adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $93.8 million. EMEA's adjusted EBITDA was down 4% to $24.1 million due primarily to increased selling costs, and APAC's adjusted EBITDA grew 23% to $10.2 million. We were very pleased with the profit growth in APAC as we are realizing the benefit of our investments over the last 2 years. The reported GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 19.4%.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $319 million of cash and $1.05 billion of debt. Deferred revenue at the end of Q1 was $628 million, an increase of 10% on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to cash flow. We had a very strong quarter as expected. We generated $112 million in the first quarter, improving our trailing 12-month conversion of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow to 69%, in line with our past performance and annual expectations. Also on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow per share was $5.14, the highest in our company's history.
We continue to maintain our outlook and guidance range for 2013. Our guidance is on an all-in basis and assumes no further acquisitions, currency movements, pension mark-to-market adjustments or unanticipated events. For 2013, we are reaffirming our guidance and expect all-in revenue in a range of $1.64 billion to $1.71 billion, including an overall organic growth rate expected to be between 5% to 7% at the midpoint; all-in adjusted EBITDA in a range of $540 million to $582 million; and adjusted EPS between $4.23 and $4.43 per diluted share.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Jerre.
Jerre L. Stead
Thanks, Rich. We are off to a very solid start to what should prove to be a very good year for IHS. Please join us for our 2013 Investor Day to be webcast on April 10, during which we will map out our very exciting future. Scott, Rich, Todd and I are now ready to answer your questions, so let's start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We're ready to go, Sue.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray.
Peter P. Appert - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division
So I thought that Scott's tone sounded particularly cautious in terms of his commentary on no signs of recovery to headwinds from the government. And given the essentially in-line first quarter results and what sounded like more cautious commentary, you're reaffirming the guidance. So what has to happen to get to the numbers? Do we need to see some macro improvement to get there?
Jerre L. Stead
It's a good question, Peter. What Scott was trying to do is reflect what our world's leading economists are telling everybody, and actually, we're giving you free guidance today, which we would normally charge for with what's going on in the world. We reaffirmed guidance, which I think as the world continues the 9% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth is going to look better and better compared to a lot of the rest of the world. Our only point was that, as you know, we said at the beginning of -- when we gave guidance actually in December that we would expect to see a 1-plus percent shift out of the first half into the second half of our revenue as compared to historical basis. Scott's point is we've yet to see that, didn't say it won't happen, didn't say anything different will happen. We just yet to see it. We'll continue to look through that in Q2, and that's why we wanted to be specific, Peter, on reconfirming guidance because we feel very good about where we're at with that point. Scott?
Scott C. Key
Yes, Peter. Thanks a lot. So when we gave guidance, we talked about 5% to 7% in terms of our growth goals for the year. Of course, we're delivering 5%, and we also, as Jerre said, told you, we'd update you each quarter as the year progressed. And as you know, we saw some bellwethers yesterday announce their earnings and of course, struggle in the current economy. And we are watchful to see how spend and investment develops through the year and again, are looking for those positive signs for acceleration in the second half.
Jerre L. Stead
And I think all that does, Peter, is reconfirm the must-have nature of our products, hitting 80% of our total revenue in the first quarter at subscription base, just a good sign and a good start. Thanks, Peter.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Dobell of William Blair.
Brandon Burke Dobell - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division
From a sales force perspective given all the different kind of puts and takes and different kind of categories of revenue, are you guys making any changes as to how you allocate salespeople, kind of how you hire people? Or is it steady as she goes and you're just going to hang out and wait for the [ph] macro to come back in line?
Jerre L. Stead
No, a great question, Brandon. I'll start, and Scott will pick up on it. As we talked about last year and you're going to see a lot more of that on April 10 at our Investor Day, as we shift focus to the companies that are not currently in our 1,000 largest that should be, we are standing up, and we'll continue to, those accounts with the a new focus as we shift sales focus. Scott, pick up on it. It's a very good timely question.
Scott C. Key
Yes. Thanks so much, and of course, with the deployment of new systems, this is what we've been building for, for a couple of years with really the ability to have a greater efficiency in the sales force and Brandon, to your point, to shift focus where we can generate greater value. So several things you're seeing. We continue to focus on emerging markets, and you saw a really solid 15% growth in APAC. And that's a result of our focus there and growth in sales capacity. As Jerre said, we're also -- and you'll see this as we discuss the next 3 years -- focusing on upsell and cross-sell in our core accounts and putting more resources there. But importantly, as we've built great capability and depth in each industry, targeting those accounts where we should have a much larger presence. So we are bringing new sales resource and new expense in that direction and also ensuring we continue to perform well as you see sales, resource and expense in EMEA strong as we drive above market growth there.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Barclays Capital.
Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Pinchhitting for Manav this morning. So can you give us an update on IHS Connect? And really, I guess, what I'm wondering is 2 things. How successful have you been to date in upselling more product into customer within a vertical or even just cross selling different verticals? And secondly, when did the other verticals beyond energy get this platform that you showed us at Investor Day a year ago?
Jerre L. Stead
Great question. What we're going to give you -- I'll start, and then Scott is pleased to pick up on that. What we're going to take it all the way for you on April 10 and show you all of the work platforms coming, what they're going to look like, when they're going to deliver, et cetera. We actually did that with our board 2 weeks ago and feel very good about it. So Scott, give them facts as our friends on where we're at and where we're going to be.
Scott C. Key
Yes. Thanks, Gary. Appreciate the questions. So one, some context, so we've got 5 workflow platforms that we're bringing all of our capability to each industry. So Connect is one of those platforms and really ties to about $450 million in annual revenue, so clearly, an important workflow platform for us and drives into the top of corporations and decision-making. So we've released all of energy, great update last July to complete the energy suite and a couple of additions as we ended 2012. And we're seeing great uptake in energy on Connect. And to your point about cross-sell and upsell, so this is the point of the platform, and it surfaces all of our subscriptions around strategic capital and operating decision-making. And we saw a lot of strength, and we mentioned this on Q4. In fact, cross-sell commissions, which we incent specifically, was quite high in Q4, so good momentum, a 10,000 or so active users on the platform year end. So a year ago, we had 0, now 10,000, so good uptake. And we'll see us drive conversion to that platform in the coming 3, 4 months, and that will really be the lever to start driving more expansive and more consistent upsell and cross-sell. So we'll see momentum as the year progresses and into next year. To your last question, energy is out. Next up is chemicals, and we're working that hard right now and expect to start showing that to customers in the coming quarters. And then we'll march across with every other vertical over the next 8 quarters or so.
Jerre L. Stead
And Just a quick comment on Sphera because that's made great progress. Scott, as a reminder...
Scott C. Key
And to be clear, then, the other platforms, which cover all of our revenue, a great progress on Sphera and EHS&S, first things out last year and good momentum there, big releases this year in energy technical, which, of course, is really significant for us and then huge progress on our engineering workbench where we'll see a lot of momentum by midyear. And as Jerre said, we'll outline this for you at Investor Day. So it should be fun to watch how this develops over the next 12 quarters.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse.
Kelly A. Flynn - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG, Research Division
So I'm just trying to better understand the impact of the sequester as you talked about it, Scott. So I guess, my question relates to the second quarter organic growth. I mean, do you think it's reasonable to expect organic growth could drop below 5% in Q2 due mainly to the sequester? Or do you think we're kind of at a stable base here?
Jerre L. Stead
No, good question, Kelly. Pick up on that, Scott. Because we tried to give you all a bit of flavor what we see going on there.
Scott C. Key
Yes. Thanks, Kelly, and it's great to have you on the call today by the way. So we were very specific, about $3 million is what we see delayed out of Q2 into Q3. So that should be a good indicator for you as you think about your models and how you look at Q2. But realize that, that's measured in a very few number of basis points on our overall organic. So we've seen steady. This is second quarter -- actually, third quarter pretty steady at this level both on subscription and non-subscription. We believe that steady growth is going to continue in the second quarter, and of course, then, we're all looking for signs of an improving world in the second half. But the $3 million is delayed. So government is just -- agencies are not making decisions to sign contracts right now. Yesterday, maybe they got some confidence to do that, but we still believe -- that would have to happen in the next 3, 4 weeks for us to see it in the quarter and not push it into Q3.
Jerre L. Stead
The paper has stopped flowing. So assuming they start today even with paper...
Scott C. Key
It'll take weeks, Jerre.
Jerre L. Stead
Yes, exactly.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
The way I see CERAWeek, it's -- as much as expertise, it's also a rich environment for you to meet with and sell and cross sell your energy clients. Is that accurate? Do you feel like that you actually were able to sell additional subscriptions that might be seen near term in energy? Or is that not -- is CERAWeek really not that type of opportunity?
Jerre L. Stead
No, it's a great question, Andrew, and we were glad you were there to be able to get the flavor for that. I'll have Scott add color in a second. But we will actually, at Investor Day, give you some specifics on the number of OSSs that have been created there. We did that last year, and you're very right. It's a very specific opportunity for us. When we talked about it with Brian Sweeney a couple of days ago, as I said, we're still rolling up the numbers. But it is a amazing opportunity. Scott, pick up on it more because it's an excellent thought.
Scott C. Key
That's right. Not only is it a great opportunity for customers to network themselves, and that's a big attraction of the event, as you saw, Andrew. I met with over 20 CEOs and executives to spend time talking about our partnership, and then to your point, it is a great opportunity for us to meet with clients and talk about what else we can do for them. So every year, we come out of CERAWeek with a very specific sales pipeline, and as Jerre suggested, we track sales opportunities that come from those discussion discreetly. So it is a big momentum-building opportunity as we gather with customers and talk about what we can do for them for the year. So we'll track that over the next 6 or 7 months.
Jerre L. Stead
And same thing's happening this week at our worldwide chemicals.
Scott C. Key
That's right. We have over 1,000 executives discussing the year to come and how we support them in a dynamic environment.
Jerre L. Stead
Thanks, Andrew.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Wait, wait. Could you still clarify, do you feel like the energy business could accelerate based on the conversations?
Jerre L. Stead
Good question.
Scott C. Key
Yes, well, this is a feature of the development of business every year, so we do build momentum out of the event in our energy pipelines without a doubt. And that's part of -- we're seasonally higher in the back half and in the fourth quarter, and this is one of the reasons. We have this big opportunity to connect, build pipelines and then we spend 6 months closing and start realizing revenue in Q3 and Q4. So a good point, Andrew.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leben of Robert W. Baird.
Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
First, could you just clarify on the discrete items that benefited the subscription? And then my question is just a comment about the pipelines within EHS&S given the challenges on discrete spending.
Jerre L. Stead
Will do, Dan. Todd, you pick that up for us?
Todd S. Hyatt
Yes. Dan, there were a couple of past-due renewals that came in that lifted the revenue a bit. We see that not unusual in the subscription to have not big amounts but certainly enough to push the rounding up to a favorable position in the quarter.
Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
And then EHS&S?
Todd S. Hyatt
Yes, thanks, Dan. We've been building that business strategically for a couple of years, best of breed across every element of waste and emissions compliance reporting, air, water waste, greenhouse gas, carbon measurement footprint and required compliance there, all the way through safety, operational risk. So you seen us over 3 years build the best of breed onto a common platform. And we've talked about the challenging market and some discretionary spending, but what we're seeing is just dedication by the teams. We're seeing markets understand the importance and the risk in their operations and how they can mitigate that risk by bringing this best-of-breed solutions and common platform into their operations, so just good, dedicated effort, consistent pipeline translating into revenue, so good performance the last 2 quarters. And I think we see a pretty solid stable year there.
Jerre L. Stead
And I'd just add to that, Dan. Thanks for asking. Yesterday, in our monthly customer first worldwide meeting, Scott Lockhart presented how EHS&S is doing. There, we used Walker as our partner in evaluating and measuring our surveys. EHS&S is exceeding best in class in value recognition as a return from our customers. So that tells the story a lot.
Todd S. Hyatt
Sure does.

Thank you. There are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Schulz for closing remarks.
Jerre L. Stead
Thank you very much. This is Jerre. Just before we wrap it up with Andy, again, we very much hope you'll all either attend or tune in on April 10 for our Investor Day. It will be a very special one. As I said at the beginning, we're wrapping up actually 6-plus years of getting ourselves to the position of scalable infrastructure, the right organization, the right people, the right platforms and the right processes. And now we'll be able to share with you where we're going to go, as Scott said, in 2013, '14 and '15 on a ramp of what we believe is a very, very exciting future that we'll be sharing with you then. Thanks, and Andy wrap it up.
