[00:02:08] For those joining by webcast, you can follow along with today's presentation, for those listening by phone, you can access today's presentation on our website at www.youtube.com GAAP. Throughout yesterday's earnings release and our call and presentation today, we refer to adjusted EBITDA adjusted earnings per diluted share cash, earnings per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow. These metrics are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore susceptible to varying calculations, a definition, calculation and reconciliation to the financial statements of adjusted earnings per diluted share cash earnings per diluted share adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow can be found in Exhibit A of our earnings release. We believe these non-cash metrics are useful in evaluating are reported results. We would also like to point out that our third quarter results include contribution from the NRC Group Holdings acquisition that closed on November 1st of 2019. Throughout this presentation, we often refer to NRC Group Holdings as NRC. We have also provided data on standalone U.S. ecology bases, which is referred to as Legacy US ecology. Similarly for standalone NRC data, we refer to that group as Legacy NRC. This disaggregation is an attempt to provide increased transparency and understanding of the underlying business. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Feeler
[00:03:32] Thank you. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you all taking the time to join us today and hope you and your families have remained safe during these uncertain times. Before I have Erik review the third quarter financial results, I'd like to update everyone on how U.S. ecology is navigating the current business environment. For those that are following the webcast presentation, please direct your attention to Slide five. Despite continued covid-19 headwinds, our third quarter results were substantially improved across most of our business units, resulting in an 11 percent sequential improvement in revenue and a 17 percent improvement in our adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter twenty twenty the resilience of our overall business, diversification of our services and execution by our exceptional team, compounded by the capital preservation initiatives implemented earlier this year, resulted in an eight percent improvement in year over year free cash flow. Overall, the company delivered total adjusted EBITDA of forty five point four million dollars, an increase of nine percent over prior year on revenues of two hundred thirty eight point one dollars million year. To date, our adjusted free cash flow fifty one point five million dollars is already ahead of the adjusted free cash flow generated all of twenty nineteen. We ended the quarter with one hundred and two million dollars of cash in approved net debt position from the beginning of the year and repaid thirty million dollars of debt, proactively drawn up our lines of credit. At the beginning of the pandemic, several bright spots emerged this quarter in as industrial activity shows signs of life. Leading the way is our collection of services based business, which generated solid top line growth and EBITDA margin expansion, helping to offset some of the current industrial softness impacting the waste side of the business.
[00:05:29] Moving on to Slide six, Legacy USA called your field and industrial services revenue was up 10 percent, led by strong execution in our small quantity generation emergency response and total waste management services with higher activity levels. This segment also saw adjusted EBITDA margins expand nine basis points, which helped offset the negative operating leverage experience operating leverage experienced on the waste side of the business due to covid-19 induced manufacturing slowdowns are legacy. U.S. Ecology Environmental Services segment revenue declined 12 percent during the quarter, reflecting a 15 percent decline in base business revenue, partially offset by an eight percent growth in our event business as project based shipments remained strong throughout the quarter. Sequentially, base business was down just under one percent from the second quarter of this year, as we saw trends stabilize and start to improve, event business was up 13 percent sequentially. Overall, Legacy USA colleges saw a revenue decline of six percent compared to the third quarter last year, but a 10 percent sequential increase from the second quarter of Twenty twenty legacy U.S. colleges adjusted EBITDA was down eight percent when excluding the two point six dollars million of business interruption procedes recognized in the third quarter of 2019. Sequentially, Legacy U.S. colleges adjusted EBITDA was up seven percent from the second quarter of Twenty twenty. Taking a look at Legates, the NRC results on Slide seven, NRC contributed eighty one million dollars of revenue, which was up 15 percent sequentially from our second quarter, and our revenue was down 21 percent from the prior year, primarily resulting from Energy Waste Services Business.
[00:07:27] NRC generated adjusted EBITDA of nine point seven dollars million in the third quarter, a sequential improvement of 87 percent. And our these field industrial services business saw revenue and EBITDA growth both sequentially and compared to the third quarter last year on increased covid decontamination, industrial and weather based emergency response services as well as synergise. With with revenue in our energy waste disposal business, down 30 percent sequentially from the second quarter, we have worked diligently to take further costs out of the business while adjusting our go to market strategy to focus on non drilling waste opportunities. The resulting EBITDA loss of seven hundred sixty six thousand dollars in the third quarter was a 60 percent improvement over the second quarter of this year. We believe we have rightsize the business for future quarters with some remediation projects and a slight pick in rig count. We believe we have found bottom. We continue to expect this business to be breakeven to slightly positive on an adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA basis in for the full year of twenty twenty. Turning to NRC integration activities, net synergies are ahead of our seven point two million dollar twenty twenty plan for the first nine months of the year. While we still have plenty to do, cost savings are coming in better than anticipated and revenue trends are improving in the third quarter and beyond. As a result, we now expect net synergies to be in the 10 million dollar range for Twenty twenty.Other integration activities have not slowed and we remain on track for our project plans, despite covid and related travel restrictions.
[00:09:18] When you look beyond the quarter to Year-to-date results, the resilience of our business model is even more evident in the first nine months of twenty twenty in the face of a global pandemic, our legacy U.S. ecology business delivered the same level of revenue when compared with the prior year. This translated into us achieving adjusted EBITDA on our legacy U.S. ecology business that was down just three percent from the same period last year. This solid performance underscores the successful execution of our multi-year strategy to grow our services based business to support a robust treatment disposal and recycling network when looking at NRC. We are still in the early stages of realizing the benefits of this combination, while covid-19 and the related impacts on the oil and gas markets have more severely impacted this business than non energy services have begun to show the benefits of the combination. In our third quarter, synergies are trending ahead of our first year targets and the outlook remains promising. Before I turn the call over to Eric, I want to touch on some of what we have been doing with regard to environmental, social and governance initiatives while we published our first Sustainability and Citizenship Report in 2019. We recently formed a separate corporate responsibility and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors to enhance our environmental and social reporting. Updates to our sustainability report are being worked on as we speak and are expected to be updated in early 2001. Being a responsible steward of our environmental resources and promoting a sustainable future is at the heart of what we do every day U.S. ecology since 1952 and for the last 68 years, we have been building U.S. ecology into a leading North American provider of environmental services, where we address the complex waste management needs of our customers and do so with a focus on the environment, our people and our communities.
[00:11:24] Historically, we have not had the metrics to be able to communicate our efforts to stakeholders, and those are being worked on as near-term initiatives. Our environmental response on the environmental responsibility front. While we primarily manage in organic waste at our landfills, we don't generate landfill gas emissions typical of solid waste firms, we are looking to target reductions in vehicle emissions by lowering the carbon footprint of our fleet through things like routing software and improved. Root densities are fixed. Facilities are not high energy users. So the numbers there are already pretty low. Also, over the last five years, we have been upgrading our infrastructure to be more energy efficient as part of our normal growth and capital investments. We are also deploying capital investments to expand our recycling capabilities and technologies and help our customers reduce their overall waste generation as to social responsibility. Our team members are the most important part of U.S. ecology. We realized this long ago. That is our people that drive our success. Taking care of our team members is a top priority, and that begins with a laser focus on health and safety. While we generate safety results that are better than industry standard, we continuously invest in our safety programs and are always looking to make process modifications in an effort to drive to zero incidents. Our social responsibility efforts have created a special culture here at US ecology that is built on inclusion, respect, protecting the environment and continuous improvement in everything we do. We invest in our team members with a total rewards program that includes incentive plans, top tier medical benefits and learning and development programs. This has led to a highly engaged workforce and contributes to our overall low voluntary turnover levels. In the coming years, we will continue to develop and expand on our ESG reporting within with a near-term focus of developing goals for the future or future reporting years. We look forward to updating you on these efforts to make a lasting impact on our environment, our people and our communities. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.
[00:13:46] Thanks, Jeff. As I cover the detailed Financial Review, I'll be discussing consolidated results that include NRC before delving into the legacy or psychology standalone results, starting with consolidated results on Slide 10, revenue for the third quarter of Twenty twenty was two hundred and thirty eight point one dollars million. Revenue for the environmental services segment was one hundred and twelve point four dollars million in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, compared to one hundred and twenty two point two dollars million in the third quarter of 2019. NRC contributed five point one dollars million of its segment revenue in the third quarter of Twenty twenty. The film industrial services segment delivered revenue of one hundred and twenty five point seven dollars million in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, compared to forty five point two dollars million in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Tennessee contributed seventy five point eight dollars million of that fire segment revenue in the third quarter of Twenty twenty. Total gross margin was twenty six percent in the third quarter, down from 34 percent in the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting the addition of NRC, which is largely a service based business, treatment and disposal margin for our environmental services segment, with 38 percent in the third quarter of Twenty twenty and reflected a loss of two point two dollars million from NRD Energy Disposal and Services Business. Gross margin for our film industrial services segment was 19 percent in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, compared to 16 percent in the third quarter of 2019.
[00:15:18] Selling general administrative spending, or GenÃ© was forty nine point nine dollars million and included nineteen point three dollars million for NRC, as well as one point six dollars million in consolidated business development integration expenses. This compared to GenÃ© of twenty eight point eight dollars million in the third quarter last year when excluding four million dollars of business development expenses and nearly five hundred thousand dollars of a favorable property insurance recovery that was not repeated in the third quarter of Twenty twenty. Adjusted earnings per share was twenty five cents in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of 75 cents in the same quarter last year. Cash earnings per diluted share, which adds back the per share impact of the amortization of intangible assets to adjusted earnings per diluted share was forty six cents in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, compared to eighty four cents in the third quarter of 2019. Consolidated, adjusted EBITDA was forty five point four dollars million in the third quarter, up 17 percent from the third quarter of last year, reflecting nine point seven dollars million from Narcy. This was partially offset by an eight percent decline in the legacy USA ecology business when excluding two point six dollars million of business interruption insurance recoveries recorded in the third quarter of 2013. Shifting the legacy U.S. ecology results on slide 11. Revenues were one hundred and fifty seven point two dollars million in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, down six percent from one hundred sixty seven point four dollars million in the third quarter last year.
[00:16:54] For environmental services, segment revenues were down 12 percent to one hundred seven point three dollars million, on a twenty four percent decrease in transportation revenue and a 10 percent decrease in treatment and disposal revenue. As Jeff mentioned, the primary contributor to the decline in our treatment and disposal revenue was a 15 percent decline in base business, partially offset by an eight percent increase in event business in the third quarter of Twenty twenty compared to the third quarter last year. Legacy USA Ecology Field Industrial Services Revenue was forty nine point nine dollars million in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, up 10 percent, driven primarily by higher revenues in our small quantity generation emergency response and total waste management waste management business lines partially offset by lower revenues in our industrial services and transportation and logistics service lines. Gross margin for the legacy U.S. college business was thirty one percent in the third quarter, down from 34 percent in the third quarter last year. Our environmental services segment, Treatment and Disposal Margin was 43 percent in the third quarter of Twenty twenty treatment and disposal margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 44 percent after backing out two point six dollars million in business interruption insurance recoveries related to prior periods.
[00:18:12] Gross margin for the Legacy USA Ecology Film Industrial Services segment was 16 percent in both the third quarters of Twenty twenty and 2019. DNA for the legacy USC college business was twenty nine point five dollars million, compared to thirty three point three dollars million last year, excluding business development expenses and a property insurance recovery in the third quarter of 2019, as GenÃ© was twenty eight point nine dollars million in the third quarter of twenty twenty, down from twenty nine point eight dollars million in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Lagus USC College's adjusted EBITDA was down fourteen percent to thirty five point seven dollars million for the third quarter of twenty twenty, compared to forty one point five dollars million in the third quarter last year. Looking at the first nine months of twenty twenty four legacy, your psychology on slide 12 revenue is four hundred and fifty four point eight dollars million, up slightly from four hundred and fifty four point two dollars million in the first months of the first nine months of 2019. This is driven by six percent growth in our field and industrial services segment, partially offset by a two percent decline in our environmental services segment compared to the first nine months of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for legacy, US ecology was one hundred point one dollars million for the first nine months of 2020, down from one hundred and three point one dollars million for the first nine months of last year.
[00:19:37] Turning to slide 13, we exited the quarter with a solid balance sheet and strong liquidity. We had cash on hand of one hundred and two million dollars and net borrowings of seven hundred twenty four point six dollars million at September 30th, Twenty twenty, which was an improvement over our net borrowings at both December 31st, 2019 and June 30th, Twenty twenty, our operating cash flow increased to eighty three point two dollars million in the first nine months of twenty twenty, up 30 percent from sixty four dollars million in the first nine months of 2019, which drove our adjusted free cash flows up 50 percent to fifty one point five dollars million, compared to thirty four point two dollars million in the first nine months of twenty nineteen. Looking at our overall debt position at September 30th, Twenty twenty, we had just over one hundred million dollars of available capacity on a revolving line of credit after paying down 30 million dollars in the third quarter of Twenty twenty, in addition to one hundred and two million dollars of cash on hand. Our debt is structured such that there are low required payments in our term loan B facility, which does not mature until twenty twenty six. This structure gives us ample flexibility at a cost that is averaging approximately three percent in cash interest. The leverage ratio under our revolving credit facility was four times at September 30th, twenty twenty well under the five point twenty five times covenant level for the quarter. Overall, our solid liquidity and strong balance sheet allow us to continue to operate the business with a long term focus and position is for a strong exit from the pandemic and related market conditions. With that, I'll turn the call back to Jeff. Thanks, Eric.
[00:21:19] Moving to our Outlook slide on Slide 14, despite the ongoing and challenging conditions we are all facing, we expect continued improvement as we look to capitalize on the economic recovery. Though uncertainty remains, we are reestablishing our business outlook for Twenty twenty that was withdrawn earlier this year. We are continuing to see data that gives us confidence that better times are ahead of us. First, our services based business led the way in the third quarter with strong growth. We believe a service based recovery is the first indication of business condition improvement. Further supporting this, industrial production metrics have continued to strengthen through October and are now at levels we have not seen for many years. This is encouraging and makes us optimistic. We will see improving base business conditions in the coming months as we naturally lag production in the waste side of the business, even our energy mix.Those businesses are seeing slivers of life with additional investment returning.
[00:22:21] As we continue with the recovery, we remain prudent with cost controls and deployment of capital. We continue to limit non sales related travel and other discretionary spending, although we have resumed hiring, particularly in operations and within our services based business. Capital spending is expected to come in between 60 to 64 million dollars, down from the initial range of 90 to 95 million dollars. We had set out in February all in. We expect that our Twenty twenty full, full year performance to produce total revenue between nine hundred and eleven million and nine hundred and thirty one million dollars adjusted EBITDA between 168 million and 175 million dollars, which translates into fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA between forty one million and forty eight million dollars. Free cash flow should end the year between 61 million to 65 million dollars, up 29 percent at the low end of the range from 2000 levels. And adjusted EPS should range between 36 cents to 50 cents per share. The obvious risks to our guidance would include a new round of shut downs like we experienced in April and the inherent risk that event business timing slips into 2021. I am so very proud of the entire U.S. technology team as we work together across regions and service lines, further integrating our businesses while ensuring the safety of our people and meeting the needs of our customers. Today, we are in excellent shape to navigate these challenging times and create a sustainable future for us. Ecology's team members and stockholders ready to capitalize on opportunities for growth as industrial economies continue to recover. With that operator, can you open up the call for questions?\
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[00:24:16] Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question. You may press star, then one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question, please. Press star then to. At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Michael Hoffman
[00:24:45] Thank you, Jeff, Eric, and team hope everybody swell out there as well. When we think about the base business. Where did September and relative to the whole quarter and service, or how is it setting us up for four? And when you think about volume changes and you look at the customer base, you know, is where the volume trends consistent with the improving industrial production activity.
Jeff Feeler
[00:25:26] Yes, so, Michael, on that, let's just kind of talk holistically about about face business. So in the third quarter, it was a little choppy. It started out actually pretty improved in July, got soft in August and rebounded in September. When you kind of look at our industrial customer base, you know, I know that a lot of our customers, which I call it retooling, but they were trying to get to a new, you know, working environment with their with their teams and processing. And they were processing it lower than than full capacity levels. And so that kind of translated in when you looked at base business, you know, kind of throughout our whole network where we ended up seeing softness, no surprise was in the Midwest as autos started to recover in the late second quarter and into the third quarter and didn't really probably hit full stride towards the end. And the related businesses around that the Gulf Coast also saw saw, you know, some some challenging conditions on the back side. And a lot of that is due to, you know, the activity level down there as we do a lot of work with refineries which are heavily populated down there. And it's it's not just upstream energy that's being impacted. It's the full chain. And so we've seen we've seen those customers producing less volumes. They've also been entrenched, entrenched with their own capital preservation initiatives along the way. And so that has created some additional softness during the quarter. As we look kind of forward view, I would expect that we would see improving conditions sequentially on base business as more waste flow starts, starts flowing through the network. We are seeing a lot more improvement in our in our end markets across across the board. And as we move into 2021, I would imagine that we'll even see some of the the more challenging sectors starting to resume, some spending and investment in those areas. And so that's kind of how we think of the base business right now moving forward.
Eric Gerratt
[00:27:28] The other thing that the other thing I'd add, Michael, just as a reminder as is, you know, that lag that we typically experience in our business in terms of when the waist shows up, you know, when you see the upticks and HSM and production, which are great and they're good indicators. And if you look over history where we're about a two quarter or from that, I think this cycle, what's unique is, you know, things dropped off much faster than they have in other cycles for obvious reasons. But I think we're still kind of in that lag period before we'll start to see those volumes really start to pick up along with the the trends you see in Islam.
Michael Hoffman
[00:28:04] Ok, fair enough. And I'm not asking for guidance for 21, but do you have a sense of how we should think about cadence if based on the patterns you're seeing as we look into 2001? What's the pattern through the year?
Jeff Feeler
[00:28:21] Yeah, you're if you're talking a year over year, you know, we're we're we had a couple of really strong quarters in Q4 of 19 in Q4, of our not Q4, Q1 of twenty. So I would imagine we'll still be in a negative environment for the next couple of quarters. And then as we cycle, you know, the first round of covid shutdowns, we'll start seeing incremental improvement. As far as as far as sequential performance, you know, really, it's too early to tell on how that's going to be. I do expect some improving conditions sequentially with natural seasonality in our base business.
Michael Hoffman
[00:29:02] Okay. The strength of field industrial services, when you pull out and you looked at the legacy, you were flat margins. But but I have to believe that there's a mix issue there, too, that getting incrementally favorable over time. And then you get to add in the benefit of NRC and and what those businesses bring. I mean, on the field industrial side, they're actually better margin, I think, than your legacy business.
Eric Gerratt
[00:29:34] Yes, that's correct, Michael, and you're right, as you as you look at consolidated margin, gross margin, you see that 19 percent versus 16 percent last year. And then you look at legacy U.S. ecology and it was 16 percent, both so pretty flattish. But so the NRC businesses will. And as we integrate and we're seeing more and more traction on this being upwards in the FISA margins, because it is tends to be higher margin business on the legacy U.S. ecology side, I still feel really good about where we're heading. We saw another really strong quarter in Enescu, particularly on the retail side. So retail was up over 50 percent in Q3 this year versus last year. So we continue to see a good trend there. Emergency response business on the legacy or psychology side has also been up, some of which or a portion of which is the covid deacon work that we're doing through the legacy or psychology facilities. But overall, I think our margin profile within our city and even in the legacy or psychology business continues to improve and grow.
Michael Hoffman
[00:30:41] Ok, and so to that end, on the demand side, what are what are we thinking about as far as the headwind of that comparability and a perfect scenario, you don't want to be doing any deals because we've gotten back to sort of life is normal, but maybe there's going to be some recurring. But how do we think about what that headwind is going into 21?
Jeff Feeler
[00:31:06] Yeah, Steve, do you want to give that a shot and I'll supplement?
Steve Welling
[00:31:10] Well, right at the moment we're continuing actually it's been increasing a bit over the last few weeks. I don't exactly know where we're going to be next year, but at the same time that we're doing, you know, the covid work, as things recover, we'll be doing additional hazmat type work to be more trucks on the road and, you know, more activities going forward. But the other area that we expect would come to the into the mix, as we've been mostly working at retail stores and places that have been opened, things like colleges and universities have not been open. And we expect there to be some additional new new work on the cold front as things reopen there. So that's just speculation a lot of ways because we don't know for sure.
Michael Hoffman
[00:31:57] And then do we have a dollar amount that we're talking about?
Eric Gerratt
[00:32:02] So we've done roughly 18 million dollars a year to date or through the third quarter on covid work, over 3000 responses, and it's been better clip over the last six or six weeks than that. So I don't know. You know, it just depends, Michael. I mean, I don't think anybody can tell you what's going to happen with the person next year for sure. If it stays the way it's been, then we'll continue doing covid cleaning's something changes that will obviously change that market. Right.
Michael Hoffman
[00:32:35] And you broke up when you said Dollar Man, did you say 18 million, 19 million, 19.
Eric Gerratt
[00:32:40] Ok, thank you.
Jeff Feeler
[00:32:41] Through September, Michael, we're just over 19 million dollars of revenue on almost 3000 projects.
Michael Hoffman
[00:32:47] Got it. Got it. And then again, not looking for a hard guidance, but is the sense that Twenty twenty one becomes your groundhog, your ear, and basically you repeat twenty twenty guidance sort of that that's sort of the underlying gut of where this is settling out.
Jeff Feeler
[00:33:09] Well, I we're not really prepared to talk about 21 right now, we're still going through our through our budgeting activities, Michael. If I understood your question right on Groundhog is, are we expected to be delivering the same guidance for 21 that we did in February of twenty? Yeah, I don't see that happening for for this next year. I think that we're going to be dealing with this pandemic into 21, you know, probably for the at least the first half of one, if not longer. And I still think there's too much uncertainty to give a guidance range on that. But but to say that we're going to be a free covid levels with still the headwinds and energy level are in the energy sector. I don't see that as a as a plausible scenario.
Michael Hoffman
[00:34:04] Ok, yeah, I had to get a Bill Murray context in here somehow. Thanks.
Jeff Feeler
[00:34:10] Thanks, Michael.
Operator
[00:34:13] Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Tyler Brown 
[00:34:18] Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Jeff. So I appreciate the guidance, but I was hoping to maybe break apart the EBITDA into the key buckets. So at a high level, how do we kind of deconstruct that low 170 midpoint? Is it something like zero in our energy, maybe something like 30 and NRC call it non energy and then maybe, you know, 40, 45, 100, 140 to 145 million in legacy ecologies or something like that, just broadly.
Jeff Feeler
[00:34:54] Yeah, Tyler, so the energy waste piece. Yes, we're assuming that that's going to be breakeven ish from an EBITDA perspective for the full year. So so that's that's that piece on the nasty side. Yeah, I think I think your numbers in the right range. USC, Caulkins. So I think I think you're in the right ballpark. OK. Yeah. I was just looking for broad ballpark. That's helpful.
Tyler Brown 
[00:35:20] And so I think, Jeff, you mentioned something a little bit about non energy waste streams. Can you just talk about what those streams might be? Are those are those energy landfill's permitted for different types of waste or what what kinds of waste might those be?
Jeff Feeler
[00:35:36] Yeah, so the landfills that we take primarily to drilling waste, I mean, that was the core market. But they also took remediation waste from I'll call it closure pad's closure pads, things like that spills accidents. While we're not necessarily seeing the spills and accidents to the same level, but they do happen. But there's a lot more remediation of pits as the wellheads are getting closed down under the regulatory framework. And so that is where we're seeing some incremental volume coming in right now. And to be honest with you, that's kind of where some of the core companies, incompetencies of US ecology comes in because we're always competing for that business along the way. And so this is very similar to event business and we can structure it and be more more laser focused on it. And so that's what our teams are working on today. We've been seeing that coming through in the third quarter. They're coming through in the fourth quarter. I imagine this will still continue to be a bigger part of our business going forward until the drilling starts to return.
Tyler Brown 
[00:36:38] Ok, OK, that's that's interesting. Helpful. And then I may I may have missed it, but what is the general expectation for events in Q4? Because you talked about it being potentially, you know, slip into twenty one. But what is kind of in the implicit guide I suppose.
Jeff Feeler
[00:36:56] Yeah, so sequentially, I would expect event business to be down. And the reason for that is twofold is, one, just the natural cycle of coming through kind of the summer construction process. We also had a couple of a couple larger accounts that are going into their their slower phases. But we have seen and in fact, in our guidance right now, we have seen several projects shift to Twenty twenty one, and they are predominantly due to covid related activities. They're not canceled. They're still going they're going to move next year on that. And so that's just a normal risk in our business. And, you know, we're sitting here on November 6th and, you know, there's there's really eight weeks or a little bit less than that of the of the year. So if there is any weather delays and any shifting any any of that stuff that could that could that can materially change the guidance based on how how strongly that business has been.
Tyler Brown 
[00:37:59] Ok, OK, that's helpful. And then so Eric, on Slide 18, I really appreciate the slide on the covenants. So if I just kind of roll the implied, you know, Q4, it seems like trailing 12 EBITDA, that's pretty consistent. So are you kind of expecting that your debt ratios are maybe either at or close to peak? I mean, obviously, we don't know what's going to happen next year. Something crazy could happen, but is that kind of the base expectation, at least right now?
Jeff Feeler
[00:38:28] Yeah, I'd say that's that's the expectation right now. The struggle and typically, if you look seasonally, you know, Q1 is one of our our we have a bit of a drag sometimes and in working capital, Q4, Q1, depending on how the year goes. So that might have some impact. But I think for Q4, I think from a leverage perspective, will probably be about where we were for Q3, maybe up a tick, and then Q1 probably similarly. And then I would again, assuming things go the way we expect that we start to then trend back down. Right. Right.
Tyler Brown 
[00:39:07] Ok, and then just a couple of quick questions on cash flow and capital allocation. But how should we think about you know, I know you're obviously not giving much guidance on 21, but one thing is somewhat in your control is CapEx. So does it feel that that's going to jump back to call it pretty covid type levels, call it at 90 million dollar range? If I had if I was looking at my notes, it seemed like 21 was going to be a higher U.S. ecology legacy year on cell development anyway. And then it was going to drop down in 2002. But I'm just kind of curious. Any just initial thoughts on CapEx next year?
Jeff Feeler
[00:39:47] Yeah, so that's a good question. So right now, what we're planning for is, you know, we see the road to recovery with normal economic cycle and we've gotten more confidence around that, given that we've lived with this pandemic for the last eight months. And I think that that's why we reestablish guidance. So when we start looking at where we're at, what cushion we have on our our covenants, you know, we know the business level should be up next year at some level, I would imagine that we will return to around that 90 million dollar ish range of capital. You are right. There is a lot of that that's tied to cell development and landfill construction, and that's critical. We need to do that. Some of the spend is part of a multi-year effort that actually may carry over into Twenty twenty to add. Are our large Michigan based landfill very difficult construction there. So I imagine that will be around that 90 million next year on there. But it also depends it really depends on how we're seeing the overall outlook for 2021 at this stage. And we will adjust accordingly on that. We will never, never skimp on the landfill side of things. We cannot run out of space. We got to keep those up and operational. So.
Tyler Brown 
[00:41:08] Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And then just my last one and this is a little bit broader question about just capital allocation, but. Number one, do you intend to reinstate the dividend, and if so, what do you need to see a number to? Where should we think about free cash flow being allocated over the next few years? You do you anticipate it just kind of getting swept to pay down debt? Do you see acquisitions? Just any broad thoughts there I think would be helpful.
Jeff Feeler
[00:41:37] Yeah. So very, very good question. So the crystal ball I'm looking through right now, which is murky at best, is we do intend to reinstate the dividend, but facts and circumstances will determine whether we reinstated dividend or go to some other capital return of capital shareholders, share buybacks, things like that. But that's our intention. It's really dependent on when we when we're comfortable operating in our covenant level that will get adjusted in Twenty twenty to back down. So those are factors that come in. If we if we get back to pro pre covid levels of cash flow expectations, you know, are we will continue to pay down debt, that we would then start looking at potential acquisition opportunities and that we will continue to always invest organically in ourselves. We take advantage of that every single year and we're still doing that. We did it this year, even under the capital constrained conditions that we've done. We're looking at a lot of great things next year that are planning to use up some capital and you know, where we try to try to get a lot of mileage out of as our maintenance side. And so if we can if we can get some more duration on the maintenance side and get by and reinvest that in growth opportunities, that's what we try to accomplish.
Tyler Brown 
[00:42:57] Ok, well, thank you, very generous with your time, thanks.
Jeff Feeler
[00:43:00] All right, thanks.
Operator
[00:43:03] As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one, our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Silber
[00:43:16] Thanks so much. I just got a couple of quick ones, hopefully in your prepared comments, you talked about potentially the energy waste side of the business finding a bottom. I'm just curious what makes you confident to make that statement? What do you see?
Jeff Feeler
[00:43:32] Well, we're actually seeing despite despite the sequential decline through the quarter, we saw improvement, we saw opportunities with remediation investments that were occurring that were creating volume. And then when you just start talking to looking at what our customers are doing, although it's very small in numbers, we are starting to see rigs and activity returning to the market. If you listen to some of the larger players that continue to consolidate down and what their plans are for next year, even know that they are restricting overall capital, the areas in which we operate in, they continue to be bullish in and they continue there. They are continuing and have indicated that they plan to make investments in there. And so that's why I think we've found bottom on that. The fact is, is we'll see how it all translates into the overall oil markets in the coming months and quarters.
Jeff Silber
[00:44:33] Ok, that's helpful, and you talk a little bit about some of the geographic areas, you know, in terms of trends there. You mentioned the Gulf Coast. I think you have more exposure in Texas, then Louisiana, if I remember correctly. But I'm just curious, have you been impacted by the hurricanes at all, either positively or negatively?
Jeff Feeler
[00:44:52] Yeah, well, you know, fortunately, our facilities and our people have not been materially impacted by the hurricanes. And that's been a blessing for us ecology on that as far as business goes. There has been some incremental business on emergency response, but it hasn't been a needle mover. I think that a couple of the hurricanes that went up through Louisiana, you know, we we saw some incremental volume on on it, but there hasn't been a needle mover there from that perspective. But those do happen from time to time.
Eric Gerratt
[00:45:25] It came that most of our work we did hurricane was over in Florida do Sally.
Jeff Silber
[00:45:32] Yes, kind of forgot about that. There's been so much else going on since then, but I appreciate that. All right. Thanks so much for the call. All right. Thanks, Jeff.
