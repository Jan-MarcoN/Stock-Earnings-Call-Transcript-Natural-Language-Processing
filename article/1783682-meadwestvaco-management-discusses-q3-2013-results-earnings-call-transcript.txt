Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MeadWestvaco Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Carrie, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Jim Buzzard and Mark Rajkowski are here to talk about our third quarter results as well as a strategic transaction we announced yesterday afternoon. The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and is being webcast at mwv.com where the slides are also available. Our result and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct, as of today, but could include time-sensitive information and are subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.
John A. Luke
Thanks, Jason, and good morning. We have a number of positive developments to discuss with you this morning. We had higher sales and renewed earnings growth during the third quarter, including continued signs that our profitable growth strategy is working and our execution is improving, even as economic conditions soften around the world. We'll get to that in a moment, as I plan to moderate between commentary from both Jim and Mark on the quarter. But first, I'd like to offer a few comments about the agreement with Plum Creek that we announced yesterday afternoon, and then turn to Mark for some additional details on the transaction.
The agreement we've signed with Plum Creek fulfills all of the strategic objectives we set for a transaction involving our forestland and real estate development business. As we reported in yesterday's press release, we're selling our U.S. forestland and creating a new partnership focused on real estate development in the Charleston, South Carolina region. The total implied value of the transaction is $1.5 billion. We'll receive consideration of approximately $1.1 billion when we closed the deal by the end of this year, and we're evaluating the best options for returning most of the value directly to shareholders.
Plum Creek is the ideal partner for this unique transaction. Our landholdings fit well in their portfolio and we know that they share our commitment to sustainable development. This will enable us to build an ongoing strategic relationship around our Charleston development activities and long-term fiber supply agreements for our Covington paperboard mill in Virginia.
When we announced our intention to evaluate options for this business, we laid out several important strategic objectives. And as I said, we have fulfilled them all. First, we've generated maximum value from these assets. The timing is right for the market, the partner is right for the company, the outcome is right for our shareholders. Second, we've preserved as much value as possible by keeping tax efficiency very much in mind. Compared to all of the available options, this transaction minimizes our exposure and immediately delivers significant value to our shareholders. Third, our shareholders will continue to participate in a very attractive upside potential of our well-located development properties in South Carolina, especially the Nexton and East Edisto projects. Ken Seeger and his team have already put the strategies in place for these developments and they will continue to lead the implementation with the backing of the MWV brand in the community. Plum Creek shares our confidence in both our team and development plans, and we look forward to working with them to further the significant opportunities that we have in Charleston.
Looking ahead, MWV will be even more focused on our core Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses. This transaction represents another important step in our deliberate and strategic transformation placing an even greater focus on our participation in the large, growing global Packaging and Specialty Chemicals markets, where we continue to make very good progress
I'll have a few more comments as part of our report on the third quarter, but first, I want to ask Mark to share some of the financial elements and other details of the Plum Creek transaction. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, John. Obviously, we're very excited about this deal. It's a great outcome for our company and for our shareholders. I'll begin by highlighting a few key items, including value creation, use of proceeds and timing.
The $1.5 billion of implied value from this transaction is very attractive. And we've structured this deal to provide significant tax efficiencies and also to preserve substantial upside potential for our shareholders, as we execute our plans under our new real estate development partnership. This value is higher than the base case valuation we laid out for investors in Charleston a few years ago. Taking into consideration that we've already realized nearly a quarter billion dollars from land sales in the interim and that we're also retaining certain oil and gas rights in West Virginia and a majority of the upside potential in our Charleston development properties.
As John noted, this transaction will deliver approximately $1.1 billion in consideration to MWV and importantly, preserves almost $150 million of value through tax efficient structures. Taking a closer look at what's included in the agreement, Plum Creek is paying $934 million for 501,000 acres of forestland and some mineral rights or $1,864 per acre. In addition to the U.S. forestland acquisition, Plum Creek will invest in the newly formed partnership comprised of MWV's approximately 109,000 acres of diversified development lands in the Charleston, South Carolina region. Plum Creek will acquire for $152 million in cash, an ownership interest in the partnership, placing an initial implied value of the partnership at approximately $530 million. This attractive valuation reflects the outstanding job Ken Seeger's team has done over the last 6 years to grow the value of these well positioned properties. However, we shared the view with Plum Creek that there is tremendous upside potential in the Charleston region, so we expect to create even more value through this partnership over time. Not included in the agreement are the oil and gas rights on the 191,000 acres located over the Marcellus Shale fairway in West Virginia.
Given current market pricing for natural gas, valuations for these rights today are low by historical standards and, therefore, selling them now would not be in the best interest of our shareholders. We will continue to work with Bluescape to quantify the gas reserves and of course, we'll periodically evaluate the market for the appropriate opportunity to maximize shareholder value with this asset. We expect to close by the end of this year, at which time, we're estimating we'll have $950 million in net proceeds after taxes and fees. We plan to use about $210 million to pay down the balance on our term loan to ensure we maintain our investment grade rating.
We'll also use approximately $75 million from the proceeds to fund a new real estate development partnership, which will largely cover the cash needs of the business, until it becomes cash flow positive in 2016. The remaining $665 million of proceeds will be returned to shareholders. With our board and advisors, we'll consider all of our options in optimizing returns for shareholders and we'll make a determination at closing, or sometime shortly thereafter. Furthermore, despite the loss of cash flow from the sale of rural and recreation lands, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate of $0.25 per share.
That concludes our comments on the transaction and I'll now turn it back to John to kick off our discussion about the third quarter. John?
John A. Luke
Thanks, Mark, and thanks, again, for your leadership in enabling this important transaction. Again, we're pleased with this agreement. It accomplishes all of the objectives we set out at the beginning of this year and it enables us to further focus on accelerating our profitable growth strategy in Packaging and Specialty Chemicals.
We made good progress in these areas during the third quarter, as well as with other initiatives we've had underway to improve our earnings performance. In terms of our commercial excellence and innovation efforts in both the developed and emerging markets we serve around the world, we're outperforming the broader food and beverage markets with the special value propositions of our high-quality paperboard and we're winning positions with the best positioned brand owners in each industry.
We're gaining market share in medical plastics, skincare, fragrance and other beauty dispensing categories and we're continuing to accelerate the pace of change in the adherence packaging market for health care.
We're generating higher prices for our corrugated solutions in Brazil and seeing gains with our new operations in India, despite reduced GDP expectations in both countries. In both of these markets, we're pursuing a steady move toward higher quality corrugated packaging for fresh produce, frozen meat and household goods. And we're continuing to excel in megatrend specialty chemicals markets, including our innovative solutions for automotive emission controls, road paving and energy exploration.
In addition to this commercial momentum, we also improved our overall operating performance in the third quarter, which had not been up to our standards during the first half of the year. Our productivity improved significantly, and we consistently expanded the quality and capacity of our new paperboard machines in both Brazil and India. We also began the process of bringing our new biomass boiler at Covington online. This will have a positive impact on the bottom line during the fourth quarter. This is the strategic path we've laid out: differentiated participation in our markets, disciplined focus on execution and sound growth investments. Even with the challenging global economic conditions, we expect to further improve our performance in Packaging and Specialty Chemicals as well as close the transaction with Plum Creek as we move through the fourth quarter.
Now I'd like to turn to Jim for a rundown of the performance in each of our segments. Jim?
James A. Buzzard
Thank you, John. Overall, our operational performance improved in the third quarter and contributed to better earnings, especially compared to the first half of this year. Even as macroeconomic conditions have negatively impacted overall demand in similar markets, we are continuing to outperform with our participation strategies and increasingly benefiting from the growth and productivity investments we've made through the downturn. We expect to build on this commercial and operational momentum through the end of the year and deliver meaningful profitable growth in the fourth quarter and into 2014.
I'll provide a quick overview of each of our segments, with the reminder that detailed information about each business is contained in the slides that accompany this call. In Food & Beverage, we have overcome the operational issues from the second quarter and are running at expected levels with strong backlogs at this point in the fourth quarter. And while overall volumes and pricing were down in the quarter, sequential volume trends and price realizations are both positive.
Looking at the 2 big markets we serve in this business, we are generally outperforming broader industry trends in both food and beverage with our unique paperboard value propositions and commercial excellent efforts. Our food volumes are up strongly year-over-year compared to a flattish market as we continue to win share with brand owners choosing to replace corrugated and coated recycled board with our innovative lightweight paperboard. And in beverage, our integrated system approach with the leading brand owners, has led to better than market performance in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
In North America, we're essentially flat in a market that is down for both carbonated soft drinks and canned beer. In Europe, we grew 4% as the market bounced back from poor conditions earlier this year. And in Asia, we continued our strong growth as we partner with our customers to help shape the development of the multi-pack market. And more carton volumes are flowing through the packaging machines we placed with key customers over the past few years.
Given our momentum in these targeted markets, we expect solid earnings improvement in the fourth quarter driven by volume gains, better pricing and improved manufacturing productivity. Including expected benefits from the new Covington boiler and our paper machine rebuild at Mahrt.
In Home, Health & Beauty, we are continuing to win market share in the parts of the business we're emphasizing going forward, namely, our plastic pumps and dispensers. Total sales were basically flat in the quarter and earnings were impacted by high resin prices as well as transitory costs associated with the move from folding cartons to plastic dispensers in Brazil.
Looking at the 3 primary markets we serve in this business, our beauty and personal care dispensing volumes were up more than 10% in the quarter. We're gaining market share in several categories, especially with our fragrance solutions in Europe, as we just launched another line extension of our popular Melodie spray collection.
We've had very strong volume growth, over 20% in our preservative-free nasal pumps in health care. This is high margin business and we are midway through an expansion of our facility in Germany to serve the growing medical plastics market. We're also continuing to add new branded prescription drugs to our core adherence packaging business with large retailers.
The home and garden market has been very tough this year with weather and other impacts on the category, and we were essentially flat during the seasonally weak third quarter. We were proud to see our customer Simple Green featured on the cover of Packaging Digest, with our new VersaPlast Trigger Sprayer, which is a key part of our growth strategy in North America.
In the fourth quarter, we expect a modest profit versus last year's breakeven performance. Volume and pricing gains in targeted segments of the personal care, home and garden and health care markets will be partially offset by higher raw material costs, mainly resin, and transitory costs related to the exit of our Folding Carton business. Given our pipeline of brand launches, innovative new products and our broader emerging market focus, we are confident that performance will improve significantly in 2014.
Turning to our Industrial Packaging business, we continued to ramp toward full production and commercialization of the growth investments, product enhancements and quality improvements we've made in our corrugated business, in both Brazil and India.
While we are not yet fully optimized in Brazil, we began to see the expected sales in earnings improvement in the third quarter as the new machine reached target production rates for the first time in September. We expect to continue building on these rates in the fourth quarter and through 2014.
Looking specifically at our business in each of these 2 geographies. In Brazil, overall economic growth continued at a slow pace and corrugated packaging demand was tepid in the quarter. We focused on protecting our margins, successfully raising prices to offset wage and material inflation. As expected, we lost some box volume due to these price increases, as well as from the sale of our Feira de Santana box plant. But we expect to win some of the business back as customers assimilate to higher prices and appreciate our quality and service compared with the competition. The paperboard markets are showing excellent receptivity for the lightweight container board from our new machine, and this is nicely offsetting the corrugated market softness.
In India, we are ramping up the new paper machine and starting conversations with customers and box users to help lead the market toward adoption of higher-quality corrugated packaging. We see significant opportunity to help transition the market to value performance-based packaging, which our business is well suited to provide.
In the fourth quarter, we expect a significant dollar-based earnings growth in the Industrial segment. On a local currency basis, we expect to more than double last year's profit in Brazil with modest corrugated volume growth and continued pricing gains, as well as productivity improvement at our expanded Tres Barras mill. Earnings in India are expected to be neutral to segment earnings as we continue to ramp up that business.
In Specialty Chemicals, sales and earnings both increased compared to last year's record quarter. There were some one-off benefits that offset a competitive market for some of our standard pine chemicals products. These pressures are stabilized and our momentum in this business continues to be very strong. We benefited from the acquisition of the Resitec pine chemicals business in Brazil and continue to solidify and extend our positions in the automotive carbon, asphalt paving, energy exploration and adhesives markets. In particular, our warm mix asphalt additive, Evotherm, performed very well in the third quarter even as government spending on infrastructure has been declining around the world. Also, new vehicle sales in the U.S., a key driver of our carbon business, continued to strengthen and next year, are estimated to reach a level not seen since 2006.
In the fourth quarter, we expect solid earnings growth in Specialty Chemicals. We expect the sequential pricing trends for our standard, pine chemicals products to stabilize or improve, but there will still be a very difficult comparison to last year.
We also expect continued volume gains in asphalt, adhesives, oilfield and automotive markets as well as improved productivity. However, a recent production interruption of our Charleston facility will partially offset these gains by about $2 million to $3 million.
I'm not going to talk much about Community Development and Land Management. The story there is, obviously, the transaction with Plum Creek. However, CDLM did have a very strong performance with land sales during the third quarter, which was a significant driver of the overall company's sales and earnings improvement.
Now I'll turn over to Mark for his comments on the financial performance during the third quarter. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Jim. I'll quickly cover our third quarter financial results and then provide our outlook for the fourth quarter.
Despite continued macroeconomic challenges and emerging market volatility, we feel good about our sales progress, renewed earnings growth and the solid cash performance for the quarter. We expect to continue this trajectory through the current quarter and into 2014.
Sales increased 3% in the quarter, largely due to the addition of Ruby Macons and Resitec businesses, higher land sales and improved pricing and mix, particularly in the Industrial business in Brazil. The higher pricing and lower overall consumption in Brazil had a negative impact on corrugated volumes, which we expected. Our total packaging volumes were also down during the quarter, with gains in retail food, aseptic packaging and personal care dispensers more than offset by the timing of some tobacco shipments and lower food service volumes as we continue to ramp up a new solution with a major customer. Unfavorable foreign exchange, primarily in Brazil, also reduced sales by about 1% during the quarter.
Adjusted EBIT increased 25% to $179 million. Higher land sales and pension income accounted for a large portion of the year-over-year earnings growth in the quarter. However, much improved operational execution during the quarter, resulted in better manufacturing productivity at all our facilities. This, along with continued reductions in overhead costs, helped offset the impacts of higher input costs and wage inflation, as well as lower volume absorption during the quarter.
We generated approximately $12 million in additional overhead savings during the third quarter, which brings our total for the year to $28 million and puts us in a position to deliver above our expected range of $25 million to $30 million of savings for 2013. These savings have also contributed to reducing SG&A as a percentage of sales by 60 basis points in the quarter.
Cash flow from operations improved to $148 million in the third quarter. This brings our cash flow from operations to $260 million year-to-date, which is double the year ago amount of $127 million. We expect to finish the year with positive free cash flow, excluding the major capital investments of about $200 million.
Our cash on hand has declined approximately $200 million since the beginning of the year largely reflecting the investments in our large capital projects, primarily the Covington biomass boiler, which successfully started up this month.
We expect to be within our anticipated range for CapEx this year, roughly $500 million to $525 million, and our current view of 2014 CapEx remains $375 million to $400 million.
Now I'll turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect significant earnings improvement versus the prior year in each of our manufacturing segments, largely driven by productivity gains and lower overhead costs. We also expect higher overall volume and improved price mix in our Targeted Packaging and Specialty Chemicals end markets. With the expected close of the Plum Creek transaction in the current year, we will report fourth quarter results from CDLM's forestry and rural land activities, as discontinued operations. As a result, we expect a small loss related to development activities in the fourth quarter.
Looking to 2014. Our forecasted full year EBITDA for CDLM was approximately $90 million. The loss of CDLM's earnings impacts our ability to achieve a $1.2 billion EBITDA goal we set at the end of 2011. In addition, we've experienced significant unfavorable currency translations and sluggish growth in our markets since 2011. We expect these trends to continue through next year. As a result, we're adjusting our outlook for EBITDA performance in 2014 to a range of $950 million to $1 billion.
Now I'll turn it back to John.
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks very much. We've covered a lot today, with major focus on the news about our forestland and real estate business. As we move toward closing the transaction at Plum Creek and continuing to improve the performance of our Packaging and Specialty Chemicals businesses, we're creating significant value for our shareholders.
Our growth strategies are working and our operating performance has improved and stabilized. Good signs for a significant improvement in earnings and cash flow during the fourth quarter, solid momentum heading into next year.
This concludes the remarks we had prepared for review with you this morning and we'd now be happy to answer your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So just starting there, I just wanted to delve into a little bit kind of what's left. Obviously, you talked about some of the costs you're going to be incurring in that business to achieve the future upside you see there. Can you talk about how you see that kind of monetization layering in, over time, given that you don't expect to be cash flow positive until 2016? Do you expect that, essentially, you're not going to kind of monetize anything until that point or are there kind of mile markers you might be able to achieve between now and then?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Phil, yes, let me take that one. We do expect to generate cash flows from a number of different transactions over the next couple of years. So we will be -- we expect to be selling some properties at good value but we'll also be continuing to make some investments in the development projects that we have, particularly in our one JV, that is more near in development, includes Nexton as well as a couple of number of other projects. So we're still in the, I would say, the earlier stages of the development process, but expect to be monetizing certain properties along the way.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Got it, okay. And then on industrial, my question there is if I look at last year's bridge, you had about $6 million of headwinds from the projects. So if I think about this year's third quarter, as we lapped that $6 million in cost, I guess I would have expected the net productivity to kind of have, at least, that add back and then potentially, the kicking in of some of the savings. It sounds like you're kind of hitting the full run rate towards the end of the quarter but maybe could you just help me understand kind of what's driving that continued headwind relative to last year's comps?
John A. Luke
Jim, you want to take that up?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Phil. We do have a variety of things going on. As you noted, we did reach the targeted production levels in September of this last quarter. So the team has made tremendous progress through the course of this year and we're optimistic, not only about having reached the targeted levels but the opportunity we see to go beyond those levels as we go forward. So really good results from the team. In terms of some of the things that impacted us during the quarter, we had a significant maintenance outage, which we didn't really outlook to you, but that represented probably $3 million to $3.5 million just in maintenance and services costs. In addition, we lost the absorption and other things from the downtime related to that, normal sort of maintenance. We're also taking advantage to fix some of the things that we've identified through the course of the ramp-up and put all those together and took the mill down to take care of that. We also had some FX that hit us and then, we have seen some cost pressure in areas like OCC and others. But the real key for us going forward is now that we've got to the target levels, now it's beating the optimization and we've got a great team down there. As I said, we have a lot of confidence in what that product is going to deliver for us. And so we're very optimistic as we look to Q4 in 2014 in Brazil.
Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Mark, last question just as, as with the guidance on 2014, how do you think about the productivity across the businesses that layer in to help you reach that target. Anyway you could quantify those far us?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Well, yes, Phil. I recall we did have some challenges that we had to work through the first half of this year. So there's going to be substantial snapback from that. Certainly, we're going to see significant benefits, as Jim just mentioned, now that we've achieved that targeted capacity in September. We're going to go from there, continue to ramp that up so there'll be substantial operating productivity that we'll see in Brazil. So -- and we've also got benefits from our investment in the Covington boiler. And importantly, we're continuing to make great progress on taking out overhead costs. So that's going to be a fairly substantial contributor to our next year's earnings growth.
James A. Buzzard
And the only thing I might add, Phil, is, I think, as we noted, we had a big rebuild at our Mahrt mill. Team did a great job coming up from that outage and we see some benefits with the new products coming out of there in 2014 as well. So as Mark said, good opportunity from both snapback, as well as our investments in ongoing operating excellence to drive productivity in '14.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Mark Rajkowski, is it possible to give us some sense of what type of investment dollars are going to be required in the real estate development side over the next 2 or 3 years?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, as we -- as I outlooked in my comments, we are setting aside approximately $75 million of the proceeds from the transaction to fund what really will be the lion's share of cash required to continue the -- to execute on our development plan. So as we get through those first 2 years, where the development is a little bit heavier than the cash we're bringing in from the land sales, we expect to be fully self-funding by year 3.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So just so I'm clear about this, so you may be spending more than the $75 million because you're also -- you may be doing some land sales within one or both of the ventures, is that right?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Well, yes. I mean, it's -- I look at it as -- it's like a checkbook where you got cash inflows and cash outflows. But at the end of the day, we'll be net cash positive in the third year. So obviously, there's going to be -- we're going to be generating some proceeds from sales of properties and we're going to be spending development. It might be -- your math is correct. I mean, it will be more than $75 million, but that's partially offset by sales of properties.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. Next question is, down in Brazil, and Rigesa, I wonder if itâs possible for you guys to give us a number that would just be Rigesa, and would be backing out Ruby Macons, just in terms of EBITDA and EBITDA margin down there?
John A. Luke
Mark, you've got that.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Mark, we, looking at Rigesa alone for the quarter, EBIT was around 16% and EBITDA was 23%.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. All right. Well, that's good improvement then. And I noticed Ruby [ph] was up the other day with 35%, is that still a reasonable target for you guys?
John A. Luke
Mark, I think, as they clearly have a different mix of businesses than we have, certainly with their sack craft and some of the container -- carton board business. But clearly, we see upside to the numbers that Mark gave you and we certainly would aspire to be in the upper 20s to low 30s, for sure.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And then, Jim, just the segment I continue to find the most disappointing is kind of Home, Health & Beauty. And I know that you've got some loss-making business in there. But when I look at it, you've just done $17 million year-to-date in EBIT, then if we back out the FX in the third quarter, only about $4 million and, if I just go back and I look at kind of Maybank plus Calmar plus Spray Plast, the Polytop, youâve put a lot of capital into that business, can you just help us understand how much of a drag these losing businesses are in performance right now, what the underlying business is doing?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Mark. I mean, there's lots of moving parts that go into Q3 but if I look at just the Folding Carton businesses and both in terms of the losses as well as the transition costs that we talked about, that was probably $2 million to $3 million in the third quarter. In addition, we have seen the impact of a fairly dramatic increases in resin. As you know, our businesses are tied to contracts. Those contracts lag anywhere from 3 to 6 months. So we have that impact as a drag on us as well. And then I think as we look going forward and as I referenced, we've seen a lot of opportunity for good improvement in 2014. Our efforts in Brazil with the re-purposing and the growth we're seeing there in the plastics business, gives us a lot of confidence that we'll see dramatic improvement down in South America as well.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
Okay. And my final question is just the fourth quarter comments, with the year-over-year comparison for the fourth quarter, would that include the $0.07 to $0.10, last year, that had, I think, about $23 million of real estate gains in it?
John A. Luke
Yes.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Mark.
Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division
So the net, if you're saying you're going to lose a little bit in development in the fourth quarter, so just the drag there would be about $27 million to $28 million, is that correct?
E. Mark Rajkowski
That's roughly right.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I guess, you touched on it a little bit, but can you give us more -- a little bit more color and update on where you stand in terms of the natural gas opportunities. Have they started building the pipeline at all and is anything been proven yet?
John A. Luke
We've had some testing of a number of wells but -- and the quality has been very good. But the entire build out has slowed down a little bit because of the pressure from lower pricing. So that has taken a bit of a stall. But based upon the work done to date, we really -- we think we've got some nice assets there.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. And in terms of the bridge for 2014, can you help us think about the paperboard price increases that were announced this year and how that might affect next year? Just from what you know, given the timing of the contract?
James A. Buzzard
Sure. Gail, as you know, we're in the throes of implementing those price increases and I think as we've talked, historically, our business is about 50% contract and 50% non-contract. So we have moved pricing on a non-contract business. We've seen sequential improvements as we came out of Q2 into Q3. We would expect as these contracts come due to move pricing on those. So we will see pricing improvement through Q4 and into 2014 as well.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay. But I mean -- but is it fair to say kind of more than half would be reflecting '14 versus '13, just given timing?
James A. Buzzard
Sure. I think in terms of both, when the contracts come due and the fact we've moved these prices throughout 2013, I think your assumption is correct.
Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Okay, and just 2 last quick ones. I thought there was a reference in the press release that there's some onetime gains that impacted the third quarter and chemicals. Could you discuss that and also maybe quantify the impact of the delayed shipments in tobacco, which I presume would benefit the fourth quarter?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, let me -- you want me to take the chemicals piece of that, Jim? Yes, we had some benefits from a business interruption insurance related to an explosion or fire that we had a number of quarters back. So that was roughly $2 million to $3 million and then, we had another $2 million plus for a legal settlement.
James A. Buzzard
And then, Gail, on the question of the tobacco shipments at the end of the quarter. As you know, we have a very strong position in the export market. It was simply timing where the vessel was not sailing until early in Q4 for some shipments to Asia. So we'll recognize those this quarter.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Jim, just to clarify on your contracted versus non-contracted for paperboard, does that ratio vary substantially between food, beverage and tobacco, as you think about the very thin markets? And also what was the phase end, in terms of timing on a monthly basis, during the third quarter, because I would assume that they expected the pricing curve to be little bit more favorable than it was?
James A. Buzzard
In terms of the contracts, it varies by marketplace. So certainly, in a market like the tobacco market, we have a higher percentage that would be -- it would be under contract. In our food business, itâll be somewhat less than the 50%. But again, it's going to vary by market and the average though as I said stays at about 50% or so. And in terms of the timing through the quarter, I don't really have a feel for you, in terms of what percent came each month of the third quarter, but it -- it just continued to build on itself and we continue to move pricing, as I've said feel good as we come into Q4, with further implementation and, certainly, as contracts come due towards the end of this year, early next year for their opportunities.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay, and then on the Specialty Chemicals business, you talked about some weakness in pine chemicals and you said it was sort of stabilizing as you looked out at the fourth quarter. Can you just provide some more insight there as to what's going on?
James A. Buzzard
Sure. In the chemicals business, there's a variety of raw materials that impacts some of the more standard products. So we have seen, through the course of 2013, falling off of gum prices coming from Asia, so that's impacted the bottom end of our markets. That began to stabilize in Q3. And so we've seen less pressure. But I think the real story for that business is, we have great innovative products that provide a lot of value for our customers, we're participating in those megatrend markets we've talked about in terms of oil and gas exploration, growth in automobiles, infrastructure growth as well. So the markets are strong. We've got great products and we participate in a lot of the emerging markets. So we continue to see a lot of opportunity for that business to perform well going forward.
Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division
Okay. And then, John, maybe one last one for you. So obviously you kind of reshaped the portfolio over the past few years, 2 years ago you announced the sale of the Office Products business and now essentially divesting land, how should we think about the residual business in terms of Specialty Chemicals that you sort of further align with packaging over time in terms of the timeline?
John A. Luke
I think for all of the reasons that Jim and Mark have indicated, Ghansham, we're very enthusiastic about the opportunities in Specialty Chemicals. We've got very attractive niche positions and we would look to expand those selectively as we go forward to have our shareholders benefit from the very attractive profitability that we see, that exists and will exist over time, and we see that as a very nice compliment to the strong global packaging business that we have.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Even if I set aside the CDLM business, it seems that you just reduced the 2014 EBITDA target by about $110 million to $160 million, obviously a pretty -- a big move. How much of that order of magnitude would be Brazil versus maybe what you're seeing in Food & Beverage or Home, Health & Beauty, and presumably, Specialty Chemicals isn't a big source of the change, would that be true?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Mark, I think when you look at the original target of $1.2 billion, a big chunk of it, obviously, is CDLM. The big chunk of it was FX. I mean, we -- there was a significant hit we've taken across our businesses, particularly in Brazil and into a lesser extent in our European business, from FX. And I think the rest of that is a combination of things. The economy has been a little bit more sluggish than we'd like. Obviously, you want to grow your business faster, as fast as you can but with tougher end markets, it makes it a little bit more challenging. So it really -- when you look at Brazil in terms of where we're at on the ramp and what we expected on the local currency basis, we're pretty much in line. So a lot -- obviously, CDLM is the biggest chunk. FX impact isn't too far away in terms of order of magnitude and the rest is just a little bit of sluggishness in the overall economy.
John A. Luke
Yes. I think, I mean, Mark you've summed it up well. I think, Mark, you can be sure that we'll be looking very hard to meet or exceed the target, but with the focus that you and others have had on this important metric, we just wanted to make the adjustments in expectations on this call, following the CDLM announcement.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay. And so to recap it, it sounds like FX, excuse me, would have been about how much of the $110 million, $160 million, is that about $80 million or so, by your estimation?
James A. Buzzard
That's roughly right.
Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay. And so then, the balance of $30 million to $80 million additional would be largely volume driven?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I would say, commercial-related volume, a little slower markets and it's hard to pin that on any one single item.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
So thank you, for spelling out the general plan for proceeds so that we don't have to guess. But your balance sheet is also still in pretty good shape. So is it safe to assume that for now, we're not going to see any more big M&A and that the reinvestment cycle, now that Brazil and Covington are done, is more or less complete?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Mark, I think that's a fair statement. We've invested a fair amount in our business over the last 2 to 3 years. And both internal greenfield capital -- CapEx, as well as some bolt-on acquisitions. But I think while we'll continue to look for opportunities to create value, both through growing our business organically, and bolt-on acquisitions, the focus clearly in 2014 and beyond is to really leverage and optimize the investments that we've made.
John A. Luke
And I think, I would just add, I think Mark has said that well, we see significant opportunity to do just that in each of our markets.
Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division
And just a follow-on to that, over the last couple of years, you've talked about wanting to have a dividend story that was a dividend growth story, is that still important to MeadWestvaco and its boardroom [ph]?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes. I mean, dividends follow earnings and cash flow. So we want to be in a position where we can consistently grow our earnings and cash flows, which supports the ability to provide more consistent returns, growing returns, to our shareholders.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I want to piggyback on Mark's question. So would it be fair to say then, that the direction of the regular quarterly dividend would be more driven by what improvement you see in the operation on a going-forward basis? Or, and will be less affected by the proceeds you receive or might the proceeds that you'll be receiving allow you to raise the regular dividend?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I think you really want to look at your fundamental underlying business in operations and cash flows. And that's really what we look at. We have a policy where we look to pay out 40% to 60% of our cash flow, after CapEx. And you want to be in a position where you can do that. Over the last couple of years because of the heavy capital spend on some of these projects you've really been above that rate. But certainly have felt that, that was a little bit artificial and the fundamental business still had the ability to support the level of dividend that we're paying. And as you saw in today's announcement, despite the loss of a pretty substantial chunk of EBITDA, in cash, we've got great confidence in our ability to continue to grow our core businesses and maintain that dividend. But we're not satisfied with that. We want to continue to grow earnings and cash flow so we can support increasing returns to our shareholders.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Thanks for that, Mark. Next question I had, you mentioned you expect significant improvement -- Home, Health & Beauty, and that's obviously, been a segment we've talked a lot about in our Q&A with you over the last few quarters and years. Is it possible to quantify, at this juncture, if you hold input costs flat, hold currency flat, what kind of improvement would be significant to you for '14 and, similar question, piggybacking I think on something that Phil had asked earlier, you have -- you're doing a great job on the cost reduction program. You're ahead of schedule. You have Mahrt coming back up. You're done with the ramp-up in Rigesa that continues, what do you think you have as a controllable improvement to earnings for next year versus '13. Could you quantify either of those?
John A. Luke
Before jumping to the details of your question, George, let me just say, at the outset, that, obviously, there have been a lot of questions about this and we understand and view them as justifiable. We have a new leader in place, as we've talked before, Pete Durette, whose providing excellent strategic leadership for that business and one of the things that we would intend to do early in 2014, is have an investor event where we can provide a much greater degree of transparency to that business that you raise questions about, what has been a drag in the past, but most importantly, give you a strong sense of the opportunities that Pete and his team see before us.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
And in terms of trying to quantify anything at this juncture you would like to hold up until '14 then?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I think what John said is absolutely the right approach. And we can give you a better view at that point in time.
George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
All right, my last question, I'll turn it over. Obviously, again, the timberland transaction is certainly a positive. Again, it's been something you've been working on for a while, but it's also been a business that, over the years, has been a shock absorber of sorts for the company relative -- whatever trend you might be seen in the manufacturing business. So now, that it's going to be gone and you're not going to have that level of earnings and cash flow, what changes should we see, if any, from the investment community in terms of how MeadWestvaco further makes its manufacturing businesses, its ongoing recurring businesses more effective, more urgently run and so on?
John A. Luke
George, I think, overall, we're operating with greater discipline. I think some of the wake ups we had earlier this year reinforced to us the imperative of operating productively and efficiently, and this is going to be also well served by execution of the market-based strategies we have, which are focused on much greater participation and more stable, more attractive markets over time.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
You all discussed new capacity and then box board in China I think has largely already come online or at least that initial wave. Can you talk about if youâve seen any impacts from that new capacity in China thatâs come online on your export business and when do you think there may be any impact on the business in 2014?
James A. Buzzard
Alex, let me comment, at a high level. I think as we've talked on a pretty consistent basis, we've worked very hard, just building on my last response to George's question to build positions in much more stable specialized markets that can bring much greater return to our bottom line and in turn, to our shareholders. And particular, in the board side, we've focused on liquid packaging, tobacco, among others. We're clearly aware of what has been happening in China. Our positions have -- as we've shaped our positions, we've not been impacted in any way but it's uncertain what 2014 is going to hold as a lot of that capacity comes on, not only online but is brought to the marketplace. But our best defense is a strong offense, which is execution of the market strategies that we have in place.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And then, on the CapEx spend of, I believe, $375 million to $400 million, $375 million to $400 million for '14, I believe, that would be above your maintenance capital for the business? If that's the case, can you just talk about where the growth capital would be targeted towards in '14?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, we have, as we mentioned in past quarters, made investments in Brazil, with the acquisition of Resitec, and India, with the acquisition of Ruby Macons, and the -- an important part of those business cases is the capacity expansion and improvements. And so that's -- that would be 2 examples of areas where we're investing for growth. We have opportunities in our Medical Plastics business. We've got great opportunities, as Jim pointed out in his comments, related to the growth that we're seeing in fragrance, and some of our other pumps and dispensers products. And a big part of our transformation around our -- the exit of the folding carton business is not just the exit through -- via sale in Europe, which is moving along. But also, the re-purposing of our folding carton operations and some investment in capital to do that, to really grow our pumps and dispensers business, beauty and personal care business in Brazil. So those are some examples of where we're very excited and focused in terms of growing our business.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And one just last quick one, you talked about some corrugated packaging in the U.S. moving to your lighter weight paperboard solutions, can you maybe put a little more color around what product lines are shifting and sort of what the runway is, going forward, for the conversions away from corrugated to your solutions?
James A. Buzzard
Sure, Alex. What we're seeing is our high strength paperboard out of Mahrt, so our CUK, really displacing corrugated applications in things like food and beverage. So some of the larger quantity glass packaging that has been in corrugated, over time, is moving to our product. We're also seeing it in some of the multi-pack for some of the food products as well. So we would expect where that value solution is playing to continue to make those changes. It's good for us and it's good for our customers as well.

And we'll go to the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just a question on the costs savings, you've got this $75 million goal by the end of 2014. Just wondering what the key metrics that you're following around that. When I compare you to the rest of my coverage universe here, youâre high on SG&A as a percentage of sales but that could be a function of my coverage universe, so maybe you could also align who would be best-in-class and then what the effect also is of the sale of the -- your timberlands business on SG&A?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, Paul, the -- so we're tough -- we are a tough compare because we do have a number of different businesses that have business models, which have -- require different SG&A structures. So what we have in Food & Beverage is very different from what we need in beauty personal care, healthcare different -- they're both different from what we need in Specialty Chemicals. What we're focused on is really getting as lean and as efficient in our overhead costs. And some of those costs, whether they're at corporate or in some of our businesses, as we take them out, part of it gets book capped or accounted for in SG&A. Some of that gets charged to cost of goods sold. So we're continuously looking at how we can be best-in-class, okay, relative to our peers and competitors in those different spaces that we participate in. And we're going to be relentless in our pursuit of that.
