Dominik Heger 
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the call for the results of the first half 2014. The call will be hosted by Georg Denoke, member of the Executive Board and CFO; also available for your questions will be Professor Aldo Belloni, member of the Executive Board. I will now hand over to Georg Denoke for his presentation.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, thank you, Dominic, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call also from my side.
In the first half year, we realized EUR 8.212 billion revenues, which is comparable to last year's level on a reported basis. Exchange rate effects continued to have a significant adverse impact on reported growth. Adjusted for the negative currency impact, revenue was up 5.6%. The comparable growth in our Gases Division was 3.7% adjusted for the expected health care tender effects in Europe and North America. Underlying, we saw accelerated growth rates in the merchant business and on the other hand, we had a plant shutdown in our tonnage business.
We generated an operating profit of EUR 1.896 billion, which is on a reported basis, 3.6% below the figure of last year and adjusted for currency impact, 1.7% above last year's figure. This results in a group margin of 23.1%. The lower margin is a result of the higher share of revenues of our Engineering Division in the mix.
EPS was EUR 3.36. Affecting the development was the tax rate of 23.9%, which was as expected above the level of the first half of 2013. As you know, in the prior year period, various one-off effects had an positive impact on the income tax rate.
I will move on to a short breakdown of the performance by division on the next slide. Against the background of headwinds from still unfavorable exchange rates, and as expected, a slow first half in our Health Care business, we achieved revenue in the Gases Division of EUR 6.825 billion. On a comparable basis, growth was 3.7% adjusted for the expected health care tender effects.
In the Engineering Division, we are currently working on the execution of our high order backlog. This is reflected in the increase of revenues by 13.6%.
The Gases Division generated operating profit of EUR 1.863 billion, which was 2.7% below the number of the first half year -- of the first half of last year, excuse me. Adjusted for the currency headwinds, operating profit grew by 2.5%. With 27.3%, the margin reached again the high level of last year.
The Engineering Division realized operating profit of EUR 141 million, which is slightly below the high level of last year. This results in a margin of 9.9%, which is above the industry average and fully in line with our forecast.
Following the short summary on the performance, I will move on to a more detailed picture of the performance of the Gases Division.
I move to Slide 5. Compared to 2013, we saw a 0.5% higher and therewith slightly margin dilutive effect of natural gas prices on a global basis. From a geographical perspective, the most significant impact on margins occurred in Americas because of natural gas price increases. Additionally, you'll see that the negative impact from exchange rate effects was 5.8%. Against many currency, the euro was stronger in the first half of this year than in the same period last year.
One recent change needs to be pointed out here. A new exchange rate system was introduced in Venezuela, with significant changes in exchange rates, which we had to apply from 1st of April 2014. Therewith, we had a negative impact on group sales of EUR 27 million in the reporting period, which is included here in currency changes.
The underlying price and volume effect in the Gases Division was 2.7%. As already indicated, expected negative impacts in our product area, health care, reduced the growth by 100 basis points. Without these effects, the price volume effect would have been 3.7%.
The next slide shows the revenue development in the Gases Division on a comparable basis by product areas.
In health care, we achieved growth of 1.5%. Adjusted for the just mentioned tender effects, the growth in health care was 6% and therewith, the comparable growth of the Gases would be 3.7%.
As you might recall, we have outlined in our last communication that in the first half of this year, we expect growth rates in health care below average mainly due to 2 effects: one, affect results from the price reduction as a result of Competitive Bidding 2 in the U.S. markets, which became effective last year 1st of July. And from the acceleration of growth in the second quarter, you can see that volume growth starts to partially offset the price effect. The second effect is the loss of tenders in Europe, in particular, in the business we acquired from Air Products in 2012. Those tenders has already been submitted by Air Products during the acquisition phase, and we have already received compensation for these lost tenders in July.
I would like to reiterate that our guidance of 4% to 5% growth in health care this year remains unchanged.
In Tonnage, we had growth of 4.5%, which was impacted by a planned maintenance shutdown in Europe. Excluding this effect, growth in tonnage was 6.3% for the half year period. The highest contribution to growth came from Asia and Eastern Europe. In Bulk, we saw with 4.3% and further acceleration of growth for the sixth quarter in a row.
From a geographic perspective, North America, Greater China reported this positive development.
In Cylinder, the growth was 0.6% for the half year. Growth accelerated in the second quarter to 0.9% compared to 0.3% in the first quarter. This acceleration has to be seen in the light of the continuation of 2 negative effects we have already seen in the first quarter. In particular, in the important cylinder market, Australia, we had a decline in volumes as a result of reduced investments and therewith lower construction and maintenance activities in the mining sector. And additionally, strikes in South Africa affected the volume development in the first and now also in the second quarter.
I move on to the reporting segments on the following slides and start with Europe, Middle East and Africa. This is Slide 7.
In EMEA, revenue of EUR 2.978 billion was slightly below the figure for the prior year period. On a comparable basis, the growth was 0.5%. Against the prevailing background of modest economic growth in the eurozone, revenue in the merchant business was slightly above the figure achieved last year.
Regarding health care, I have already explained the expected negative effect from lost tenders.
In Continental Europe, Tonnage growth was temporarily offset by the stoppage for repair of an hydrogen plant in Italy. On the other hand, there were positive trends in Tonnage in most of the areas, especially in U.K. and in the Middle East.
I would like to mention 2 startups that occurred in the second quarter, one in Romania. Here, we started a syngas plant to supply hydrogen and carbon monoxide via pipeline to the refinery of OMV. In Norway, we brought on stream, an air separation plant to supply the steel company, Celsa, and also provide products for the regional markets.
In the second reporting segment, Asia Pacific reported growth was hampered mainly by unfavorable exchange rate effects. Given these conditions, revenue was 4.3% below the figure for the prior year quarter.
On a comparable basis, we achieved 5.4% growth. We saw a positive development in the Bulk business in all regions of Asia Pacific and in particular, in Greater China. In Greater China, in general, we saw the most positive trend. Supported by volume increases in all product areas, we were able to achieve double-digit revenue growth here. As a result of the ramp-up of plants, revenue in Tonnage increased at a fast rate as well.
Also in South and East Asia, the development was supported by solid growth from ramp and startup of new plants. For example, in Map Ta Phut in Thailand, a plan for the production of liquefied carbon dioxide for the supply of the regional market started up in the second quarter.
In South Pacific, the economic environment in the manufacturing industry remained weak and investment in the mining industry declined. Both sectors had an adverse impact on growth in particular on cylinders.
In the first segment, Americas' revenue was not quite as high as last year, which is to a large degree, a result of unfavorable exchange rates. The impact of EUR 27 million due to the change of the Venezuelan exchange rate system was explained earlier. On a comparable basis, revenue increased by 3.8%.
In North America, as already indicated, the Health Care business was characterized by strong volume growth, which partly compensated for the negative impact from Competitive Bidding 2.
We achieved solid growth in bulk, which was also supported by positive pricing. Additionally, we brought on stream an air separation plant in Texas in the second quarter to supply industrial gases to regional customers.
Another step to further strengthen our footprint in the refinery business in North America was the signing of an on-site supply agreement with Lima Refinery Company in the second quarter. We will invest more than EUR 70 million in the Ohio-based complex. The project includes the construction of a third hydrogen plant and upgrade to existing facilities to increase our cluster production capacity and operational flexibility. The new hydrogen plant is scheduled to come on stream in the year 2016.
In South America, the economic situation failed to improve in the first half of this year. In some countries, the economy is characterized by persistent high inflation and relatively low rates of growth. In particular, in Brazil, the development of our merchant business was rather soft.
An air separation and pressure swing adsorption plant started production in the second quarter in Ecuador. This plant supplies steel-producer Andec Steel and the regional market with industrial gases.
I continue on Page 8 with the profitability of our reporting segments.
In EMEA, operating profit grew to EUR 898 million, which resulted in an operating margin of 29.9%. The development was supported by stronger contributions from U.K., as well as Central and Eastern Europe.
In Asia, operating profit fell by 4.2% to EUR 476 million. The operating margin remained stable at 26.2%. Currency headwinds and weaker development in South Pacific impacted the development.
Operating profit in Americas dropped by 8.1% to EUR 498 million. The operating margin held to 23.8%. In North America, the development of operating profit was impacted by exchange rate effects and the price reduction in health care as part of CB2. The margin development was additionally impacted by higher natural gas prices.
In South America, inflation in Venezuela and in some of the other South American countries has a negative impact on operating profit and margin.
After outlining the regional split, I would like to move on to our Engineering division. This is Slide 9.
I would like to remind you that engineering is a project business. For that reason, a comparison on a quarterly basis is more difficult. In the first half of the year, our Engineering Division achieved an increase in revenue of 13.6%, while operating profit was not quite as high as last year. The realized margin of 9.9% is above the industry average and in line with the target we have set for the full year. With EUR 1.058 billion in order intake, we saw a significant -- we saw an order intake significantly below the outstanding high number in the previous year. As a reminder, last year, we received a major order to build a large ethylene plant for ExxonMobil in Houston. At that point in time, we were not allowed to communicate this contract because of confidentiality reasons.
Other important orders were EUR 450 million for the construction of the 6 air separation plants on behalf of Reliance Industry in India, and the order for 6 jumbo ASUs in China for Shenhua, worth around EUR 200 million. All these projects are currently in the execution phase.
With a softer order intake, we also received less advance payments compared to previous years.
From an order intake perspective, around 75% of the current order intake came from North America and Europe.
Orders related to natural gas, as well as hydrogen and syngas plants accounted for more than 70% of the order intake. The order backlog is on the very high level of EUR 4.1 billion, and we are working on a very promising opportunity pipeline. In this context, I would like to mention that we signed an framework agreement with Shell for the development of future plant projects in the petrochemical field. The agreement runs for 10 years and can be extended.
After outlining the performance of our divisions, I would like to move on to our financial position. This is Slide 10.
The credit rating of Standard & Poor's is A+ and unchanged, whereas Moody's upgraded the rating from A3 to A2. The outlook of both ratings are stable.
Net debt rose during the reporting period to EUR 9.2 billion. Included in this increase is the issue of the EUR 300 million bond, which was issued to further external funding of the pension plans in Europe -- in Germany. The 10-year bond had a coupon of 1.875% and was issued at 40 basis points over the euro mixed swap rate.
Adjusted for the one-off effect of the EUR 300 million bond, the dynamic indebtedness factor net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.3x and therewith on the same level as last year. Overall, our financial debt maturity profile continues to be conservative. Approximately, 50% of the noncurrent debt has a longer maturity than 5 years. Also, short-term maturities are very limited. Bonds worth about EUR 420 million will become due over the next 12 months.
I conclude the presentation with the outlook. Although the global economy has grown at a slower rate than expected by the macroeconomists, in the first half of this year, we reiterate our outlook for this year because we have seen acceleration in the second quarter to the end of the second quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, we expect on the group level, solid increases in revenue and moderate increase in operating profit compared to 2013.
In our Gases Division, we had plan to grow at moderate pace on an exchange rate adjusted basis. In our Tonnage business, we have a sound project pipeline, which will make a contribution to revenue and earnings on a more significant contribution in 2015 and '16.
For Bulk in Cylinder, we assume growth in line with macroeconomic trends. We have already outlined our expectations for health care for the full year. With our portfolio different plan types in our Engineering Division and then high order backlog, we are well positioned to generate a solid increase in revenue in 2014.
As pointed out, we assume to achieve an operating margin of around 10% in 2014.
For 2016, we aim to achieve group operating profit of at least EUR 5 billion and a return on capital employed of around 13%. Our medium-term outlook is based on current economic forecast according to which the global economy will grow at a faster rate in the coming years than it did in the last 2 years. And the assumption that there will be no -- not be a significant shift in exchange rates compared with those prevailing at the end of 2012, when the medium-term outlook was formulated. We are not in a position to anticipate exchange rate developments until 2016. To be cautious, we have outlined, as you know, that if exchange rates, over the coming years, remain at a similar level to those which have applied recently, this would reduce group operating profit by around EUR 400 million in 2016.
It might also have an adverse effect or impact on return on capital employed. As you know, under our HPO program, we target gross cost savings of EUR 750 million to EUR 900 million in 4 years from 2013 to 2016.
In short summary, the first half of the year was again impacted by negative currency effects and the expected tender effects in health care. We have seen stronger volume growth in the merchant business and in the steel industry, therefore, we expect in the second half of the year an acceleration of growth in general and in the manufacturing industry in particular. Also, an increase of cash flow is expected in the second half of the year.
Before we take your questions, I would like to inform you that we have decided to reschedule our Capital Markets Day from 13 and 14 October to 30th and 31st of October. We have received feedback from the investor community that the planned dates collide with some of their schedules. To accommodate that and also ease travel logistics, we have decided to move the Capital Markets Day to Munich again. We hope that our flexibility is appreciated by you, and look forward to seeing you on the 30th of October in Munich. Dominick will send out the updated schedule for the Capital Market Day later today.
We now look forward to taking your questions. I hand over back to Pierre. Pierre, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Stephan Kippe of Commerzbank.
Stephan Kippe - Commerzbank AG, Research Division
Three questions, if I may. First of all, in health care, the negative effect from the loss of the European tenders and CB2, you mentioned that effect in a cumulative sense. And I understand that you do probably don't want to go in too much of a detail. But if I assume that the CB2 effect is quite a bit larger than the loss of the tenders effect, is that -- would that be a correct assumption? First question. Second question, from Air Products, we heard that you received a $158 million compensation payment for the loss of these European tenders. Is that payment, a compensation for the full lost revenue of this contracts? Or does this payment also reflect the fact that you probably have quite reduced cost because you don't have to serve this contracts anymore? And third question about these customer turnarounds. So as I understand, a certain amount of customer turnaround is the normal game in industrial gases, depending on the end-user industries. Has this one been unusually big? Has this been an unusual concentration of turnarounds? To what extent was this unforeseen? And also maybe if you could tell us what the industries were affected by these customer turnarounds in Europe?
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, thank you, Stephan, for your questions. On the question #1 related to the health care effect, it's right what you assumed that, of course, Competitive Bidding 2 effect is more significant than the AP home care effect in Europe. On the contract side from an comp perspective, receiving the funds from AP, I think this is really too much detail here at that point in time, but it's definitely a compensation in line with the purchase price we paid, which means it's really related to the recurring effect of the lost tenders. I think I can say that one. On the customer turnaround issues, you're absolutely right, we normally have planned schedule for turnarounds. We are pointing out here to on more pronounced effect for 1 contract in Italy, which is a hydrogen contract. Therefore, of course, significant -- more significant in size because of because the pass-through of the natural gas, as you know. And here, this was unplanned, and that is what we have to point out here. That was not foreseen from us. Otherwise, we would guide different for the second quarter.

The next question comes from Peter Clark, SocGen.
Peter Clark - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
I've got 3 as well. Actually, the first one, obviously, you're sticking with the targets which you've started, obviously, with a caveat of some Forex, but one gets the impression that these can, will wash out there so far, we'll see in October, of course. So that's the first question. Second question is related again to Lincare. You threw out the comment that the volume growth partly compensate this time for the price effect, which I think is the first quarter you've probably seen negative underlying growth in Lincare. Now reading into the margins side of the Americas, the natural gas effect is slightly less from the first quarter. I hear what you're seeing on that Latin America, but I must get a sense that Lincare is down at least the average of the Americas hit on EBITDA margin, which I can push 200 basis points year-on-year. And -- so that's the second question. And then the third question on China. Pretty encouraging noises we're getting from China, not just from you, but from some of the other companies. And you're obviously pointing a pretty strong volume growth also in the merchant side or the industrial merchant side. Just tell how that compares with what the pricing situation is over there? One sense is that market is starting to tighten, a lot of discipline even though more capacity's coming on, et cetera. So those are the 3 questions.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, thank you, Peter. I'll start really with the Lincare question because I think that's a totally wrong conclusion overall in your summary. Therefore, I want to jump in here. I think what we have seen is in roughly around 10% volume growth in Lincare and from a price perspective, we have seen less than the 10%. So that was, I think, important to understand. So the driver here I think is a mix effect. I also assume that the natural gas price effect in North America was more pronounced in the second quarter than in the first quarter. I think this is also important to understand. And then we have really, as I pointed out, seen an weaker South America mainly in Brazil, but also in some other countries in South America. That is in -- and contributed here. The first question, I really don't get it. We are sticking with the target. I can confirm, yes, we are sticking with the targets, but what was exactly the point? We assume acceleration, I think, if this is a background, we assume acceleration in the second half of the year. We normally have stronger growth in the second half of the year anyway. And when we look into this quarter, especially, we have to point out that towards the end of the quarter, the growth was much more pronounced than what we communicated as quarter growth for Q2. I think that's very important. And we have seen 2 effects overall there where we are, let's say, supported with this view from current trading conditions. One is we have seen Tonnage in steel also in Europe accelerating further than only in U.K. We were pointing out U.K. last time, we have seen further acceleration in steel in Continental and also in Northern Europe. And this is normally a very good indicator for the merchant development which comes because in manufacturing, the steel has to be transformed. So from a manufacturing industry perspective, that should be seen. And we have seen a little bit growth, as you know, and I'm talking soft in cylinder from 0.3% to 0.9%. That is against the background of really and hit and also South Pacific, as you know. So when we look into where the growth came through, some of that was offset by South Pacific and again, South Africa was a pity, honestly, with the strikes continuing in this quarter and moving to other sectors. So that's a tough one to be in a position to forecast that. So nevertheless, from the trading conditions, we assume that, that was positive. And then, of course, the Asian story. And that brings me to your third question about China. What I pointed out double-digit growth is sales growth, which means not only volume. So from this perspective, of course, we have seen price pressure in this market. But nevertheless, overall, sales growth is very positive. But the volumes which are coming onstream into different market places, that's a regional play in some of these markets, you have an high capacity at that stage, and that is pressure on the pricing. But overall, I think, we are very satisfied with the development.
Peter Clark - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
Okay. And obviously, I was referring also to the 2016 targets with a caveat to Forex. So I was just saying no real changes what I'm trying to get the message of.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, okay. I think you could adjust for some of the currencies in the negative direction and for some last recently for positive direction, when you see dollar development, when you see pound development. But it is too early really. I think it doesn't make sense from the perspective. We only wanted to point out that we had assumed certain currencies at the end of '12 which are, at that moment in time, not in the market visible.

Our next question comes from Rakesh Patel, Goldman Sachs.
Rakesh Patel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Just a couple of questions, if I can. And from your recent comments on growth in the second half. Anything that you could tell us -- any more color on the Tonnage contract that you have coming on. I guess some of those will have really come on in the second quarter and should ramp up in Q3 and Q4. I was just wondering how we should think about that startup growth in the second half and going into 2015? Secondly, just in terms of the cylinder business, obviously, it's little bit weak in Australia because of the mining segment. I wonder if there's anything that you can do here in terms of optimizing the cost structure in the short term or whether you would ever look to exit Australian mining. And then finally, I just want to check, I've got my maths right that if you were to exclude the negative effects of health care or from health care that you saw in the quarter and the impact of the Italian hydrogen plants that your comparable growth would have been closer to around 4%, which puts you almost in the benchmark of your peer group although I know you shouldn't really to exclude these effects but I just wanted you to check.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, thanks, Rakesh, for your questions. I think in Tonnage, it's tough when you have an unplanned shutdown, which we experienced in the quarter here to forecast on a maintenance and repair issue. But overall, I think, of course, we have seen an weaker Tonnage quarter significantly really weaker than the second half. I would assume that we will end up around 5% in Tonnage at the year end to give you some guidance. Probably, it's depending on how everything goes when we see more negative things than more too far, but definitely my perspective is at that moment in time, around 5% to give a little bit more flavor, because some things are coming onstream. Some came on stream this quarter, but, of course, not at its full peak level and therefore, there will be also an ramp up through the second half of the year. On the -- only to talk about ISP, I think you know that we have been market leader position there from an market share perspective, but not only from a market share perspective also, I think, overall, we are the market leader when we talk about applications and our strong technical capabilities for customers . Therefore, of course, we are continuously adjusting overall the network, you can say, to current trading conditions, especially when you see that the mining industry is not aggressively coming back, therefore, from this perspective that something we have to do and the story of Australia is nevertheless in strong market share position. And therefore to exit certain sector, if that not makes sense at all for us, when you assume an high market share, it's rather really the consolidation and the focus on the customers which is important. At that point in time, we can't, let's say, influence the trading conditions in the manufacturing industry based on these reasons I pointed out. We will see for the next quarter certain accelerations through the seasonal development of LPG because we are now in the wintertime and that have some normally a positive seasonal influence from an recovery of Australia. But overall, we have to adjust to the trading conditions I was talking about if this is not changing in an certain period. And then the adjustment of quarter 2 growth. I think, of course, you could adjust more if you want. But I think we do not just on honestly significant parameter effects because then, you are talking only adjustments. Therefore, we were pointing out only here the health care effects, which we had as an issue from the beginning when we made these decisions. And that is I think what we wanted to. Of course, the number would be higher, I don't know. It could be 4%, probably a little bit less I assume when you include Tonnage issues. But you also have to see the other issues. And then that it has become difficult when you see the South African performance at that moment in time, and you see how a country behaves from an strike perspective, and if you're really eating into their strengths on a more significant basis, this is very sad. So on this perspective, you could adjust more, but I think that doesn't help us. But overall, trading conditions on an adjusted basis, of course, are higher.

The next question comes from Mr. Thomas Gilbert, UBS.
Thomas Gilbert - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Three questions. The first is on the mix of order intake in Engineering. I'm just tracking it over time, the portion of air separation units have now come down to, I think, for the half year, a 11% for the quarter, 8% and a significant shift towards natural gas and hydrogen. But is -- does nobody needs oxygen anymore? I mean, I thought the CapEx cycle for industrial gas segment, gas was strong. So can you just talk to you again why, is this temporary, why the mix is the way it is in the order intake? That's the first question. The second question, I do apologize, I have to go back to the Q1 numbers due to the disclosure. But I do understand there was -- the gases EBITDA in the first quarter was positive impact by I think EUR 28 million of one or several plant sales. Can you please -- so that we got the model right for the Q1 '15 because we used Q1 '14 as a base, where that was and what it was and why it wasn't disclosed when the first quarter report was issued? And the last question is on the margin, the operating margin in Europe in the second quarter. Again, much higher than what I was looking for, which is obviously good. Is the following happening? Is the fact that you have an outage in hydrogen, the fact that you have less hydrogen revenue in the mix boosting the margins? Or has there been an insurance payment into the second quarter or has there been a take-or-pay payment into the second quarter? Just trying to understand the financial impact of the shutdown on the margin in the second quarter EMEA gas margin.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Thank you, Thomas, for your questions. I think I'll hand over to Dr. Belloni for the oxygen question. I'll start with the second question here on the sale. That was not in plant sale, that was a Linde sale, and it was also disclosed in our report. I checked it because I heard that you didn't see it. It was really in the first quarter report. We apologize that we didn't cover that in the Q&A, honestly, but we were focusing, I think, on other issues. And for us, it was not an extraordinary impact -- event, let's say it that way because only to tell you the story, we have an 135-year-old business with a lot of activities when you talk about filling plants, which are, at one moment in time in city areas. And when we started hundred years ago, these are more rural areas for safety reasons. And that is something which we have, when you talk about our, let's say, 100-country footprint, that we have on a continuous basis. So we buy land for creating filling plant. That was the reason. It was pointed out. You can reconcile that also with a cash flow number. I think in the documentation also of the half-year report, which was EUR 41 million. This number is not changed. And then you can find in the annex of course the book value, which was also pointed out, in total, it was EUR 13 million. But we wouldn't consider all of that always extraordinary, honestly, because we have a little bit of that always but you cannot, of course, exclude that for the quarter. So the number you would have to exclude if you see this as only extraordinary would be then under EUR 28 million. Then on the operating margin of EMEA, the development here is, as you point out, it's a combination of effects. I think one to point out is the shutdown of Milazzo, which is not the most -- this is the Italian plant, excuse me, which is for us not the most profitable plant on earth, and it has a big pass-through on hydrogen. So that has a positive move up. There are no insurance claims included. The rest is a mix effect, mainly, I think where we have seen further improvement in EMEA, when we are talking about Middle East, especially here, we have a positive development. That is what I think is it's -- the main point. So when we then talk about the ASU, I hand over to Dr. Belloni here.
Aldo E. Belloni
Yes, good afternoon, Dr. Gilbert. Your observation with regard to the deceleration of the oxygen business is correct. But everything has to be put in perspective with what happened last year. Last year was a extraordinary year with a very large or mega large projects in China like the 12 oxygen packages for Shenhua or the 5 oxygen packages for Reliance. We don't have a Reliance this year, we don't have a Shenhua this year. But this that doesn't mean that this projects are not existing. We still have some of this in the pipeline. We see this year more a return to, let's say, the core oxygen business, big single packages for steel factories in China and even in Europe, even in Germany. And but we see also on a medium term, a big oxygen facilities coming up in Southern Saudi Arabia and in Qatar. So I think it's a period in terms of investment attitude, but it's not a big interruption.

Our next question comes from Mr. Neil Tyler, Redburn.
Neil Christopher Tyler - Redburn Partners LLP, Research Division
I just really wanted to -- I've got one remaining question on the CapEx run rate that you've witnessed so far in the Gases business. Appears to be some way below the rate to which you had guided. Is that because -- is there a currency impact in the lower CapEx spend? Is it likely be back-end loaded or it representing perhaps a reducing level of activity? I wonder if you could update us on CapEx expectations for both this year and next, if you're willing to.
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Yes, thanks, Neil, for your question here. I think it's an important observation that the flight level is lower than we guided it. I think it's all of what you said it. It's FX related, definitely. It's always back-end loaded. And on the reduced level of activity, I would only take into consideration that this is effecting our merchant activity, which was softer in the first half year than we anticipated in the -- at the beginning of the year, as you know. Also the macroeconomic forecast were slightly higher and began that the relief of so-called gas distribution equipment, which are cylinder, trucks and tanks are then on a more conservative level. Of course, because we do not spend if we can't grow. That's also in all of our interest, so -- but that was in smaller part. And, of course, we have to release also earlier when we assume capacity comes back. And at that stage, we have reduced PDE [ph] for the further recovery of the merchant markets. Therefore, I think, it's what you pointed out and what I added at.
Neil Christopher Tyler - Redburn Partners LLP, Research Division
And perhaps I could push in that case. Would you be able to give us some indication of the split of your guided CapEx this year between the various businesses?
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
I think that is too much detail for us. Thank you.

The next question comes from Mr. Markus Mayer, Baader Bank.
Markus Mayer
Three questions as well. I got them back on U.S. questions, maybe I didn't get it to right. CapEx spending this year, is now the guidance somewhat lower due to Forex effects or should we still expect to guide that amount for the full year? Then secondly, basically a similar question on D&A. You also have a flat rate that somewhat lower than the D&A guidance for the full year of EUR 1.8 billion. Is this -- also still valid for Q3 or do you expect a lower D&A rate due to Forex impacts? And then lastly, I'm missing the slide portfolio of opportunities. Can you give us an update on the current portfolio opportunities, please?
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
Okay. So Markus, I think we do not have prepared an -- a full update and a very concrete update on the CapEx number. So let's say, it's not 2.2 anymore. I think it's 2.12. That is at that moment in time what we can see. So I think not below 2 somewhere between 2 and 2.1, I would assume. That's now short-term update without, let's say, in detail review. But we see definitely acceleration through the end of the year. So do me a favor. The second question was related to depreciation and amortization?
Markus Mayer
D&A, yes, I thought you have -- would have a D&A guidance for the full year for around EUR 1.8 billion and so far, your run rate is somewhat slightly above EUR 400 million. So my question is, I assume...
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
I got you. I understand. So I think it's around EUR 1.7 billion, then. Yes, and the update on the opportunity pipeline -- we haven't given an update this quarter, as you know, but it's on the same level of EUR 4 billion roughly.

The next question comes from Mr. John Klein, Berenberg.
John Philipp Klein - Berenberg, Research Division
There's only one left from my side. The pension top up, the EUR 300 million that you put into the German pension plan. If interest rates remain as low as they are, could we expect that you do see similar moves of taking on debt to put the money into pension plans in the future?
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
John, thanks for the question. I think important question. I think we had an extraordinary situation as a German company. You know that pension funding was and is mainly on the balance sheet. Linde is in a way an kind of exception also when you compare that with our international pension plans, which are more or less all funded and, therefore, we have made these extraordinary decision. But I wouldn't make a rule out of that now. I think we have used here the opportunity with the low interest and put in -- into the German pension plan what we thought is at that stage appropriate, but no guidance for the future because it's a small number anyway then.

The next question comes from Nils-Peter Fitz, Hauck & Aufhauser.
Nils-Peter Fitzl - Hauck & Aufhauser Institutional Research AG
There's only one left and it relates to your statement you made earlier about the acceleration in Q2. So a kind of a current trading update here. Could you maybe shed some light on where this is coming from, like in terms of regions and from which industries?
Georg Johannes Gerhard Denoke
I think when we go -- I think I went through the downside significantly. South Africa, South Pacific, South America, so the southern hemisphere is on a weaker trading level. So pointing out the positive things I was mentioning, really, U.K. is positive. Eastern Europe is coming back positive visibility in EMEA margin from a mix effect. Scandinavia is coming back and North America also more positive. And then you have seen the strong volume sales contribution and volume contribution in China on a continuously high level -- continuing high level. Industry-wise, steel, as I pointed out, Dr. Belloni pointed it out, steel is from a volume perspective coming back for -- especially really for the mature markets, I have to admit.
So there are no further questions. Then I thank you for the lively discussion, and look forward really to see you all at the Capital Markets Day on the 30th of October and then continuing on the 31st of October. But Dominic will send out the details. So thank you and bye-bye.
