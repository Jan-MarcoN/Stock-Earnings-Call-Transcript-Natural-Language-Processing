And these are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.solarcity.com.
With that finally behind us I would like to introduce SolarCity's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lyndon Rive.
Lyndon Rive
Thank you, Aaron. Overall 2014 was an incredible year. We had some commercial construction delays but our performance residential was remarkable. Here some of the highlights for the year. We had a $3 billion in nominal contracted payments, our retained value increased by $1.4 billion. We lowered our unit cost by 20% despite the fact that module pricing stayed roughly flat. We grow residential megawatts by 106%. And we have closed most of our structured financing funds for 2013.
Now let's focus on the fourth quarter. I'm going to hand it over to Tanguy Serra, our Chief Operating Officer to discuss the operational results.
Tanguy Serra
Thanks, Lyndon. So overall we ended the quarter at 176 megawatts and 502 megawatts for the full-year, up 110% residential and up 70% in overall megawatts. We continue to be on track with our ambition to continue doubling and the over 9600 men and women at SolarCity are focused on our 2015 guidance of 950 megawatts to a gigawatt.
Weâve build 28 megawatts worth of commercial jobs in Q4. We had a further 60megawatts worth of commercial jobs so we had forecast that would make into Q4. We won't build 2 megawatts of those 60 megawatts given the economics of the projects changed but the remaining 40 megawatts either already built, being built or well be the built for Q1 or Q2. Commercial jobs vary in size but often are several megawatts. And we donât get a portfolio effect forecasting and a large construction job that gets pushed back affects megawatts in a given quarter but has limited impact on the underlying economics.
As Lyndon described Q4 2014 saw an acceleration in our deployment of residential megawatts which were up 110% quarter-on-quarter which is 98%, 109%, and 107% respectively Q1, Q2, Q3 2014. Our residential business track nicely our goal doubling every year. Our residential business built to continue scaling and we have a world class operating leadership team in our Vice President's, Directors, regional managers and crew leads which allows us to continue growing in existing territories and new geographies by promoting from our internal very strong bench.
Weâre also able to recruit the best talent in the industry given our differentiated vertical integration and the ability to have engineers sales teams and operational teams courting tightly around providing a better product to our end customers. Over to you.
Lyndon Rive
So our customers continue to scale, weâre now at 190,000 customers. In order for us to achieve our million customer goal for by mid-2018 we need to have a growth rate of 61%. Our current growth rate is 98%. We continue to feel good about achieving our million customer goal. That being said we did add fewer customers in Q4 than we did in Q3. Our business will always be seasonal in Q4. We just have less sunny days because of vacations.
But for Q1 we're off to a great start. We booked more residential bookings in the last 30 days than we have ever done in the past. And we expect Q1 to be one of our best quarters for new bookings.
Looking at our leadership position it has increased to 39%. Weâre currently larger than next 70 solar companies combined. One of the reasons for this increase in leadership position is we offer additional services. For example power guide. This allows our customers to monitor the production and consumption of the energy in the home. Pete will cover this in more detail but to my knowledge weâre the only company that offers this additional service at no extra cost.
Another reason why customer select SolarCity our mounting hardware is no rail, ecstatically looks better than any other system. When a customer is given a choice they prefer a system that looks better and often real-time monitoring on both production and consumption. These are some of the reasons our leadership position has increased.
Tanguy Serra
So this quarter we have continued driving cost out of the model. Installation cost are record low at $2.09 per watt. I would note that module price have been roughly flat throughout the period in this chart and the mix of commercial residential does not affect the cost reduction. The reduction in cost is truly focused on productivity. Our people are phenomenal and we work on providing them the best tools to enable them to accomplish more everyday driving labor productivity and utilization of our assets.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the men and women at SolarCity listening on the call for all the work they do. In particularly our East Coast crews battling adverse snow conditions and continue to install through a harsh winter. Our safety record is also at all high time high, truly proving that a 100% growth cost reduction and increase safety go hand-in-hand when done well with the appropriately cost and training programs. Our overhead on a $1 per watt is also continuing to go down despite continued investment in both software and hardware.
We are continuing to see massive demand for product and have been scaling sales and marketing up ahead of 920-megawatt to gigawatt year resulting in a slight increase in our sales cost on a per watt basis in Q4. Our goal of $1.90 ops cost is $0.19 away and we've got specific plans for each one of those $0.19. We look forward to starting manufacturing in New York and the plant is on track to open in Q1 2016. And Pete will talk about the results that our teams [ph] have accomplished in the lab in the meantime.
Peter Rive
I'm Peter Rive, Chief Technology Officer. Our technology investments fueled some great results and I would like to run you through some of the highlights. But first we release this peak which is about roof mounting system that consists of snaps to get parts to simplify installation. As we started using this we have seen inflation timelines go from 2 to 3 weeks, to 2 to 3 days. Additional it can also increase car capacity on roof buildings by 20% to 50% as a result of the it's dual orientation nature. So that's pretty exciting for us on the commercial side.
Then on the solar cell front, we have transitioned from 5 to 6-inch sales at our production facility in China which combined the recent advancements in cell efficiency our critical milestones in realizing our cost and efficiency goals at our Gigawatt factory in Buffalo at flow.
So it should be used to grid integration. Our strategy is twofold. First, every operational concern posed by utility. And second, show how distributed generation can lower cost of providing electric service in general. So first one, recently conducted successful test of high penetration solar circuit to give wide utility comforts resume interconnections without risking voltage issues.
On the second front we are engaged in pilots and product developments to illustrate the grid benefits of solar combining storage and load control all of which may represent additional revenue streams for us in the future. And as Lyndon mentioned our energy monitoring platform has been extended to include two important features.
First now include our power consumption meet with every qualified system and second provide we real-time access to power usage and solar production including cost and savings estimates. With this in place when you combine it with Energy Explorer which is our full-blown energy and usage analysis, I believe we provide the most transparent access for consumer energy information for any electricity provider in the country, not just solar providers but also utilities at large.
We've also made some great strides in improving the customer experience through software. We released our new app MySolarCity, and with this customers can now self-schedule their site visit which is not only more convenient but also lowers our cost as we now have about 40% of our customers self-scheduling. One of the coolest part of this -- features of the app is that one of the most annoying components of in-home service is the dreaded arrival window. When the cable company says they will be there sometime between 2 and 5.
To make it even easier to switch to solar, we now provide a Google app experience where we can text you the exact arrival time and give you the ability to follow our truck into your homes on a map. This is a pretty cool feature, but more than anything it's representative of our vision for simplifying SolarCity. We basically just want to remove all friction from the process.
As for storage, our investments in battery control systems are beginning to pay off as we are seeing increased traction of our DemandLogic products which allows us not to lower the energy portion of the customers cell, but also the demand charge. Our learning algorithms have been in place for over year and are working as expected, so this is an exciting area of growth for us.
Coordinating load, storage and solar to firmly shape peak power in this way is a microcosm for general good operations, so it's really important that we get this right. And I will hand it over to Brad to give a finance update.
Brad Buss
Thanks Pete. This is my first full quarter since I joined SolarCity as CFO in August, and it's been a busy one. With the launch of MyPower, the introduction of Solar Bonds, the closing of Silevo and a record for capital raises as well as our normal year-end and review which has gone quite well.
2014 I think was an amazing year for the Company, and I really believe 2015 is going to be better. If you look at nominal contracted payments remaining, it's a very good proxy for our projection of future revenue and cash inflows from energy contracts under management, and it also is the main input for retained value. I was really pleased to see the ending 2014 amount of $5 billion which represented a growth rate of 149% year on year.
Our retained value expressed in dollars is a strong indicator for the long-term value that is being created. And it's really not apparent from reading our GAAP financial statement, hence we are providing this key metric.
For FY â14 we increased our retained value forecast in dollars and excluding MyPower by 131% year-over-year, and we ended the year with a cumulative value of $2.4 billion. In addition to the introduction of MyPower, we added an additional $166 million of retained value, again calculated the same way that we do it for our leases and PPAs.
However since MyPower doesn't use tax equity, we decided to show it separately in the slides so as not to muddy the overall metric. In addition, we will be introducing leverage retained value as an additional metric in Q1, and I will take you through that later. Many investors look to the value of retained value per watt which is a good yardstick, but the quarterly mix of business between our categories as well as between states will move those numbers around a lot. And in Q4, we saw a commercial and military projects impacting our overall average but came in at $1.69 per watt.
We really are managing a very large portfolio of assets that's growing rapidly, and we really focus on the cumulative retained value dollars that we create over the course of a year. You can run your models as many of you do, and I think you will see a massive increase in retained value year on year. I'm going to go through a little bit of financial housekeeping as there were quite a few things that went on in the quarter. We introduced MyPower and got off to a very strong start from a bookings perspective. The financial impact for the quarter was minor but will grow significantly in subsequent quarters as the bookings turn into deployment.
I love having a loan product for people that want to own their system; however, the accounting is really not that straightforward. At a high-level the system sale will be capitalized as deferred revenue and ultimately recognized as customer payments are received over the life of the loan. The attributable system cost as well as variable cost will be capitalized as well and ultimately depreciated over the period of the contract.
In order for you to better understand this, I have prepared a primer related to MyPower that explains the product, all the accounting, and the high-level contrasts versus leases and PPAs. It is posted at the top of the events and presentations section of our IR website, and I encourage you to take a look through it.
Overall our GAAP financial results in Q4 came in largely as expected barring two items. First was the accounting for about $7 million in sales and marketing expenses that we had originally assumed would be capitalized in our guidance but was expensed due to the final terms of the agreements which required us to treat as period expenses.
Second was $6 million in other expenses that were not originally built into our guidance. Most of it is non-cash and was related to a contingent consideration adjustment related to our Silevo acquisition and a one-time write-down on a non-cash basis of capitalized financing costs related to a facility that was closed in Q4. If you exclude these items, GAAP results essentially came in line with our guidance.
Q4 was the first full quarter for Silevo to be included in our financials, and I wanted to add a little more color so you can judge the core business better. Silevo had approximately $1.1 million in legacy sales but benefited revenue, and however, they will not be repeatable on a long-term basis.
The impacts to COGS was about $5 million. It was split between the actual COGS related to the legacy sales and the balance being the impact of intangible amortization related to our acquisition. Thus we had a net impact to gross margin dollars of approximately $3.9 million which translated into about 6 full percentage points.
The impact to OpEx was $5.2 million, and that was mostly in R&D, and altogether about a $9.6 million impact to our net loss. CapEx was minimal in Q4 but will increase significantly throughout the year as we go about our manufacturing capacity.
The formula for retained value as we have always defined it has been our projected customer cash flows net of O&M expenses, less expected distributions to our tax equity investment partners and then discounted. It was created before we introduced ABS and AG facilities into our business model and as such, it's really an unlevered measure that does not reflect any project debt.
As we continue to pursue more back leverage through ABS and AG facilities and more importantly as we have a higher portion of our mix towards MyPower which does not use tax equity, it is important we develop supplemental measure that better captures the true equity value creation we are creating. Therefore, beginning in Q1, we will be introducing levered retained value and also continuing to report on retained value as we always have.
We hope that this new measure plus additional reporting related to the power component of our business that we will be providing will help you analyze and value the Company on a more consistent basis going forward.
We're putting a lot of systems and business processes in place to ensure that we can consistently report and audit all numbers. So look forward to more of that coming in Q1. If we turn to the GAAP operating statement, our revenue came in line with expectations with operating lease revenue up 120% year-over-year to $49 million. This was down versus Q3 due to the typical seasonality experience with lower solar production during the winter months.
Solar energy system sales revenue was $22.6 million and was generally comprised mostly of commercial sales. MyPower is being recognized in this line, but the revenues were negligible in the quarter but will grow substantially going forward.
Operating lease gross margins were 38%, in line with guidance and our seasonal revenue base. However, our solar energy system sales gross margins were a negative 17% and had a lot more noise in their than normal and included a $1 million loss from third-party Silevo product sales, about $0.5 million in amortization of intangibles, close to $2 million in period costs and a higher absorption of the overhead pool due to lower volumes.
In total our reported gross margin percentage was approximately 21%, and if you exclude the non-cash charges for intangibles and stock-based comp, we would've yielded gross margins of approximately 29%. OpEx came in at $135 million. It was higher than the higher end of our guidance really due mostly to the sales and marketing expenses that I discussed earlier.
We saw sales and marketing expenses grow 135% year-over-year to $79.5 million, and again if you take up stock comp and intangibles, the adjusted expenses were about $71 million. Much of this represents our accelerated investment in sales headcount at year-end as we prepare to ramp towards our 2015 guidance. And you're seeing the benefit of this investment in the bookings that Lyndon talked about earlier.
Sharp uptick in sales investments won't pay off in the same quarter, but just as we have experienced many times in the past, we expect this to yield a notable uptick in our bookings in the first half of the year. We are very focused not only on our cost per watt targets which as you can see we have done very well at, but also the absolute dollar spend and driving further efficiencies as we scale.
Also impacting our GAAP results this quarter was $6 million in other expenses that we have not guided to. And again, if you basically look at the non-GAAP items before the HBLV, we came in at $1.47. If you adjust out the $7 million of OpEx and $6 million in other expenses I described, you would've came in at around $1.33.
If we whip over to cash, cash and investments increased $65.6 million year-over-year, and we exited the year with $643 million in cash and investments. However, if you exclude the proceeds from equity option proceeds and the convertible, we consumed approximately $442 million for the year, again mostly to fund the rapid growth of the business and the investments in sales and marketing.
These expenses tend to lead to deployments and the resulting cash flow by three to six months. This consumption largely arises due to the timing of operating versus financing cash flows, and we are implementing some new financing facilities and working capital structures that will close this gap. And we have put together a slide on number 19 to give you a view of that.
I expect the cash will seasonally decrease in Q1 and increase in Q2 and Q3, and based on my current projections, I don't see the need to raise any additional equity to fund the business in 2015. As far as access to capital, the structured finance team has done an amazing job, our pipeline of tax equity funds has never been better, and we had a record 592 megawatts of un-deployed capacity leading into this call. You saw a bunch of very high profile transactions that we put up publicly, and stay tuned, you will see a couple more.
In addition, we launched the first financing facility for MyPower. It's an initial commitment of $200 million, it's a revolving facility, and we have built in capacity to increase that on very short notice. It was a great coupon at about 3% which is our lowest spread to date. And I think we are going to be filling that up increasing it pretty soon.
We've also been in discussions with the rating agencies for while on our next ABS. It's taken them a little longer than I had hoped as these structures include new tax equity structures that are different from our prior three issuances. As such they need to do extra diligence. I hope to have the process completed and be to market soon. The good thing is once this is complete, every tax equity structure that we currently are using will have been rated, and we will have a very easy and repeatable financing vehicle via ABS.
In summary, I think we are fully booked for financing for the year and I'm pretty excited what the sales and ops guys will be doing with all of that cash.
As far as guidance, you saw we affirmed our guidance for 2015 megawatts deployed of 920 megawatts to a gig. At the top end, this is more volume than we had done cumulatively in the last seven years of the Company's existence.
Beginning in Q1, we are going to give quarterly megawatt guidance based on installations, not deployments. The main difference is that installs are what we control and is the main metric that we measure output and efficiency against.
The difference between installs and deployment is generally the few days or week that it takes the local third party inspector to sign off on the permit, and at our size, it is beginning to be a sizeable task, especially near month-end and over holiday periods. We will report both installations and deployments quarterly, and we are keeping our 2015 guidance on deployments.
In addition, we have been impacted by commercial deployments for the last two quarters as you all well know. And as such we are going to include in future guidance only commercial contracts that are finalized, have been started in the quarter and have a very high probability of being complete and installed in the quarter. We hope that this will alleviate deployment guidance risk and not detract from the stellar job that we are doing in the residential market.
In addition, our guidance will be given as one distinct number with no range which reflects the bottom-up target we are driving the Company to achieve. While we are very sensitive to achieving our quarterly target, the slippage of some commercial projects and a day or two of weather can and will affect our quarterly results, but our overarching focus as a Company is on the yearly target.
Our guidance is detailed on slide 21 in our deck, and all winter seasonality as we currently know it is currently reflected in that. I'm very excited on where we are starting off 2015, and I'm looking forward to another record-breaking year.
With that, I will pass it back to Lyndon for closing remarks.
Lyndon Rive
Things Brad. Just to reiterate, I'm feeling good about 2015 based on the beginning of the year. We have large expansion plans. So we're going to be opening up 35 new warehouse, we're going to be expanding into new markets in new states. We're seeing great momentum in our commercial pipeline,. Even though we missed our forecast of commercial I am highly optimistic about this vertical.
We've essentially secured most of our project financing for 2015. And as mentioned earlier, off to an amazing start with bookings. And the last 30 days being direct residential bookings and expected to have a great quarter.
With that, why don't we open it up to questions?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Shen
I would like to start off by asking what kind of mix do see in 2015 between MyPower and lease?
Lyndon Rive
The mix will probably between 25% to 30%, somewhere around there of MyPower. It would be MyPower. Yes.
Philip Shen
Great. Looking ahead what's your sense of what out there may be demand for potential MyPower ABS offering?
Tanguy Serra
Thatâs definitely our plan. Obviously the first ups ops is going to be in our conduit that we talked about. And then our plan as of record right now would be to go to the ABS market shortly after.
Lyndon Rive
And it should actually be easy, there is no tax accrete structure in those assets.
Tanguy Serra
Correct.
Philip Shen
One my question for me and I will jump back in queue. It appears the CPUC may be reaching a preliminary decision soon on their tiered rate structure in California. Can you help us bracket the range of potential outcomes and also how might this impact your pricing if at all and how could this potentially impact incremental retained value per watt?
Lyndon Rive
We are heading towards essentially bringing up the bottom tiers and collapsing down the top tiers. That we actually think is going to expand our market opportunity. And we don't see the need to change our $0.15 price in California. So we still be well below the bottom tier. And so we are feeling fine.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.
Brian Lee
I had a couple. First on volumes, when I look at your attentional volume trajectory for hitting the 2015 targets, it would employ that there is acceleration in year-on-year growth rate in the back half of the year which is not what you saw in 2014, so wondering what's giving you the confidence and what might be different in 2015 that allows you to grow faster on a year-on-year basis in the back half versus the first half?
Brad Buss
The two main areas. One, we don't have any financing constraints so we can really push pedal to the metal. The next is the bookings is off to an early start. Last year the bookings came in a little later. So we've never had this type of bookings this early in the year. And so with those bookings, we feel confident we will meet those targets but to a point Brian, I want to mention is historically the first quarter is around 15%, 16% of our total volume. So it's not too far off that.
Brian Lee
I appreciate the MyPower breakout year. I was also trying to reconcile how that impacts the overall retained value to get a sense for how that metric trended on an apples to apples basis from Q3. I'm getting something close to about 65 per watt in incremental retained value on an all in levered basis so wondering if one, that's in the right ballpark and then maybe more importantly if you can just help bridge what the levered retained value per watt from MyPower might be so we have that transparency.
Aaron Chew
Why don't I tackle it because I have all the numbers in front of me. It's Aaron. You are in the right ballpark if you look at the peer lease PPA retained value excluding MyPower. And as noted earlier in Brad's prepared remarks it's really the downtick on incremental basis is really a mix issue. We had a huge commercial quarter relative to the last couple of quarters. As for the MyPower levered retain value youâre just going to have to wait a quarter, I mean I think if weâre ready we could have--
Lyndon Rive
So for MyPower we expect to see depending on the state that we are in expect to see around $2.50 to $2.80 a watt of debt and so then you subtract the remaining.
Brian Lee
Okay so if I hear that correct, it's $2.50 on the low-end of debt per watt and I think this quarter you had the unlevered 366 is that correct?
Lyndon Rive
Yes.
Brian Lee
Okay, fair enough. Last one for me and then I will pass it on we have seen some of your peers--
Lyndon Rive
Brian, let me just do further clarity because the stay variances are so big, unfortunately Iâve to give you a bigger range, it's probably closer to $2 to $2.80. It varies from state. California is closer to the $2.80.
Brian Lee
Last one for me I guess on the -- if I look at your peers in the distributed [inaudible] segment like Sun Edison and NRG in recent quarters, they both talked about dropping portfolios of [inaudible] assets into their respective yield code. Obviously you guys don't have one but I would be curious to hear your thoughts on where you are positioned in relation to those peers and if there are any company specific dynamics that might impact your ability to follow a similar strategy. Thanks guys.
Brad Buss
I think the main attraction is really a lower cost of capital. I think. As you can see and we continue to demonstrate with the MyPower is down up 3% we are able to drive some pretty attractive financing. But we don't see that as a main benefit right now, but I would never say never. We constantly look, the business as a whole, but nothing that would be on the horizon anytime soon.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar
A couple of them, one is on the MyPower side are you guys reading MyPower rates to encourage more people to go the lease PPA or is it a whole separate strategy?
Lyndon Rive
So we have adjusted MyPower pricing in California. But that's the only place that we have adjusted. We have adjusted it in February, early February we adjusted it. And we moved it from an interest rate of 4.5% to 5% to 4.9% to 5.4%.
Krish Sankar
Okay. And then second one, on the megawatt install guidance for Q1. Does this include some of the commercial push outs from the last quarter and also along the same path, Lyndon you mentioned how the bookings is off to a great start. Is it a way to quantify, would March quarter bookings be greater than the September quarter you had about 230 megawatts?
Lyndon Rive
Let me take care of the bookings one. And then Tanguy can address [inaudible]. So February at least the last 30 days has been our record residential bookings. If things go on track we should expect that Q1 will be one of our best bookings. It's hard to forecast, if some of the commercial deals don't close then it won't be the best, thatâs why I put it one of the best. But last three days we definitely are doing some good bookings.
Tanguy Serra
And the Q1 guidance it does include the megawatts that we had got to Q4 which will end up in Q1.
Lyndon Rive
Yes there was one project that was literally by a week.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Jobin from Credit Suisse.
Patrick Jobin
First question on retain value or incremental retained value. Just running the calculation here I'm coming up with a $1.46. I'm assuming that MyPower is not included in that retained value forecast, is that the right math and perhaps any color you can provide on what drove that or getting about 25% booking mix of commercial and maybe what was that in Q3 and what led to sequential decline? Thanks.
Lyndon Rive
So the number is actually closer to--
Brad Buss
No he is right, thatâs a broken down number.
Aaron Chew
You haven't really seen any major shift I think in a market by market basis or segment by segment basis. What youâve seen is a big shift in mix. So yes youâve a quarter [inaudible] incremental but the vast majority of that is just we had a huge commercial bookings quarter.
Brad Buss
Yes it's actually [inaudible] so challenge of those bookings we don't include any of the SREC this value in bookings. We do include the SRECs once the system is installed but we don't include any of the SREC value in the actual booking number and as you have a larger East Coast mix thatâs a big number. It's $0.03 to $0.04 a kilowatt hour, so you by [inaudible] it will artificially drag down the number. What does get installed we do it through SREC value.
Patrick Jobin
Okay so just to repeat that, make sure I understand perhaps five-pointish change in mix sequentially led to some of that decline and then also the mix shift geographically. Not including SRECs. So the incremental retained value if you did include SRECs for residential would be roughly flat sequentially is that -- am I hearing you correctly?
Lyndon Rive
So there is still mixes. You got to your mix straight, the mix of commercial and residential and military and then your SRECs, those main points. We haven't modified pricing. So if the numbers are reducing its because of the increase in growth in the new states. And actually I do want to kind of fit that exchange, as we expand into new states this year over this year, the likelihood -- it's a fact that the power cost or the energy cost in the states are lower than most of the current states weâre in today. So as we are able to reduce our cost we will be expanding to lock it and you can expect that the rates in those markets will vary from a to $0.08 to $0.11 a kilowatt an hour and initially the volume will be small but overtime it will add more volume.
Brad Buss
Just make sure you're clear Patrick, weâre answering this. So consolidated was down quarter and quarter incremental, really mostly a makeshift issue. Resi was slightly down but not on a bottoms up basis. There is no change on a market by market basis. That was more of a state issue which is compounded by the fact that not only would you get lower pricing in the Northeast but you don't get credit for these SRECs.
Patrick Jobin
And then my second question thinking about the levered retained value metric that you will roll out of '15. Think about how you're going to approach some of those inputs for that calculation I think historically have given in a slide deck $1.75 MPV per watt. I'm tried to reconcile this with the range of MyPower in the quarter which seem to be about $0.86 to $1.60 levered given a debt of -- think about that correctly.
And should we expect a levered retained value comparable to the $1.75 result historically? Who are getting the best answer to that is you have to rate it will give you that number we would reduce that right now. But the one thing I will tell you is your levered retained value is going to be lowered then your retained value.
Lyndon Rive
Normally I think it goes higher but obviously you've got to take into account the debt repayment because they're paying for all of our capital investment in the first place.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah
I guess first you mentioned that your cost of $2.09 our will have your of your target. Talk about your expectations for your cost of $1.90, your plan begins operations. Are you seeing any further improvements on the -- which would allow you to get to that are cost target?
Lyndon Rive
The $2.09 that was currently operating at is assuming is with current resi modules and with current price for inverters. If you -- and contract rates. If you roll that forward in 2015 your is probably better than MyPower [ph] but that she give you a sense of where we will end up excluding the impact of manufacturing your own panels. And then when you add to that manufacturing panels I think we will be in great shape in cost.
Brad Buss
Just to be more clear, the own cast of $2.50 does not include any effect of our manufacturing facility in Buffalo, so very to very little effect of it. When that is actually up and running the extra efficiency gain we will gain, our cost will come in lower than the $2.50. Thatâs all in 2018.
Vishal Shah
Right. But it sounds like you guys are ahead of your cost targets and of course you see very strong bookings in Q1. That said I would think your guidance of the year of 950 megawatt to a gigawatt would be very conservative. So it is your financing pass the word is it you don't want to go out and set new targets? What is it that was aligned, you guys are thinking about and not raising your guidance for the full-year?
Lyndon Rive
First thing 920 to a gig could be a lot worse. It is not easy thing to achieve. The foundation is incredibly solid, and we are on our way to get there. But I don't know, we are not going to increase that guidance. That is a good guidance.
Brad Buss
And let's be frank, right, we have got some guidance expectations, challenges whatever you want to call, we've had a lot of feedback on making sure that we don't get ahead of our skis, no pun intended, and I think like Lyndon said that's a big number right there. And what we would like to focus on this executing and managing to each quarter.
Lyndon Rive
Depending where it comes in, thatâs close to doubling and it's doubling big numbers now.
Brad Buss
Again, it's more than we have accumulatively done in the entire history of the company to-date.
Vishal Shah
One last question in terms of the bookings that youâre seeing right now. Are you seeing bookings from any additional states besides the ones that youâve talked about in the past given that your cost has come down and what's the mix between residential versus commercial bookings or between say East Coast or West Coast?
Lyndon Rive
In terms of new states, when we open up to a new state we actually do make a big announcement on that. We don't disclose the new state ahead of time. We only make announcement when we actually offer the service. So all these are within the state that we service today. In terms of residential commercial mix, weâre shooting for roughly a 80/20, maybe 15/85%, residential. And the bookings will fluctuate commercial bookings will be lumpy and then the breakups in East and West Coast we don't do a break up on that. We don't break out our states.
Vishal Shah
And maybe just a follow-up on that just to kind of drive home the point of peoples questions about their incremental retain value. The commercial share in 4Q bookings is a lot higher than that target?
Lyndon Rive
The bookings is lumpy.
Operator
Our next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok
Just a follow-up to Vishal's question, I guess two part first is in terms of commercial mix versus residential for the full-year. Any kind of change there? It sounds like maybe residential is stronger than commercial, there is lumpiness or youâre making it a little more conservatively. Am I listening to it correctly? And then in terms of capacity of doing gigawatts, do you have enough capacity or do you need to add more installation team or operational team?
Lyndon Rive
Commercially the pipeline is looking really strong. Weâre shooting for a 80-20 mix. Residential is growing and it's highly predictable and thatâs why Iâve handicapped commercial by another 5%. So commercial could come in around 15% to 20% but the benefit of residential, you get the profitable, the product it's highly predictable, and we feel more confident about that.
Brad Buss
Let me take the question capacity, the key is not to have the capacity of having the volume because that would excess costs. What you really want to have is built a machine that can grow capacity and thatâs what we have done. So we've got all the recruiting teams, all the training programs, they are lined up and built so that we can unboard and recruit people and then add that capacity and so to be able to do 920 to gigawatt in 2015 and then grow beyond that in 2016, so what really matters is the ability to grow the capacity at any given moment of time.
Edwin Mok
And then just a housekeeping question for MyPower. I guess too much question, first thing is what is the mix of MyPower versus lease in terms of bookings that you had in the fourth quarter, and then the first few weeks of this quarter. If they can do a commentary about this very strong bookings here. And you said that expenses related to MyPower will not be capitalized right? So it will flow through the OpEx. But in terms of the cost per watt metric that you calculate on the OpEx side, you are still baking in that expense pace on bookings than actual MyPower cost, am I understanding it correctly?
Brad Buss
I don't think all of that, under MyPower piece will capitalize the system cost and there will be certain sales related cost that will flow over the period of the contract.
Lyndon Rive
But to be clear in terms of our cost per watt, yes it does include MyPower, if thatâs what youâre asking fully baked. In fact look at our cost as we always publish it, the updated methodology to include MyPower is in there.
Edwin Mok
I guess my question is more in terms of timing right? Because previously your cost per watt is based on your booking not necessarily when you deploy.
Lyndon Rive
No our cost per watt is a GAAP number, so it's based on. I see the sales cost partially but I mean thatâs not the big driver compared to your install cost and the G&A. I don't think I understand your question, Edwin.
Brad Buss
The point is that it's treated the same as everything else. There is no nuance in MyPower in that as well.
Edwin Mok
And then just lastly quick question, there are some talks about ports right here in [inaudible] right, have you seen any impact on product supply, and potentially some near term on cost because you might be explain some stuff?
Lyndon Rive
Yes, weâre obviously monitoring the situation closely. We got [inaudible] a couple of minor items but if not our combination of our inventory and a good reroute to other ports in the U.S., to East Coast and freight stop across the country makes us very comfortable and I think the cost might add but it will not be noticeable in the dollars per watt.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Frank from Robert W. Baird.
Tyler Frank
Just a quick follow-up on the question about ports, is there a timeframe you would like to see this resolved and how should we think about that if this were to pursue for another month or so?
Lyndon Rive
Sure. The timeframe is as soon as possible, if you can do anything about it I would love your help. But again we manage the business on a assuming worst-case and assuming on a worst-case basis, we can as I say shift product into other ports in the U.S. and still meet our cost targets as well as megawatt deployment targets.
Tyler Frank
I think you said that you expect the manufacturing plant in Buffalo to be operational in Q1 2016. What sort of milestones should we look for and when you say it will be open then, will that be running at a full gigawatt run-rate at that point or how should we think about that?
Peter Rive
So two questions there, milestones and when do we achieve run-rate. Milestones, I think next big milestone is on the building actually being watertight and proof which -- the building is currently under construction, on track, things being great there the next sort of specific milestone, the building is dry inside and in Q1, 2016 is when we start capacity not when we reach full capacity.
Brad Buss
Moving equipment, it's moving equipment and actual capacity. The building will be ready in Q1, 2016, thatâs when we start moving in the equipment. We setup the equipment and then capacity starts coming out. But to be at full capacity, the forecast is in Q1, 2017.
Lyndon Rive
And ramp throughout the year. It is a very measured ramp of a big focus on quality and yield.
Brad Buss
But the price extension [ph] I would not expect any volume in Q1 of 2016. Weâre moving equipment at that time.
Operator
Thank you. We have one last question, our last question comes from [inaudible] from Raymond James.
Unidentified Analyst
First on the commercial sales, it's not the first time that you guys have faced this quarterly choppiness issue, given that and the fact that margins have been pretty poor, is that something you are perhaps looking to exit?
Lyndon Rive
No. We actually -- we like this business and we are designing technology that allows us to have the lowest cost structure and we think we can really scale, that space. Yes, there has been lumpiness, we will do a better job in our forecasting of it, but we are doubling down on the growth of commercial.
Peter Rive
I'm personally very excited about the opportunity to take cost out in the commercial business. I think it's a segment where everybody's cost in the industry are roughly the same and there is a true opportunity for significant differentiation in cost structure which will be a significant focus of ours and we are actually very excited about this space.
Lyndon Rive
And one another point that Peter mentioned is the time, so when youâre dealing with commercial customers the disruption is actually really painful for them to manage. And historically when you install a commercial system it takes full plethora commercial system, it takes you two to four weeks. With our new installation system we can do this now within two to three days.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay and then just a broader policy question if I may. We are seeing several states where there is a legal barrier against leasing. And there are efforts to try to reform that or abolish the band. Florida, maybe the most high-profile. Georgia is having this legislation. Yet are you guys involved in any of these efforts to change the framework and if not, are you still looking at it as an opportunity to get into some new states?
Lyndon Rive
Yes. So it's not essentially the lease, it's lease or PPA. Essentially it's third-party owned systems and the policies are in place essentially to prevent competition from occurring in the market. So are we involved absolutely? And we will carry this type of change wherever possible. We feel it's important that consumers have a choice and that they have a choice of where they want to get their energy from. And if you look at any of the states, those that the states that don't have third-party allowed, the volume is really small. And I think you might see a change there, and weâre active there in helping support the change, but thatâs not tied to our expansion plans. That would be additive.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.
