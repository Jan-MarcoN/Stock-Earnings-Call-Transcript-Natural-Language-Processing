James E. Craddock
Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us this morning. We're now less than 2 months away from closing out the year and gearing up for 2014. First 9 months of this year has passed very quickly and we've accomplished much during that time to prepare for continued success going forward. The third quarter provided another period of record production volumes and notable events as we executed on our development plans across our core areas.
Let's review our list of key accomplishments for the quarter. We saw an all-time high in both daily total equivalent production and in daily oil production. We recorded sequential Eagle Ford daily equivalent production growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. We successfully executed our first operated horizontal well completion in Southern Reeves County of the Delaware Basin and we added a fifth rig to further expand our development activities in the Delaware.
Now let's go through the quarter highlights in more detail. Total daily equivalent production for the quarter was 50,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 37% from the same period 1 year ago and up 4% from the second quarter. Oil production was 15,200 barrels of oil per day, a 38% increase versus last year, and a 25% increase compared to the second quarter. Oil production in the third quarter represented 30% of total equivalent production.
The oilier mix reflects higher contributions from our assets at the Dubose lease and the Karnes Trough and from the Permian. We achieved 33% year-over-year and 3% sequential growth in our Eagle Ford production at 48,500 BOEs per day. Eagle Ford production has grown for 15 consecutive quarters and remains on track with our growth projection. The third quarter was our first full quarter production contribution from our Permian assets. The Permian produced 2,200 BOEs per day, comprised of 84% total liquids, including 75% oil. We are behind on where we had planned to be on our Permian production. We've been on a steep learning curve here over the past few months and while we've probably gone a little slower than originally anticipated, we feel that we are now ready to pick up the pace, especially as it relates to horizontal activity. John Clayton will provide additional color on Permian operations in his remarks.
Our total production through the first 9 months of 2013 is higher by 41% versus the same period 1 year ago. We entered the fourth quarter set to deliver our solid operational and financial performance for the year. Another significant third quarter accomplishment was the completion of our first operated horizontal well in Reeves County. The Balmorhea State 32-15 'A'1H horizontal well tested at
[Audio Gap]
who's [ph] been closely monitoring the progress. Recently, one of the best horizontal Wolfcamp wells drilled to date in Reeves County was completed directly offsetting our acreage. Needless to say, we're thrilled about the horizontal potential in the area. Based on the accelerated amount of horizontal well data, we are moving forward with our horizontal well program. We added our fifth rig in early September and operations are currently underway on our first operated horizontal well that we've drilled in Reeves County.
The well was spud in early October and completion operations are planned for early December. A sixth rig will be added by year end, with plans to spud 2 additional operated horizontal wells in 2013.
In the Eagle Ford, we continued our development activities with operations on the majority of our leases in the quarter. Nine Briscoe Ranch wells were completed in the third quarter. The wells were put on production on October and will contribute to fourth quarter volumes. In the Karnes Trough area located in the oil window, Dubose lease has been fully developed with the final 6 wells placed online in early August. Development is also moving forward on our Tom Hanks, Central Dimmit and Lopez leases.
As you read in our earnings press release, we did provide fourth quarter 2013 guidance ranges for production and expenses and refined our capital guidance range. We expect to spend between $870 million and $900 million of capital for the year, excluding acquisition capital. We are estimating our fourth quarter average daily production guidance range at 54,000 to 56,000 BOEs per day and we expect to exit the year at 57,000 to 59,000 BOEs per day.
We're in the final stages of preparing our 2014 budget for release in early December. We plan to operate 5 to 6 rigs in the Eagle Ford and 6 rigs in the Delaware Basin. We are expanding our Reeves County horizontal program in 2014 with 4 rigs dedicated to drilling horizontal wells. The vertical well program will continue as well in the near term, with 2 rigs allocated to holding acreage across our Permian basin lease position. We will also maintain our pursuit of asset acquisitions in and around our 2 core areas. We're excited about the horizontal potential on our Permian assets in Reeves County and look forward to updating you on our progress.
In summary, our main focus continues to be the successful and efficient execution of our Eagle Ford and Permian development plans as we move forward into year end and into 2014.
Now let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide a summary of our financial results.
John E. Hagale
Thanks, Jim, and welcome, everyone. As a reminder, all the information I'm reviewing today is contained in our 10-Q, as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC yesterday and are available on our website.
Net income for the third quarter was $41 million or $0.67 per diluted share, versus net income of $18 million or $0.33 per diluted share 1 year ago. Adjusted net income, non-GAAP, increased for the quarter to $62 million or $1.01 per diluted share, versus $0.76 per diluted share in 2012. For the third quarter of 2013, revenues were $195 million, compared to $123 million for the same period 1 year ago. Third quarter revenues, including realized derivatives, were $227 million in 2013, compared to $158 million 1 year ago. Year-over-year increase in revenue was due to higher production and higher average realized oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by lower NGL prices.
Third quarter revenues from oil sales, including realized derivatives, increased 51% to $137 million this quarter from $91 million in 2012. Oil production increased 38% over that same period, along with a 10% increase in the average realized oil price when you include realized derivatives. Third quarter average realized oil price excluding derivatives was $100.41 a barrel, up $7.59 from the second quarter average of $92.82 a barrel. The sequential increase reflects the higher LLS prices for the quarter. As I stated during the second quarter call, our realized oil prices influenced heavily by changes in LLS, and for the fourth quarter, I would continue to guide you to an average realized price for us, company-wide, of LLS minus $11 to $12. Taking a look on the cost side of things, we had a 21% increase in the DD&A cost on a unit basis versus the second quarter of 2013, again a 10% increase from the same quarter 1 year ago. We signaled this in our unit DD&A expense on our -- this increase in our unit DD&A expense on our second quarter call. The higher expense is due to the addition of our Permian assets to the full cost pool.
Net G&A on a unit basis in the third quarter, when you exclude stock-based compensation, decreased by 10% versus the second quarter of 2013 and 17% compared to the same quarter 1 year ago, but you should remember, the second quarter of 2013 net G&A expense was higher than normal due to the inclusion of $1.2 million of transaction costs associated with the Permian acquisition.
Interest expense for the quarter was $0.21 lower, compared to the prior quarter on a unit basis -- to the prior year, based on a unit basis. Sequentially, interest expense per unit decreased by 50%. As I mentioned during our second quarter call, interest expense during the second quarter included a one-time fee of $5.6 million for the bridge credit facility that backed up the Permian acquisition.
As most of you have seen, this morning, we launched a $450 million debt offering. We plan to use the proceeds of the offering to repay the borrowings outstanding under our revolver and for general corporate purposes. I should probably note here that the interest expense in our guidance in the press release does not reflect today's announcement, as we put that out yesterday and then launched this morning. John Clayton will talk about our lease operating expense later in the call.
Our expense guidance for the fourth quarter 2013 was included in the press release and is outlined again on Slide 5. I want to remind you that we will continue the practice of providing annual guidance until we get to the fourth quarter, when we'll actually give you the fourth quarter guidance. Overall, the fourth quarter guidance ranges are trending slightly higher than the third quarter on a unit basis. Of note, DD&A and expense and production taxes, both of those will be up in the fourth quarter. DD&A is up, expected to be in the range of $13.45 to $14 per Boe, and is higher due to our Permian assets being included in the full cost pool, but it remains within the previously disclosed guidance.
Fourth quarter production taxes will be slightly higher than this quarter, primarily due to the fact that we had some tax credits in this quarter related to some prior periods.
Regarding our hedging activity, we continue to remain active in the hedging program, adding derivative positions to our production as a part of our effort to mitigate our exposure to commodity price volatility. During October, we executed additional derivative transactions for crude oil swaps in 2015 and '16, and natural gas swaps in 2016. A detailed summary of our derivative position as of October 31 is attached to the press release.
Finally, on the financing front. As of September 30, we have an outstanding balance of $275 million on our revolver. At the -- after the end of the quarter, we completed our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination and our lenders reconfirmed the borrowing base at $800 million. As of November 5, we had drawn $310 million on the revolver, with $490 million available to draw.
Now let me turn the call over to John Clayton.
John D. Clayton
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will update you on 5 key topics: first, our operational performance and activities for our company; then, our key activities and highlights for the Eagle Ford; followed by key activities and highlights for the Permian; I'll then cover our 2013 capital production and expense guidance; and I'll end with a preview of our 2014 activity levels.
Now let's review our third quarter operational performance. As Jim mentioned, we've enjoyed another record quarter for total production, as well as oil production. Capital spending for the quarter was $262 million and we drilled 43 gross wells and completed 33. Our average daily production for the quarter was 50,900 BOEs per day, up 37% from the prior year. Total Eagle Ford production was 48,500 barrels of BOEs per day, up 33% from the prior year and up 3% from last quarter. The third quarter total production rate includes 15,200 barrels of oil per day and 18,000 barrels of NGLs per day. Oil production increased by 38% versus third quarter 2012 and increased by 25% when compared to second quarter oil production.
Overall liquids production for the quarter represented about 65% of total production. Oil production was 30% of total production, flat to last year, and up from 25% in the second quarter.
As Jim mentioned, the Permian production volumes of 2,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the third quarter did lag our earlier expectations. Nevertheless, keeping in mind that we took the property over on October 1, I'm pleased with the progress that has been made in getting this asset up and running and, most importantly, how we now are positioned for future development, both vertically and horizontally. The primary driver of the lower production numbers for the quarter was significant downtime in older wells associated with multiple rod failures and significant tubing failures. Since taking over operations in August, we have made adjustments to both the drilling and production engineering designs of the new wells to minimize this downtime going forward. Even when factoring in the near-term Permian delays, our total production growth trends over the last 3 years remained strong, as shown on Slide 7 in the presentation. The chart also highlights production for the current quarter, our fourth quarter guidance estimates and our projected exit rate.
Now let's talk about costs. In the third quarter of '13, direct LOE totaled $13.3 million, a 41% increase over last year on an absolute basis. Approximately $1 million of the cost increase is a result of the Permian operations, with the remainder primarily due to increased Eagle Ford operations. On a unit basis, third quarter LOE increased by 3% to $2.84 per Boe when compared to the same period last year. Sequentially, third quarter direct LOE was 14% higher versus the second quarter result of $2.49 per Boe, again, a result of the additional Permian assets.
Now let's step through a few of the operational highlights for the quarter. In our Eagle Ford core area, we operated 5 drilling rigs, mostly at Gates Ranch, Briscoe Ranch, Central Dimmit and the Tom Hanks area. We also completed 20 wells. I'll expand on our activities as I briefly discuss each of our operating areas in the Eagle Ford.
Let's begin with Gates Ranch. We continue to develop the Eagle Ford at Gates Ranch on 55-acre spacing, or 475 feet between laterals. We have seen no indications of interference. During the third quarter, we only completed 5 wells at Gates Ranch, and the number of wells drilled, yet awaiting completion, increased from 18 to 28 due to our move on Gates Ranch to 4-well and 6-well pads, which further improves our efficiencies. We also continued to monitor the performance of 2 Upper Eagle Ford pilot areas shown on Slide 8 of the presentation. Although it is still too early to provide any updates, the plan here is to understand whether or not we are effectively completing the Upper Eagle Ford and, possibly the Lower Chalk, through a singular lateral wellbore that has been drilled in the lower part of the Eagle Ford. Keep in mind that there are some of our assets located in the play where the Eagle Ford is roughly 250 to 350 feet thick. What we are testing here is how to best maximize the value of the assets that have this thicker Eagle Ford section. We will continue to monitor these upper wells, we will test a few more pilots as we go forward and we will report out when the data is meaningful and conclusive.
Let's move on to Briscoe Ranch. As I mentioned on the second quarter call, we implemented our Column Development Program. Late in the third quarter, we began completions on the first set of wells drilled under the Column Development. Those 9 wells, highlighted on Slide 9 of the presentation, were placed on production in mid-October and will contribute to fourth quarter production.
Now let's move to Central Dimmit. During the third quarter, we drilled 2 additional 7,000-foot laterals on our Vivion lease and both wells are now awaiting completions. We also drilled the seventh well on our Light Ranch lease, which is also awaiting completion at the end of the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we plan to drill our first Upper Eagle Ford test on the Lasseter & Eppright, or L&E lease, as part of our first 3-well pad. Similar to Gates Ranch, both Briscoe Ranch and the most -- and most of Central Dimmit assets have this thick Eagle Ford section that we are looking into and trying to understand the proper spacing, both laterally and now vertically with Upper Eagle Ford pilot programs.
To close out the Eagle Ford review, let's cover a final update of our Karnes Trough area. During the third quarter, the final 6 wells on the Adele Dubose lease were completed and placed on production. Both leases in the Karnes Trough area, the Dubose lease and the Klotzman lease are now fully developed with 25 total wells on production. Karnes Trough wells are oilier than most of our Eagle Ford portfolio and we have a net revenue interest of slightly over 71%. The total average cut for the area in the third quarter was 70%, and the total liquids cut averaged 87%.
Next, let me update our Permian activity. Since we took over operations on August 1, the Permian team has made excellent progress in ramping up our Permian Basin operations. During the quarter, we increased from 4 to 5 operated rigs in Reeves County. The fifth rig was added in early September and we will add a sixth rig by the year end. We drilled 14 vertical wells and completed 12 vertical wells. We also completed our first operated horizontal well during the quarter, the Balmorhea well. In Reeves County, Rosetta successfully completed the Balmorhea State 32-15 'A'1H horizontal well. The well was completed with 16 frac stages across an effective 5,500-foot lateral length. The well was drilled with 6,900-foot lateral length, with plans for 20 frac stages, but due to operational issues, 4 stages were not completed, resulting in approximately 1,400 lateral feet not being stimulated.
The Balmorhea is located in the center of our acreage position and it is shown on Slide 10 of our presentation. It was drilled to the Upper Wolfcamp zone by the previous operator, and we took over this well prior to it being completed. The well was brought online in mid-August and tested at a 24-hour gross IP rate of 1,323 BOEs per day, of which 87% was oil and 5% NGLs. The 7-day gross-stabilized rate was 969 BOEs per day, of which 85% was oil and 5% NGLs. But most importantly, the 30-day gross-stabilized rate was 737 BOEs per day, which was 83% oil and 6% NGLs.
Needless to say, we're very pleased with the results of our first operated horizontal well completion, especially given the fact that our original completion design was cut short by 20%.
On the second quarter call, we announced our accelerated plans to spud our first operated horizontal well by the end of the year. We have spud this well, the Gaucho State 15-2, and we have plans to keep this rig line busy, drilling horizontal wells across our acreage. The well was spud on October 5 and completion operations are now planned for early December.
We continue to monitor, participate and obtain data on horizontal well activity in and around our Reeves County position. Based on the industry and partner results we're seeing, we now plan to spud 2 additional operated horizontal wells before the end of this year, which means our sixth rig coming into Reeves County, scheduled for next month, will be assigned to horizontal drilling as well. The planned locations are shown on Slide 10. Based on this increase in operated activity, as well as industry activities, we have now updated our project inventory to include an additional 611 gross operated horizontal well locations, assuming development on 660-foot well spacing across a high-graded geographic area for Bone Springs, Wolfcamp A and Middle Wolfcamp benches.
Although our views of this project are subject to change, as we obtain additional data, Slide 11 in the presentation is a map generally showing our operated and non-operated positions in Reeves County.
Slide 12 is a map of our current plans for horizontal development in the area. Needless to say, although it's early, we think we are in a pretty good area for horizontal development.
We are also proceeding with our plans to test vertical spacing at true 40 acres and also true 20 acres. The true 40-acre pilot area includes 6 wells spaced approximately 1,300 feet apart. All 6 wells have now been drilled, with completion dates scheduled this month. Our plans are to monitor the completions with microseismic, as we test different completion designs throughout the large vertical section of reservoir rock. The true 20-acre pilot area will include 5 wells in a 5-spot configuration, spaced roughly 930 feet apart. Drilling is scheduled to begin in December with completion dates immediately following. Data gathered on these true spacing patterns will allow us to understand not only which portions of the 2,500-foot hydrocarbon column is contributing, but also how the fluids flow laterally throughout the rock. Knowing the answers to these questions will help us spot our vertical well take points and allow us to optimize the proper placement of our lateral wellbores in those development programs as well.
We expect to drill 14 gross operated wells and complete approximately 16 gross operated vertical wells in the Delaware Basin during the fourth quarter, along with the completion of our second operated horizontal well. We will also continue to seek opportunities to acquire and expand our lease position.
On the non-operated side in the Permian, we continue to participate in both vertical and horizontal wells. In the third quarter, we've participated in the Tycoon 2501H, a horizontal well in the northeastern portion of our lease position. This well offsets the Tycoon 1804H well that I mentioned on a second quarter call, and it also offsets the recently announced Bodacious #1H well. Currently, we are also participating in drilling both vertical wells and vertical well workovers.
Let's now review our total inventory picture. Slide 13 is a table of our total company inventory as of the end of the third quarter. With the addition of the 611 gross operated horizontal well locations in the Permian, we now have adjusted the well count for vertical well locations downward. This was done since horizontal wells now have taken the place of some vertical wells that will most likely not be drilled.
Finally, let me close with a few comments on our guidance for the remainder of this year and a preview of our activity levels for next year.
As John mentioned, our guidance is reported in our earnings press release. We did refine the 2013 annual guidance range for capital and provided fourth quarter guidance ranges for production and expenses. Excluding acquisitions capital, our 2013 capital guidance is expected to range from $870 million to $900 million. We expect fourth quarter daily production to range from 54,000 to 56,000 BOEs per day and we are on track to exit this year, producing in a range of 57,000 to 59,000 BOEs per day. We have also provided expense guidance for that quarter.
As I mentioned on previous calls, the most notable change to our cost structure is the impact of the acquisition on increasing our direct LOE, primarily due to higher operating costs associated with the Permian Basin assets. Fourth quarter direct LOE is expected to average between $3 and $3.15 per Boe. Next year, in 2014, Rosetta's operational plans will include allocating roughly 6 rigs to continue to horizontally develop our Eagle Ford assets. Two of the rigs will most likely be dedicated to Gates Ranch and we will likely keep one rig dedicated to Briscoe Ranch. The remaining 3 rigs will be split between our Central Dimmit County assets, our Tom Hanks lease and finishing up our Lopez lease.
In the Delaware Basin, we will also operate 6 rigs throughout the year. Of the 6 operated rigs, 4 of them will be allocated to drilling horizontal wells. The remaining 2 rigs will be allocated to vertical drilling, either necessary to hold the leases intact or to test concepts such as well spacing and/or which pay intervals are contributing and which ones are not. These factors will aid in the overall development of the entire asset, including optimizing our horizontal programs geographically across the play.
With all that said, we are finalizing our 2014 plans and we will announce our approved 2014 capital budget in a press release early next month. But I did want to provide you guys with some color on how we were thinking about next year, which should be another exciting one for our company.
As always, I thank you for your interest in our operations. And with that, I will turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, John. I hope our remarks this morning have provided additional perspective on our third quarter results and plans for the remainder of the year.
We built a significant momentum during the first 9 months, which will drive our performance through the end of the year and into next year. We have well-positioned core areas in 2 of the most active plays in our industry, coupled with a strong track record of production growth and operational execution. We like our current opportunities set and look forward to delivering competitive results next year.
As always, I'd like to take this time to thank Rosetta's technical and business support teams for their continued enthusiasm and effort over the first 9 months of this year. I'm proud of the effort that we've put forth as a company and I look forward to continued success for our team.
I'll now turn the call back to the moderator so we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Gabriele Sorbara of Topeka Capital Markets.
Gabriele Sorbara - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
I like the plan to transition to a horizontal program in the Wolfcamp. It's a bit sooner than I expected. Can you talk about your comfort level and your confidence there in the transition?
John D. Clayton
Yes, Gabriele. This is John Clayton. When we started out early on, there was -- I think there was 100 rigs running in the Delaware side, drilling horizontal wells. And then a couple of months ago, we started having -- I think, it was 16 horizontal rigs that were drilling horizontal wells in Reeves County alone. I think the big driver behind this on us accelerating it is we've got some more production on our Gaucho well. And then we started, although very minor, minor small interest, we had started working interest in some non-operated properties. We have an interest in the Tycoon well and -- I just think the data coming in so fast. It's -- the wells that we have -- we haven't published the type curve on the Wolfcamp A bench yet, but we have one internally and it looks like, at least early on, and I will give the caveat, it's very early in the play. These wells, are going to perform at or above the original type curve that we've got internally. We'll need more data before we make that public, but the economics associated with the horizontal, especially the Upper Wolfcamp bench, look extremely favorable now, although it is early on. It also allows us to have more reservoir that's available for the high-return properties if we start early in the play on the horizontal drilling. But I think if we were in it ourselves, we would be taking it a little longer but I think you know the people that are in our zip code, and they're getting quite a bit of data, we're getting pretty good data, and it will be a competitive play going forward. But I think the well results, by industry, in the northeastern part of Reeves County is proving out to be pretty positive, especially in the Wolfcamp A bench. Now we've got our eyes set on the Lower Bone Springs bench, as well as some other benches in the Wolfcamp, not further down in the section, but maybe in the middle of the Wolfcamp that we think also offer us some opportunity, but I think the Wolfcamp A bench right now is what's leading us to accelerate. Keep in mind, though, 4 rigs next year is probably going to put us at about 25 wells. So if you look at the size of our acreage position, it's a very, very small dent in it compared relative to what we believe the running room is. So that's a long-winded answer, but it is a competitive play out here and the results in the Upper Wolfcamp are pretty favorable. And I think it's no secret to the people that are in Northeast Reeves County that the wells are turning out pretty good. So anyway, appreciated the question.
Gabriele Sorbara - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
Yes, I appreciate the color there. And then just if you can comment on what you learned from the Balmorhea well. And if the completion method is getting tweaked here on these upcoming wells that you have planned?
John D. Clayton
Yes. So we originally planned 20 stages and I'll give you a kind of a 30,000-foot look of it. Early on, 1 of the 4 stages that did not get pumped was a surface problem on location during the job. The other 3 were screened out. We've got -- when we pump these jobs, especially on important wells for us, we've got our completions engineers out on location. So we were actually able to make some adjustments on the screenouts early in the pumping of the job that actually was changed and we redesigned, on the fly, the latter completions in that well. So not only will we use the new designs on some of the wells going forward, but we made some completions on the Balmorhea well, itself, by changing fluid and concentrations to pump those jobs off. One of the 3 was mechanical, the other 3 were screened out, but we changed it, on the fly, and we pumped the other 16 away.
Operator
The next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Some good color already on the Perm, if I could just delve [ph] a little bit on that. As far as downspacing opportunities and initially, early on, sort of your thoughts about the targeted formations. I know, obviously, versus the one that you have mentioned in the press release.
John D. Clayton
Neal, this is Clayton. You're talking specifically Permian?
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Yes, sir.
John D. Clayton
Okay. So this rock is 2,500-feet thick, and if you drill down just a little bit further than that, what we've got is a highly overpressured rock that starts in the third Bone Springs, which we call lower Bone Springs. And the lower Bone Springs' pressure regime is very similar to the Wolfcamp pressure regime. So if you busted up the 500-foot you could put it in 2 camps: one, which is a higher overpressured, which starts at the third Bone Springs and goes lower; and then there are first and second Bone Springs that cover 1,000 feet of gross rock that's less pressure and the hydrocarbons in there are interbedded with some sands and reservoirs that actually have water. And so the key to that is going to be how continuous are the hydrocarbon-bearing zones and how continuous are the water-bearing zones and how do you optimize the completion in there? So if I started from the top, we have not yet tested the Avalon. And then we start testing, and we have started testing First Bone Springs and Second Bone Springs. And our issues there are how do you maximize the number of completions to target just the hydrocarbon-bearing zones and minimize the ones that are more water-wet? So we can ascertain on logs which ones are, but when you frac these wells, we're tweaking completion designs to try to stay out of the water. Then you move into the lower sections, which are more overly pressured. They have less water in the rocks and we can get a little more rougher with it. But when you start looking at production from Third Bone Springs and Wolfcamp, we're still recovering low, low recoveries compared to what's in place. And so now we're trying to figure out what's the vertical drainage radius of that? So what we're going to look for in of these pilot programs is can we see communication by reservoirs between the wells? And I would expect they're going to act different because they're in different pressure regimes. And then how do we tweak our fluid and sand concentration on the completions in order to increase the drainage radius by reservoir? I don't think it's out of the ordinary that you'll have some rock in that column that will drain 5 acres and you probably have some rock that will drain as much as 40 or 60 acres. And that's going to help us a lot to determine how we space these wells going forward. We've complicated it a little bit now because we're pretty -- I want to put a caveat. We're early in the horizontal play, but we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in the upper bench of the Wolfcamp. And if you take that out of the vertical wells, then how do you complete it? Because that's a 300-foot interval in the overpressured section that we might not complete on all the vertical wells if we're drilling horizontal nearby. So it's a lot more complicated than trying to understand the spacing in the Eagle Ford, because we are only dealing with 300-foot of rock and it's all the same pressure. Here we're dealing with 2,500 foot of wet rock. It's different reservoirs, different lithologies and the pressure regimes are different too. So we may end up with 6 or 7 plays in this thing before it's all said and done and then figuring out which ones are most commercial vertically. And that's kind of how we're looking at it.
Neal Dingmann - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division
Okay. Great color, John. And then one, just a follow-up in the same area, if I could. Just your -- I know it's very early here. Just your thoughts on depletion there. I know on the Balmorhea you've put out kind of like the 24-hour IP and then 30-day growth-stabilized rate was. Is that a trend or how should we kind of start factoring this? Kind of -- I know, obviously, there's been a number of peer results not directly next to you, but in general area yet, should we assume just sort of the general decline? Or your thoughts on that?
John D. Clayton
Yes. These wells are going to have a steep decline component to it, most all these shale plays do. And I know, Neal, you've got an appreciation for that because you follow quite a bit of plays. We obviously like 30-day rates better than 7, and we like 7 better than 24. But as we move through time, we'll be able to figure out what the final exponential decline is. It's too early for me to -- which is why we haven't published our own type curve externally, but we have to watch that hyperbolical part of these wells break over and more move into an exponential-type decline. High 24-hour IPs, and I'm speaking personally, and I think I can speak for our technical teams, they just kind of tell you, "Did you get off an effective stimulation?" The rock mechanics and the fluid flow through the matrix of these rocks really are more indicative of what's the well doing later on when you produce these wells. And that's a lot more important to figure out the commerciality of them than having a peak rate. We also -- we started this in the Eagle Ford 3 or 4 years ago too. We flowback our wells on a constant choke and so we put our wells on a constant choke and we tried to then get a better understanding of fewer variables, which is if you keep the choke size the same, then you can watch pressures decline and rates decline, as opposed to as the rate declines opening up the choke. And so we don't do that either. We started that practice about 3 years ago in the Eagle Ford and it gives us a better understanding of it. But I think it's safe to say, we are very pleased with the 700 and whatever it was, 30 or 40 barrels a day, 30-day rate. And we put less emphasis on the original IP.

The next questioner is Welles Fitzpatrick of Johnson Rice.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
In the Reeves, obviously, the black bar [ph], it's moving a little bit south there. Are there any plans to push your drilling further west, southwest of the Balmorhea in the A interval in the near term?
John D. Clayton
Yes. Well, this is Clayton again. I think if you look at that map and I'm not exactly sure what page it's on, I think maybe it's on Page 11. The -- or maybe a better one to look is on Page 12, which is where we have the inventory. We have other acreage that moves to the west and some a little bit to the southwest. This is the area -- there's a lot of work that went into this map other than putting the sticks on a map. Our team, since probably January of last year, have been working the sub-surface rocks on this, even prior to closing on it. These are areas that we believe have, from a risk standpoint, pretty good potential in either the Lower Bone Springs, Wolfcamp A or Middle Wolfcamp benches. So in '14, I would not look for us to drill our 25 horizontal wells all grouped together in the absolute best area of the reservoir. I would look for us to act pretty similar the way you've seen us act in the past, is to spread those well tests out throughout the entire area on here that we've high graded, which is indicated in the areas that have sticks on it. So, yes. If you look to the west of the Balmorhea well, we believe there's opportunity there, and I would probably look for us to test that to some degree. As you move further west, in where we put sticks, we have less and less data. Even if you move to the northwest, we have less and less data. So we've tried to high grade this on this map. So look for us to get a good delineation test through our next year's program.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
That's great. I appreciate that. And can you remind me how much of the Reeves is HBPed? And with you guys focusing a little bit more on horizontal versus vertical drilling, is there any concern about Pugh Clauses or will the 2 verticals handle that pretty well?
James E. Craddock
Hey, Welles. This is Jim. Really not much of a -- what we call HBP right now. But most of the leases have continuous drilling clauses in them and I think what we've said in the past is we think a couple of rigs is sufficient drilling verticals wells to hold all the acreage together. And kind of as a reminder, we see a role for vertical wells here, especially in the early years of this play. Not only can we hold acreage, we can hold acreage down to the deepest zone that we complete those wells in. And then also as we move around and delineate these things horizontally, if you look at our Eagle Ford practices, we typically had to drill a vertical pilot hole first, plug back, kick off. Here we can use these vertical wells as data points to get knowledge about the depth of the zones and the dip and so forth. And the final thing I'll say is they're commercial and they make money. And so there will be a role for vertical here for a few years as we hold the acreage together, delineate it and get our arms around how many benches here work and so forth.

The next question is from Ipsit Mohanty of Canaccord Genuity.
Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
If I could focus on something a little specific and then go on to a broader question. Your Permian production for the quarter, you bought -- you completed 12 out of the 14. How many of them were actually put online? Because they didn't show up in the production for sure.
James E. Craddock
Was the question how many of the 12 wells in the Permian were brought online in the quarter?
Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
That's right.
James E. Craddock
Okay. So we completed, excluding the Balmorhea well, you're right. We brought 12 wells online in the quarter. I don't have the exact timing of it, but I would think they were spread out through the entire quarter because we try to keep a pretty consistent pace on our development. So I would say they were spread out through the quarter. I don't have the actual schedule in front of me.
Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Got you. And then -- sure.
James E. Craddock
Not all -- the only other thing I would add to that is, unlike the Eagle Ford, we don't average 100% working interest out here as well. So we've got varying working interest. I think, on average, we're in the 2/3 working interest, 65-or-so-plus percent on working interest as opposed to the Eagle Ford where everything we operate is, essentially, 100% working.
Ipsit Mohanty - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Got you. And then just looking into your march into the horizontal Wolfcamp and associated production ramp up going into '14. How confident are you with the infrastructure around you and in terms of managing operating costs associated?
James E. Craddock
Yes. The good news on this, although we've got infrastructure to move wet gas and product to market, is I think on the Balmorhea well, the 30-day rate was north of 80% oil. So even though it's -- it could be a good ramp up, we have the ability to truck the crude and so the limiting factor on this unlike maybe some of our gassier Eagle Ford assets where you have to have a midstream come in there and move the product, we have the option here which is trucks. So once we start getting some type of scale to the magnitude of the program in the well results at Reeves County, in general, then we can start being more efficient and get our transportation costs down by putting in physical pipe to get everything to market.
Operator
The next question is from Brian Corales of Howard Weil.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Another one on the Permian. Have you all participated in any horizontal wells not in the Wolfcamp A? And then do you plan to test next year some of these other Wolfcamp benches or Bone Springs?
James E. Craddock
Yes. So the answer to your first question is, the wells we participated in are all Wolfcamp A. Now we've got the operator that had the property before us, although they drilled 2 Upper Wolfcamp wells, the Gaucho and the Balmorhea, they also drilled 2 Wolfcamp C wells, which is in the lower part of the Wolfcamp, and those weren't as successful. Now to answer your second part of the question, in '14, our plans are, of the 4 rigs running, to get a couple of Bone Springs tests and that's the Lower Bone Springs, which has got the higher pressure. And then there's some intervals in the middle Wolfcamp that our technical guys are pretty intrigued by as well. And so, yes, we will test things other than Wolfcamp A in 2014. When you say those reservoirs, Bone Springs, Wolfcamp A, B, C, it seems like they're all in close proximity. But these benches are 300 feet-plus a piece. So there's lots of separation between them. So it's a little different than the Eagle Ford play or the -- let's say the Bakken, Sanish, Three Forks play. We're talking about benches that are hydrocarbon-prone, that are a couple thousand feet between.
John E. Hagale
Yes. And, Brian, I would just -- I guess I would just add, kind of, based on your question, a reminder that we have said before that how we behaved in the first 3 or 4 years of our development of the Eagle Ford, especially Gates Ranch, is probably a pretty good indicator of what we anticipate doing here. And that is, as Clayton had said earlier, the initial phase of this thing, 2014, will be probably pretty widely spaced horizontal wells, testing the viability of these zones. There will be tests in other benches. And then there probably will be, fairly early in this thing, some spacing pilots too, on horizontal, to see how that behaves as well. So if the Eagle Ford is any indicator, we'll do that for 1 year or 2. We'll learn a lot about how the rock works and then we'll be into more of a pattern-development mode after that.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
And no one has asked about the Upper Eagle Ford and it doesn't sound like you're truly ready to talk too much. But can you -- I mean, it's my impression that it's almost you need to start drilling, the sooner the better, for proper spacing and development, not going back and taking wells offline. Is that something that's a '14 event or early '14 event? Or do you need more production history and maybe a '15 event?
John D. Clayton
It's a great question. And so let me kind of tell you how our actions have been. So we've implemented 2 pilots in 2013, both of which were on Gates Ranch. So we did one on the east and one on the south. And the one on the east has been on now for probably 6 months. And what we're trying to compare is what's the lower wells producing, relative to our type curve and then what's of the upper well producing relative to our type curve and relative to the lower wells. So that's where we are today. We are drilling a third pilot, which will be our largest yet, at Gates Ranch, but it's still a pilot. So we're still gathering data. And, I think, in my script I talked about we're going to have a pilot at our L&E lease. And then our Briscoe Ranch is obviously in the thick part of the Eagle Ford as well, so I would probably look for us to have a pilot there very soon in Briscoe Ranch. So I think the determination would probably occur sometime in '14, but we still have a couple of pilots we'd like to test. And that also not only lets us test that, but it bides time on some of the wells we're watching that have now been on for as much as 6 months. So your original thesis, though, is correct. It's -- our belief is the quicker you make the decision, the more efficient you are when you start drilling wells in the same pressure regime than if you wait and have to go back in later and drill between them, you've just got a different rock stress below you that could affect how effective the stimulations are. But I think you're thinking about it the same way we are and our goal is to make that determination probably in '14, as opposed to push it out past that.

The next question is from Jack Aydin of KeyBanc.
Jack N. Aydin - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division
A question -- looking at the Permian, the $8 million, $8.5 million well cost, what kind of lateral length you're using and how many stages you're planning? And with that, what did you learn from the Balmorhea well. In terms of frac-ing, what they did, what you did?
John D. Clayton
Jack, this is Clayton. So the $8 million to $8.5 million can get us anywhere to 6,000 to 7,000 feet, that type of range. And drilling is not the high-cost deal it's the number of stages. So that's at about 20 stages on the completion side. If you also look at the sticks on Slide 12, you've seen we've quantified the inventory on about 5,000 to 5,500-foot well spacings, which is almost per section. That's not ultimately how it will play out. As you know, in the Permian, this is a plan that allows us to operate all of those locations that are in red here. If we extend out the lateral to 7,000 feet, we start bringing in other operators into the well. And we don't have a 100% working interest in all of these yellow sections that we operate, and sometimes it changes who operates that well. So we had a question earlier on, I think -- I don't know if it was Gabriele or Neal that asked it, on why move so early? It is competitive out here and operatorship is something that's very important. Moving onto what we've learned a little bit, as you start frac-ing these rocks -- screenouts are not always bad. You want to place the fluid in -- I think, in an ideal situation, you would screen it out right at the end. And that means, you're getting permeability through the rock. But we will go through a learning curve real similar to what we did in the Eagle Ford on what's the proper fluids and viscosities we need to pump in the sand concentrations to place these fracs. We do not have microseismic yet on the Gaucho or the Balmorhea, but that's something we plan on doing on other wells to get a better understanding of the frac geometry and we'll try to optimize it. Craddock mentioned something a few minutes ago on well spacing, and I think the Gaucho [ph] and the Bodacious well -- the 2501 Tycoon well, excuse me, in the Bodacious well, those are going to be spaced fairly tightly and we'll be curious to see how those interact. But as we move through, we're also going to test what's the proper spacing. And initially, we had to pick something like we did in Eagle Ford. We're picking 660 [ph] on this, but we'll test that and it could be tighter, and it could be a little less dense. So we haven't obviously learned it all, but we learned enough on the 3 stages we screened out to get the other 16 away, but it's not that easy and we're still going to be fine-tuning everything for, I would say, a few years to come.

We have time to take one last question from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
I wanted to touch on, I guess, both basins real quickly. One on the Permian, the 4 rigs, 25 well counts, is there any desire, from a CapEx standpoint, John, to run faster than that? That may be restrictive based on the current balance sheet that maybe midyear, you find some more money somewhere to ramp that up past 4 rigs?
John E. Hagale
This is Hagale, and what I would tell you is our CapEx program is not -- we kind of like what we're doing. We're working on next year's budget, but we're not constrained by our ability to raise capital.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
So the 4-rig count is you're preliminary number and we'll see where we go from there as to how early '14 results pan out?
James E. Craddock
Yes. This is Craddock. I guess what I would say is we've laid out a program that the -- as, kind of, notionally, how we see development in the Wolfcamp, primarily the Wolfcamp A. As Clayton had said numerous times, it's early days. We're pretty excited about what we've seen. We don't want to get too far out over our skis though. And so we're going to -- we're not going to signal at this early date that we're going to go faster than that. I don't think that would be a good idea. So we wanted to provide the 4-rig count to give you, guys, some idea of kind of where we're headed. And, obviously, plans can change but, right now, we don't see any reason that we would change that.
John D. Clayton
Brian, this is Clayton and I'll add one thing to that. And I'll brag a little bit about our drilling guys. Not too long ago, with the rig activity in Reeves County, it was taken from spud to spud. So I mean, there's some -- since these wells are being drilled as single wells per location, there is some tear down and move time associated with it, but it was taking about 60 days for industry on these lateral wells. I'll knock on wood here, but the operated well we're drilling right now looks like we're going to cut 25% off of that time. So we've got the 4 rigs scheduled tied to about 25 operated wells. But if we are able to drill these things in a lot quicker time, which the first well is on pace to do that, you could come up with 36 wells in a year. And I don't think that's the message we're sending, but I think we kind of like the 25 wells in a year, it gets us to spread it across this asset here. But we are drilling that first well pretty darn quick right now.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
No, that's great color. And then on the Eagle Ford, you mentioned the 2 downspacing wells that you've finished, you mentioned a few others that you're planning. And I know that ultimate decisions won't be made until you feel like you have enough data for development of one section or all sections. Are we're going to get any sort of read on the initial 2 when you feel like you have enough data from those particular wells? Or are we expecting, or I guess, not expecting data until you have more complete tests of multiple properties with a handful of wells before we get results on what the ultimate decision on whether downspacing is going to be successful or not?
John D. Clayton
Brian, the simple answer is yes. We'll provide data. If you look back at how we handled the 55-acre spacing work that we did at Gates Ranch, about 6 to 9 months into those programs, we began providing cumulative production of those wells versus the offset wider-spaced wells. And we would anticipate doing a very similar thing here. And so I would say, we're still fairly early on these pilots, but I would say sometime midyear or so, next year, we should have enough production data, we should start providing that to you. So you should be able to see something on that.
