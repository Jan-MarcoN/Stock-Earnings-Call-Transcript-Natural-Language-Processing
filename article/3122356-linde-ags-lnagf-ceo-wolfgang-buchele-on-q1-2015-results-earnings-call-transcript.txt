Dominik Heger
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results for the first quarter. We are aware that a number of chemical companies are reporting today and will therefore try to keep the presentation brief.
Today's call will be hosted by Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO.
I will now hand over to Georg Denoke.
Georg Denoke
Thank you, Dominik and also good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome from my side. I will start with a high level summary of the developments in the first quarter of 2015 on Slide 3. 
We realized an increase of revenues by 8.7% to EUR 4.4 billion, and an increase of operating profit of 9% to EUR 1.01 billion. As expected by all of you, the weakening of the euro against many currencies had a sizeable positive impact on the reported development of revenues and operating profit. However, the macroeconomic environment as well as the uncertain political situation in some countries remained challenging as in the last year.
Therefore on a currency adjusted basis, revenue was 0.8% below last yearâs level and operating profit was 1.2% lower than last year. The gases division contributed to the sales and operating profit growth, while the development was in average negatively affected by the engineering business. Being independent of industrial production the healthcare performance came in with very strong growth. The group margin was stable with 23%, the operating cash flow in the first three months of this year was 24.6% above the level of last year. With EUR 1.69, our EPS before non-recurring item was 8.3% above the level of last year. Non-recurring items of EUR 20 million are included in reported EPS. For the full year, we expect non-recurring items of around EUR 90 million. 
I would like to move on to the development of revenue and operating profit by division on Slide number 4. As just outlined, the exchange rate effect turned in our favor. The revenue development of the gases division benefited from this effect and grew by 9.1%. In the engineering division, the revenue development is dependent on the progress made in different projects in this respective quarter. In the first three months revenues of EUR 668 million were realized.
On the right side of the slide you will see that the gases division generated an operating profit above EUR 1 billion, the margin improved by 40 basis points compared to last year. The engineering division realized an operating profit of EUR 57 million. As expected due to a change in the project mix, the margin came in at 8.5% in line with our guidance of around 8%.
I will now move on to a more detailed review of the performance in the gases division and start with Slide 5. The positive currency tailwinds from the weaker euro of 9.9% were moderated by headwinds from natural gas prices of 2%. On the basis of an unchanged definition of comparable growth price and volume increased by 1%. Please be aware that comparable growth was negatively affected by a couple of factors, including the expected end of contracts, lower LPG prices, and the repeal of the carbon tax in Australia. Adjusted for these additional effects, comparable growth would be 1.4% higher and in total 2.4% above previous year.
Please note that this figure is not adjusted for the lower pass through of electricity costs. I would like to go through the comparable growth and adjustments for additional effect on Slide 6 and review the product areas. In cylinder, comparable growth in the first quarter amounted to minus 1.8% versus the first quarter in 2014. The development was negatively affected by a slower growth environment in the Asia Pac region by lower LPG prices, hence the repeal of the carbon tax in Australia.
Excluding the [latter two aspects] comparable growth in cylinder would have been minus 0.4%. So on a similar level as Q4. [Pipe] revenues increase slightly by 0.7% on a comparable basis as economic conditions in the southern hemisphere, specifically Australia, South Africa and Brazil remain challenging. Here too growth was affected by lower LPG prices. Excluding this effect, comparable growth in [pipe] would have amounted to 2.7%.
Continuing to on-site, comparable sales in this product area declined by 0.7% versus previous year quarter as growth was restrained by the end of contracts. Excluding the effect from the end of contracts on-site would have recorded a comparable growth of plus 1.1%.
Last but not least the healthcare product area recorded strong comparable growth of 6.9%, driven most significantly by volume growth at Lincare. Growth in healthcare also developed nicely in all other regions. This demonstrates the resilience of the healthcare business and the independence of the macroeconomic environment. I would like to continue with revenues by operating segment on page 7.
Revenue in EMEA declined by 1.6% on a comparable basis, primarily due to an end of contract in Italy, as well as persistently challenging economic environment in Africa. Adjusted for the outlined additional effects, revenue was stable. We continued to experience positive growth in the Middle East and Eastern Europe in the first quarter. By product area, the highest contribution to growth was from healthcare.
In Asia-Pac, comparable growth was 0.9%. Adjusted for the negative effects of lower LPG prices and the repeal of carbon tax, comparable growth in Asia-Pac was close to 4%. The South Pacific region continued to be impacted by negative economic trends. Additionally, we experienced a deceleration of growth in some selected Asian markets mainly Thailand and Malaysia.
In the Americas, reported growth increased 18.1%. Underlying growth remained strong at 5.2%. The development was supported by the solid performance of the North American business, most notably by Lincare. Meanwhile the economic climate in Brazil continued to deteriorate, further rationale for our ongoing restructuring measures there.
Proceeding now to operating profit by operating segment on Slide 8. Operating profit in EMEA rose to EUR 441 million in the reporting period corresponding to an operating margin of 30%, mainly due to higher contributions from the UK, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. In Asia-Pac, operating profit increased by 12.5%, reaching EUR 252 million in the first quarter with a margin of 25.4%. The positive operating profit development in Asia-Pac was supported by China.
As for the Americas, operating profit increased by 21.2% compared to last year totaling [EUR 315 million]. This resulted in an operating margin of 25.2%. The improvement in margin was mainly driven by our North American business. 
Let us now take a look at the engineering division performance on the next page, page 9. As outlined earlier in line with the project progress, revenue was 4.7% below the level of last year. The realized margin was 8.5%, as expected in line with the guidance of around 8% for the year. Due to the current low oil price many customers have postponed their investment decisions for new projects, in particular in the petrochemical industry. This has reflected in the lower order intake of EUR 280 million in the first quarter. The order backlog of EUR 4.5 billion remains on a very high level and gives visibility for the next two years.
After outlining the performance of our divisions, I would like to move on to the financial performance on the next slide, which is Slide 10. As already mentioned at the beginning, the cash flow from operating activities continued its positive trend in the first quarter, rising by 24.6% to EUR 740 million. The development was supported by the improvement in EBITDA. Net debt remained stable at EUR 8.2 billion. While the increase in EBITDA led to a decrease in the net debt to EBITDA figure from 2.1 times at the end of 2014 to 2 times at the end of the first quarter of this year.
I conclude with the outlook on the next slide. We confirmed the 2015 outlook. This means that depending on economic trends and exchange rate movements, we anticipate to achieve in 2015 revenues in the range of EUR 18.2 billion to EUR 19 billion, and operating profit before non-recurring items between EUR 4.1 billion and EUR 4.3 billion. In the same timeframe, we are seeking to achieve the return on capital employed of 9% to 10%. Also depending on economic trends and exchange rate developments we target to achieve in the gases division revenues of EUR 14.9 billion to EUR 15.4 billion, and an operating profit between EUR 4.05 billion and EUR 4.25 billion.
In the engineering division we plan to generate revenues between EUR 3 billion and EUR 3.3 billion with an operating margin of around 8%. We also confirm our medium term targets for 2017 of group operating profit being between EUR 4.5 billion to EUR 4.7 billion and return on capital employed of 11% to 12%. Please note that these targets are based on exchange rates prevailing from when the targets were communicated at the end of October last year.
I also confirm our HPO targets of gross cost savings of EUR 750 million to EUR 900 million in the four years from 2013 to 2016. Additionally, the organizational refinement measures should deliver around EUR 100 million to EUR 120 million savings by 2016. 
Thank you for your attention and interest in Linde and we are happy to take your questions now. Operator you may now poll for questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions] The first question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark
Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. I will restrict myself to two questions. The first one, Lincare obviously very strong growth again, it looks like high single digit, just want to check it is not dilutive to the Americas margin anymore, and hopefully moving towards being actually being accretive as that margin is coming up anyway? And then the second question in terms of the on-site business, you mentioned in the text quite a lot of projects ramping up, I know you have more impact from this as the year progresses, but just wondering what the impact with the ramp up effect was in the first quarter and what you expect it to be for the full year, perhaps as a percentage of gases sales or something like that will be great? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you Peter for your questions. I think it is a right observation that Lincare is accretive to the margin of Americas overall and it is a very strong volume development and of course there is no effect of competitive bidding to comparison in these numbers this year and therefore the full volume effect comes through. So, it is a positive confirmation of what we told you in August 2012 when we made that acquisition.
On the on-site business, as you know from the year end call, a little bit more than six weeks ago, I think we do have the negative end of contract effect, which is coming through more or less the full-year of 2015 and I was cautious also to guide in growth in on-site with this effect of about 1%. If you exclude that, of course, you have in the different quarters positive ramp up effects probably from around 4%, when you only see ramp ups and start-ups together. But that is not coming through. So therefore the development in on-site will be affected by these end of contract plus, of course, we also have negative pass throughs for electrical energy, which is here also not adjusted.
Peter Clark
Sure. So for the full year you would hope that could contribute about net 2% plus start-up ramp ups?
Georg Denoke
No, I think it is a â 
Peter Clark
Gross, I mean gross, not net, it is actually gross, so that is before obviously you have the direct effects elsewhere?
Georg Denoke
Yes, I think I tried to be a little bit more concrete here. I think my number was more 1% when I would adjust for electrical energy.
Peter Clark
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Sebastian Satz of HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Sebastian Satz
Thanks very much. I have two questions please and the first one is on the margin in Asia, where you have seen a decline compared to the fourth quarter. Now what I thought the effect of LPG should have been accretive to the margin, so could you just explain why you are seeing that decline there? The second one, a little bit more of a longer term or top down question, and I hear what you are saying on all the one off effects and the impact to your comparable growth, but if I look at the full quarter moving average, your organic growth has been trending down basically constantly since 2011, what will make that turn again, in other words, when and why will we see growth accelerate again? Thanks very much.
Georg Denoke
Now, I think this is the story which we repeated last year if I start with your last question, it is both in â13 and â12 â â13 and â14 we started with high expectations in the macroeconomic forecast, and these were reduced quarter by quarter. That was visible in our numbers and it is eating into the especially merchant performance. We have this year different effect as you know, I mean the macroeconomic forecasts are more positive because of the reduction on the oil price, which has a positive effect on â or an assumed positive effect on installed capacity for certain customer groups, but at that current stage as you know, you have seen a rather soft chemical development plus a very soft [field] development, which are also important drivers for variable contribution in the on-site business overall.
And then you have seen I think a slight deceleration and that brings me to your first question in selected markets in Asia beside South Pacific, which is continuously not coming out of the performance gap because of the mining sector and the manufacturing industry, which is supporting that as you know. So here we have two additional effects which is Thailand and Malaysia, which has been very soft on manufacturing and as you know from previous calls also here the [Indiscernible] has not disappeared at that stage. Therefore that was an important growth driver for Thailand in the merchant business for many years.
Sebastian Satz
And sorry, just to follow up on the margin that is explained by Thailand and Malaysia then, but has it changed compared to the fourth quarter, that is what I am looking at?
Georg Denoke
I think it is the first time that weâre communicating here an deceleration in these two markets and that has an effect. I mean Malaysia is also a cylinder market as you know for us. It is a strong foothold, and therefore that has an effect on the margin.
Sebastian Satz
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Mackey, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Mackey
Thank you and good afternoon everybody. Yes, I suppose I got three questions. One is a bit of an extension of questions there, if you strip out the natural gas and, implied pass through effects for LPG and the carbon tanks, which I think totals about close to EUR 100 million. That should have actually boosted your group margin by about 80 basis points.
So I was just wondering if you could perhaps expand your discussion on the margin effect a little bit more globally, you have obviously talked a little bit about Asia Pacific. I didnât know if there were any other impacts elsewhere that we should be aware of. Secondly, I wonder if you could in the cylinder business, in light of, the LPG pricing in particular, or spot pricing in LPG, do you think that the cylinder business is likely to turn to positive growth for the full year, and maybe, at which quarter do you think you might actually see sort of annualization of all of those effects and see some underlying performance in cylinder, and then the final question, I wonder if you could just remind us or update us of guidance on full year CapEx reconciliation EBITDA and interest costs and particularly if anything has changed given the currency moves? Thanks very much.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you Peter for your questions. I think first of all I think it is a over statement with the LPG adjustment of 80 basis points margin dilution. I think when you look on the group level, the main part comes from the drop in the engineering margin because gases over proportionately delivered growth. Also when you adjust for currencies. So this is a group margin effect from â and Linde Engineering perspective here and a deceleration of revenues and margin against the previous year quarter.
Peter Mackey
I apologize for my poor use of language, I really meant if you combined all of the pass throughs including natural gas?
Georg Denoke
Okay. 
Peter Mackey
And the effect on the gases business globally, apologies?
Georg Denoke
Yes, okay, but nevertheless what you donât see on the group level from a margin enhancement that is true even if you package all effects together. That is pretty much even up by the engineering performance, which we expected on lower margin this year. And we guided for an 8% margin, and we have seen a certain deceleration in the sales at that stage because of this very short-term impact of oil related to the calendar year, also now in the first quarter. so that is something which can let us say improve when we look into the future over the course of the year, but I think we are not too bullish on the first half for engineering on 2015.
So that is I think [a point], and when you ask when is â when are these effects eaten up, then I think it is really according to the calendar year. So, the end of contract more or less started at the end of quarter four and will remain in that performance comparison until more or less the fourth quarter, mid of fourth quarter next year, oil price effect depends, but this is more or less a strong decline as the currency also strongly declined â improvement from a euro perspective when you compare that when they started more or less really mid of the fourth quarter last year when you take the euro dollar exchange rate as an example.
So let us say that we are more positive for these effects overall in the second half of the year, but these are effects which are not disappearing easily when you take that. We nevertheless did not adjust the [comparable] growth because I think it will be a part, which will be next year different again, and then this is an different contribution. So from that perspective we isolated these effects, but we didnât want to change here the basis for [Indiscernible] growth.
When we move onto cylinder, yes, there is of course depending on economical developments in the different end markets, there is the plan that the second half of the year as more contributions in Linde as well as in biogreen you have the strong effects than merchant overall, industrial merchant is positive, right and also pricing when you add that pricing was positive even more than volume. So, when I isolate industrial merchant then Iâve an effect where you have 60% coming from pricing and 40% only coming from volume on a low basis, I agree that. But, I think thatâs important and thatâs adjusted for the LPG prices and the repeal of the carbon tax.
I think this is important when you look into the isolated pricing performance in merchant. And so, the hope is definitely that comes through stronger in the second half. Healthcare will remain for the full year on a very high level which means strong growth in this performance level of the first quarter and in some quarters probably even ahead and then we have said onsite already. So that is a mix effect which we see here over the course of the year.
Peter Mackey
Thanks very much and just those guidance issue, are you able to give us some clarification here please?
Wolfgang Buchele
I think we keep what we discussed that was around 400 million for the financing effect and CapEx I think is depending on how you see this, we had an 13% CapEx sales ratio guided, we had 2 billion depending on currency also of course that can be a little bit lower than 2 billion, but it has not changed compared to our guidance six weeks ago.
Peter Mackey
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Tyler, Redburn, your line is now open please go ahead.
Neil Tyler
Thank you, good afternoon. Couple of from me please. Firstly, I think in your commentary going back to the merchant liquid market you mentioned that in Europe that was still declining, I thought that better stabilize more. Could you talk a little bit more perhaps about geographies and markets to the extent youâre able to? And then, secondly, around the acquisition that youâve made in Australia, I recognize in absolute terms itâs relatively modest, but if you could outline perhaps strategically what youâre planning to do in the LPG market in Australia in the context of everything else thatâs happening in that economy at that moment? Thank you, Iâll leave it at those two.
Wolfgang Buchele
So Iâm kidding, weâre hoping for strong winter in Australia of course when you talk about LPG there, overall I think itâs an improvement of our strong footprint in the merchant LPG business in Australia which is an strong foot forward for us and thatâs a positive contribution. Itâs up curve from a margin perspective not on the same level we as industrial gases, but itâs in strong combination especially on the merchant business composition of our Australian business which also includes some [heart ray] as you know.
So from this perspective I think itâs dependent on the CP prices of course, but it has a stable consumption line which is stronger as you know at the end of the second and third quarter because of the southern hemisphere and the winter there. Therefore I think itâs been a phase in acquisition here to strengthen the footprint. It also was reviewed by Anti-Trust Authorities and it came through with some disposes because of our market position also.
When we then look into the merchant performance I think the difference in Europe is that by NPGP pricing is slightly down and you have to see in EMEA and that is my comment there is another big piece of LPG in South Africa and that also is of course here trailing down from an sales visibility prospector. And therefore, volume perspective was slightly positive in EMEA both in bulk and in PGP.
Neil Tyler
Thatâs helpful, thank you. Just going back to Australia and the contract acquisition, you expect to be able to extract any meaningful cost from combining that business and add that to what you already achieving in the region?
Wolfgang Buchele
Yes, thatâs true itâs an really â itâs an facility driven business case where you take over the sales of that player which we bought and then you consolidate the sites in that activity of LPG>
Neil Tyler
Great thatâs very helpful, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley, you line is now open, please go ahead.
Paul Walsh
Thanks very much, good afternoon everybody. I had two questions please. My first question concerned returns on invested capital. On my crude definition of invested capital just like in net debt pensions and equity as you reported it, it looks youâve seen a 7% increase in your invested capital base since the end of last and underlying EBIT in the first quarter was up about 5%. So, it looks to me like on a last 12-month rolling basis at least, returns have actually hedged down and I know there are numbers of facts impacting the invested capital with currency etcetera on pensions. But, I just wondered if you could shed some light on what you can do to try and reaccelerate the returns profile and whether or not actually what Iâm saying is true.
And my second question was just on the FX comments pertaining to the guidance, I think the comment was the guidance is still based on FX rates as per what it was originally installed. Does that mean you see upside risk to it or is it just a simple case of currency frankly itâs been offset by other factors hence why the guidance is unchanged. Iâm just trying if those having in the back pocket because obviously in Q1 itâs kind of just consistent with your full year guidance irrespective of currency?
Wolfgang Buchele
Yes, thank you for asking that one Paul. I think itâs very important. Weâve not changed that based on the first quarter development of exchange rates. As you know weâve that question also when we presented our full year figures for 2014 and I said there is upside in the basket of currencies at that point in time about 100 million to the guidance. It has not changed for the full year, I think currency came through a little bit stronger than we thought but nevertheless I mean, when I only look into the U.S. dollar or Euro exchange rate development over the last two days that can change past as you know.
Therefore, weâre not pointing that out, but we also wouldnât assume that itâs beats us even up by other effects when this comes through â during the year of 2015, I think that still is right there.
Paul Walsh
So, we should automatically assume that youâre being conservative?
Wolfgang Buchele
I think itâs really that no one knows and therefore it didnât increase yet and we do not want to confuse you and start a currency rally because the underlying competitive growth was not too strong in the first quarter as you have seen.
Paul Walsh
Sure, sure, okay.
Wolfgang Buchele
Then on the first question when we talk about that I think it is mainly at the [indiscernible] I think when you do the calculation then you have to understand that significant parts of our goodwill are related outside Europe and that has a stronger swing on the base of the balance sheet or the capital which has been negative for us from this perspective.
Overall, I think weâre working heavily on our operational performance through the refinement of the organizational footprint as we have on the productivity improvement and also HPO. Itâs on track in this quarter and overall we are slightly ahead of the gross cost savings for the plan until 2016.
Paul Walsh
Would you agree with the math that returns because of that increase in invested capital on the balance sheet in Q1 actually return dig down a little bit in Q1 but that will be caught up in coming quarters.
Wolfgang Buchele
Honestly, I think this is rule of thumb calculation what you here presented and I do not want to confirm that because itâs too high level but overall I think what I would like to point out our midterm ROCE [indiscernible] is in further enhancement to our performance in 2015 and have to be and I think this is the point so here more things are coming through as you know, we have an increase even until end of last year on assets on the construction from $1.7 billion to $2 billion and also that become on stream over the years. So I think from a valuation perspective the long term improvement is for us is very important and therefore we do have that midterm guidance for ROCE.
Paul Walsh
That's very clear. Thanks guys. 
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Klein, Berenberg. Your line is now open please go ahead.
John Klein
Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two left. First of all for bulk LPG can you give us a bit of indication on how pricing structure works on automatic pass-through of energy cost if you have contracts for let's say three year contract or five year contract in the bulk part that is affected by LPG pricing and then second question is on working capital can you maybe walk us through you had there is $200 million change in payable can you give us a bit of a detail how that happened year over year, thank you.
Wolfgang Buchele
For the contractual situation as you know on the 15 years basis onsite contracts do have these indexation and pass-through for electrical energy, for natural gas, for index inflation these kind of things. Therefore this is on 15 year basis the case and I think the biggest pass-through which we â
John Klein
Sorry to interrupt, but I was actually referring to the power part to that. Sorry.
Wolfgang Buchele
Okay. When you only refer to bulk then you normally have 5 years contracts, three to five years contracts not all of these contracts or I would say less than half of these contracts are passed through electrical energy and therefore you don't have that by definition where you have the trend being more aggressive coming through its in the CP pricing for LPG because that's very visible and here you have certain indexation which is coming through a little bit stronger.
John Klein
That's very clear. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander, Jefferies, your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Laurence Alexander
Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. First on your restructuring targets are you viewing them as a percentage of sales or in which case you would adjust them for currency effects in different regions or are you just thinking about in your terms and secondly can you update trends in bulk pricing outside the LPG particularly in North America and thirdly any update on your asset swap discussions?
Georg Denoke 
Yes. Thank you. I think from an perspective of the refinement of the organization of course we look always into the local currency because this is what and where the change happens, but look the number is not that high that you have an aggressive swing and itâs also balanced from a footprint perspective when we talk about the refinement of this is more in Americas and less in Australia so that's pretty balanced that there is talk about two dimensions one is restructuring which is more in southern hemisphere as we talked about the performance of South Africa, Australia and South America, the Brazilian operations whereas the rest of â organizational model which is more balanced against the operating segments. And of course, with the different underlying assumptions for growth when you have an emerging market of course you have an higher assumption of growth therefore you have the ramp-up of sales people according to additional capacity coming on stream on these kind of stuff. So we do not adjust that on a currency basis because the impact, itâs not too aggressive on the currency and we have when we are communicating these numbers we have applied already stronger foreign currencies compared to Euro.
When we come to your second question, on North America especially regarding the bulk pricing component that was stronger than the volume development so we have probably more than two times more price than volume effect there. On the asset swaps, I think there is no update. We can give because we haven't given a detailed overview but as I always had I think this is the market which is highly consolidated so you have in the first aspect you need someone who wants to tangle with you and you do not probably want to sell only for cash because you want to swap and get other contributions to come stronger through the combination and the second one is Anti-Trust if it too sizable then also it will become very difficult. So we are nevertheless confirming that we are entertaining certain activities but I would not over expect here the effect at that stage.
Laurence Alexander
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Thomas Gilbert, UBS your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gilbert
Good afternoon. I have got two and half questions. The first one this maybe a perception but in terms of investor relation releases on new projects when project wins on site gadgets it feels like itâs gone a little bit quite specially relative to the major competitor and I am also sort of painfully missing the slide on stream CapEx by on stream date. Could you just talk a little bit around the gross beyond the current start off and ramps new wins and how the 16 and 17 growth profile for tonnage looks like at the moment? Is there less business -- portfolio opportunities of your share wins your risk event or risk taking attitude on that end?
And then coming back to Paulâs question can I just clarify the 2017 guidance was set as of conditions of the capital market in October while the 2015 guidance was set as for the full year is that my correct assumption, just separating those two guidance please and when they were set what assumptions were used in terms of the currency? Thank you.
Georg Denoke 
Yes Thomas. I think I can't confirm the last one I think when I understand your comments in right way but when we were in October we had one part sorry â but one part was currency difference which is the big difference. Micro economic assumptions were in October already on an expected lower industrial production as we pointed out so we have reduced that against the previous years. We have seen more growth in North America therefore we have that this is more a different to other matured countries so if you mean that one then I would say to your question or what did you mean in detailed.
Thomas Gilbert
I just wondered whether there is different currency assumptions in the 2017 guidance relative to the 2015?
Georg Denoke 
Yes exactly that is what I can confirm that is the big difference. Yes.
Thomas Gilbert
Thank you.
Wolfgang Buchele
Now that's clear. So then I think I wouldn't describe these situations as you said itâs a situation when you say about where are the opportunities and are we more cautious I think it is in reduced visibility of opportunities nevertheless we are executing as I told you let's say a lot of activities at that stage for example projects as you know in the Middle East are coming on stream this year. Additional projects in other markets are coming on stream. Therefore the visibility of the ramp-ups in new plants is really not coming through on a net basis because of the end of contract as I pointed out I think this is important and then additionally now I think this is also something which we have not fully foreseen in October when we were talking about that that the electrical energy or the pass-through of natural gas itâs that significant, and that is additional eating into the net visibility against the previous year. So be â there are two effects coming together and that is actually my answer to your question.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. Thank you very much. Can I just ask CapEx by on stream by this year last figure I have seen was 800 for 2016 was 450 is that still roughly how it looks like?
Wolfgang Buchele
I think this is a fair observation with some upside for 2016. 
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question comes from Martin RÃ¶diger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin RÃ¶diger
Yes. Thanks. I have actually three questions. First thing on Australia can you update us how big Australia is for you and have you seen any price pressure in Australia when you exclude the LPG price affect and exclude the carbon text effect and the second question is on your presentation page 14 the capital statement and the so called other changes you have minus 109 million can you help me to understand what has driven this improvement compared to the performance in Q1 2014. And finally, on the so called one offs of 90 million for full year should we model in the 17 million GAAP between the Q1 figures and the full year guidance in Q2 or is there a certain kind of flips in Q2 and Q3? Thanks.
Georg Denoke 
Yes thank you for your questions. I think I am â we do not have when we hear adjust for the carbon tax and LPG effect in Australia, we do not have a negative pricing effect thatâs I think very important. We have a soft volume development, the effect is that and we have that communicated that leader activities are softer because of lower activities in manufacturing industry supporting CapEx and maintenance in the mining industry which has run on existing capacity and they proving but not enhancing capacity. I think this is important to understand then I try to understand your questions about the effects of something which you said was 100 million. Can you repeat that for me?
Martin RÃ¶diger
Yes, when you look at your presentation on page 14 there you see the cash flow statement when you see that the in the position other changes there is a delta less high pronounced burden compared to one year ago so that means that was positive for your operating cash flow this is in-line according to other changes and maybe you can help me to understand whatâs behind and especially what was the driver for that lower letâs say burden in the operating cash flow statement?
Wolfgang Buchele
Yes, overall I think the data only to be clear is coming then through cash taxes which are in these line of other changes that is one effect and then you have the other effect which is in that is certain provisions for certain activities and then you have probably some other smaller effects together, all of that together so that is mainly some provisions, some different cash taxes and then some smaller other effects but there is not one prominent effect adding up to 100 million. And then this last part of your question was about the expected savings out of the refinement and restructuring.
Martin RÃ¶diger
No, it was the so called restructuring costs or one-off costs you said 90 million and how should we model that into Q2 and Q3?
Georg Denoke 
I think the majority of these 90 million really or 70 million, 20 this quarter, 70 remaining for the rest of the year. The majority should happen in Q2. 
Martin RÃ¶diger
Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Benson, Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Benson
Yes thanks very much. I just want to go back to the quick question to explode on the targets for the medium term your 4.5 to 4.7 you haven't really based it to current rates including there is lot of uncertainty and I canât understand why you are doing that but particularly you do talk about at least significant delays by your customers in their investment decisions so everything else being equal I mean do you believe that the gross outlook in 2017 is now lower and just if you could dimensionalize that. I know there is one question but I donât really understand the â how you responded if I can ask on the merchant pricing in the key markets and how those are trending because clearly products as announced to increase prices and just want to explore what you think is happening and what slightly to happen in the coming months?
Wolfgang Buchele
Thank you for the question. I think the 2017 guidance we did not adjust only to be clear because we have seen rapid changes in currency and therefore we didn't adjust because we would have to adjust again every quarter on debt effect and therefore we didn't and we only really have 15 in mine when we talk about currency of course the assumption is that probably the dollar remains stronger for a longer period of time but then yesterday there you have seen the performance of growth in the US KPIs and we have seen aggressive assumptions again in change rate effects in dollar, euro but it has not been adjusted against what we have seen in October so that's true and we could and then you would add probably 200 million or something like that minimum in the range and then you would be there or more. So from that perspective it is something we didn't want to do --
Andrew Benson
I understand that. That's wasn't really my question was -- we still have the currency forecast as I think [indiscernible] it was really whether the underlying â is more difficult now because of theses tonnage contracts are being delayed and whether it just makes on a constant currency basis the achievement of that target more challenging?
Wolfgang Buchele
No to be clear I understood your question. I wanted to come to that I am sorry but the point my comment was really on the oil and gas especially in engineering. It was not an full fledged postponement of existing execution of projects and customers are here in the gases business in delay its really that when we look into the comparison of the previous years in engineering you have the capital of big air separation units as you know in the Asian markets for the [indiscernible]. You have a lot of petrochemical plants under opportunity and we want that in certain markets because of the low oil price or the shale gas development and that is now the push in the shift in the market that no new capacity is at that point in time under a hurry from a customer perspective for new engineering contract. I think that is important. It was not referred to the delays in gases. The delays in gases I think we covered in our capital market day where we have seen and shift in certain Asian markets and instead of three years ramp-up or one year ramp-up we have seen a shift to three to something years in certain markets. That has not changed at the current situation. The effect was really to engineering.
Andrew Benson
Okay. So if I just could be very clear you already observed within that outlook assessment the consequences have delayed but youâre still happy that even with those delays that target is on track?
Georg Denoke 
Absolutely that is the point and why don't you see it on a net basis itâs because we have end of contracts which are quite sizable I think on current stage.
Andrew Benson
Alright. Thanks.
Georg Denoke 
Then you last question on the merchant pricing I think here my point was on a low basis I think this is important when you look into merchant which means you look into cylinder, we grew roughly on a 1% basis adjusting for the LPG and the carbon tax effect and there of 60% pricing and there of 40% volume to clarify that and I think this is an important message referring to your question if you have price were visible it is.
Andrew Benson
Okay. Well thank you very much.
