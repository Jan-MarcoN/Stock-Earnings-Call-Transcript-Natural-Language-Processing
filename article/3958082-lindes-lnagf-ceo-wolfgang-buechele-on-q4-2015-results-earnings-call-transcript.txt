Dominik Heger
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results of the financial year 2015. Also, we are well into the first quarter of 2016. I kindly ask you to save any questions related to Q1 for the corresponding call on the 29th of April.
Let me walk you through today's agenda on Slide 3. Dr. Buechele will start with a summary of our business performance in 2015 followed by a discussion of our strategic focus. He will close the presentation and will -- he will close with the presentation of the outlook. Georg Denoke will then go into more depth on the operational and financial performance before concluding with a summary of our approach regarding the use of future cash flows. After this, we look forward to taking your questions.
Let me now hand you over to Dr. Buechele.
Wolfgang Buechele
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome, again, to our presentation today. The highlights of our performance in 2015 are outlined on Slide number 4. As many of you know, 2015 was a challenging year in the macroeconomic context. This was particularly true in the emerging markets. In addition, geopolitical tension, local trouble spots, and low oil prices contributed to a market reluctance to invest among other customers in the engineering division. Even under these circumstances, we increased revenue by 5.3% to â¬18 billion. This is slightly below the previous year on a currency adjusted basis. At â¬4.1 billion, operating profit exceeded the prior year's level by 5.4%.
Adjusted for currency impacts, we saw a decrease of 2.4%. Group operating margin remained stable at 23%. Operating cash flow again increased by 8.8% over last year's high level to â¬3.6 billion. We were able to achieve this increase despite of a low level of advanced payments from our engineering division. However, we are pleased to report a strong order intake in engineering in the fourth quarter. At â¬6.19, reported EPS increased 4.2% versus 2014. Note that reported EPS includes â¬192 million of nonrecurring items related to the successful implementation of our restructuring program, which we started in 2014.
I would like to move on to the development of revenue and operating profit by division on Slide number 5. Positive exchange rate effects and stable comparable growth of 2.1% supported an increase in reported revenue in the gases division of 8.5%. The engineering division revenue developed in line with progress of projects and declined by 16.5% from the record level achieved in 2014. Operating profit in the gases division reached â¬4.15 billion with operating margin holding steady at 27.4% in this challenging macroeconomic environment. Operating profit in the engineering division declined to â¬216 million resulting in an operating margin of 8.3%, which is in line with our medium-term guidance. This concludes the summary of our business performance. I would now like to move on to the discussion of our strategic focus areas on Slide number 6.
Our integrated gases and engineering model remains the cornerstone of what Linde represents. It stands at the solid core that underpins our three strategic focus areas, resilience, growth, and returns. Please allow me to take the next few minutes to address each of these themes individually, starting with our resilient gas business model on Slide number 7. Our resiliency starts with our leading position in a majority of the markets where we are active. We hold either the number one or two positions in more than 70 countries. One clear example of the strength is in our merchant business, with two-thirds of our bulk and cylinder revenues generated in countries where our market share is greater than 30%. These strong positions are important in helping us to achieve greater density, which in turn drives margins and return on assets.
I would like to continue now to Slide number 8 and give you an overview of our diverse customer portfolio. Here, you see the wide range of primary and secondary industries that make up our customer base. Our revenues are quite evenly split across the four product areas, with the resilient healthcare business representing one-quarter of total gases revenue. Please also note that a very high portion of our revenue are from contracted business, for example, in the form of take-or-pay agreements in onsite, rentals in bulk and cylinder, and contracts in healthcare. Not only are strong competitive positions and a diversified portfolio important for the resiliency of our business, but they also are the basis for further growth as well. Let me elaborate further on what I mean by this on Slide number 9, with an overview of our EMEA operating segment. Our business in EMEA is a very good representation of the points I highlighted earlier.
You can see our balanced revenue mix by product area and industry as well as our leading position in both mature markets in Europe and growth markets in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Africa. This means that we are well positioned to benefit from growth drivers in these geographies which I will now discuss briefly on Slide number 10. One clear growth driver in EMEA is the development of the chemistry and energy sector in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe, in particular in onsite. We have clear advantages to win such opportunities. Our strong competitive position and synergies that are enabled by our engineering division are important factors in this context. And additional growth driver in EMEA is the bulk and cylinder, where our combination of technological competencies together with complete product service offerings help, customers to boost their productivity and increase their differentiation. I would now like to address our competitive position in the important Asia-Pacific market on Slide number 11. Just as in EMEA, our competitive position in Asia-Pacific is solid with a strong position in each region and a strong footprint in industrial clusters.
Our track record of growing revenue and profitability in this operating segment has been very consistent over the past years. And we continue to see opportunities for further growth, which I would now like to cover on Slide number 12. In terms of industrial production development, the Asia-Pacific region is still expected to be the fastest-growing part of the world. With established power zones in China, India, Southeast Asia, and Australia, we are well positioned to capitalize on this macroeconomic development.
Additionally, customers in the region continue to progress up the value ladder, as I will show later. This will create further opportunities for us. More specifically, our leading applications technologies provide us an advantaged platform to trigger and benefit from increasing gases intensity and consumption of higher value gases. Last but not least, I would now like to touch upon our business in the Americas on Slide number 13. As demonstrated by our competitive position and revenue splits, our Americas business is both resilient and well positioned. Lincare is a factor for the medium-term resiliency of our Americas business. And it is a big part of the sizable healthcare share in the revenue mix.
Our market positions are based on established footprints in major industrial clusters on both continents as well as leadership in the United States respiratory homecare market. These factors will support further growth for our business in the Americas, as I will explain on Slide number 14. So, at a lower level than Asia Pacific, we expect industrial production to further grow in the Americas in the coming years. The need for higher quality gases for use in manufacturing and electronics, as well as more stringent environmental regulations, will provide growth opportunities for the leading applications and solutions that we can offer to our customers. In healthcare, demographic trends and increasing prevalence of chronic diseases will continue to drive demand for our healthcare services for many years to come.
I would like to continue further into the subject of growth opportunities by showing a different view of our addressable market on Slide number 15. The map on the left side shows the market for industrial and medical gases on a per capita basis. What is apparent from the Slide is that our position is not only strong in many countries where the per capita value is already high, but also very strong in many of the markets where the per capita value is still low. The chart on the right hand side shows examples of how the gap between high and low consumption countries is spread across onsite, bulk, cylinder, and healthcare. As low consumption countries climb up the value ladder, their gases consumption will grow considerably in all areas, supporting further demand for our products and services. Our leading positions in many low consumption countries as well as our unique competitive advantages give us the inside track to capitalize on such growth opportunities. I will outline these points further on the following slides, starting with our project pipeline on Slide 16. 
Our onsite business is supported by the investment activities shown here in the project pipeline. We are pleased that we could add â¬0.5 billion of projects to the pipeline with on stream dates in this and next year, as is shown in light blue in the chart. This pipeline also includes upgrades of facilities as a part of contract extensions. This part of the additions will not result in a significant revenue increase, but in an improvement in profitability for the next decade. The chart in the middle shows that our investments during the 2015 to 2017 timeframe are well balanced to capture growth across the operating segments. The chart on the right side gives a breakdown of our current project opportunities. The absolute volume has come down to around â¬3.1 billion on an 18 months forward basis.
However, this is still a solid pool of projects that are available for bidding. Let us now move on to the next driver of our sustainable growth on Slide 17. Applications are a significant component of our strategy and important growth driver for multiple reasons. First and foremost, they elevate our position and our customers from a molecule supplier to a solutions provider. Secondly, by differentiating ourselves from competitors with proprietary technologies, we drive customer loyalty. Thirdly, this is also an area where our global footprint matters. Know how accumulated in Europe in chemicals is also applicable to customers in Asia Pacific. These synergies allow us to turn our applications expertise into a broad reaching competitive advantage. Because of these factors, the share of merchant revenue, driven by tailored applications and solutions, has risen globally from around 30% to meanwhile 40%. Applications are especially gaining in importance in emerging markets.
Taking China as an example, the merchant revenue driven by applications increased from around 1% to now already 6%. As indicated earlier, to be closest to our customers, we continue to develop new solutions, optimize our existing applications, and extend the range of our product service offerings.
On the next slide, I would like to give you a brief example from the food and beverage segment. The food and beverage industry is driven by higher consumption of processed food and declining supplies of wild captured seafood. These trends lead to increasing demand for industrial gases due to improvements in the cold chain, specialized food freezing, and higher demand for seafood from agriculture. We have already established a broad range of solutions for food freezing. Our offerings include best in class proprietary technologies that have won high market acceptance. We are presently extending our offerings to include Cryoline PE. This innovative concept helps customers to rapidly cool down liquid food products, like soup or sauces. Cryoline PE delivers a capacity increase of up to 80% and efficiency improvements of around 35%.
On the next slide, I would like to discuss healthcare, another important growth driver for us. In 2015, we generated strong comparable growth in healthcare. This was to a large extent driven by Lincare. In the U.S., we further grew our market share. Increasing our patient base allows us to further demonstrate our cost leadership through economies of scale, purchasing power being an important aspect.
Market drivers for healthcare include demographics, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, such as COPD and sleep apnea, and increasing wealth in emerging markets. Our broad range of offerings for respiratory home care addresses all of these market drivers. Also, healthcare providers such as hospitals are looking for solutions to make use of digitalization to improve efficiency and patient safety. We have efforts underway to drive innovation in this area. As an example, we are currently piloting centralized cylinder management in multiple hospitals.
Our innovative cylinder LIV-IQ provides real-time patient data and, hence, allows central management of all aspects of oxygen use within the hospital. This makes it possible to both improve patient compliance and provide automatic replenishment through our digital supply chain. In other words, digitalization is helping us to get closer to our customers by being an indispensable part of the processes and performance.
Let me now continue on to our next strategic focus on Slide 12 -- 20, returns. As part of our transformation into a learning organization, we continually strive to improve the productivity of our resources. To this end, the high-performance organization programs, or HPO, have realized about â¬1.4 billion in gross cost savings since 2009.
In addition, we successfully implemented a restructuring program that targeted changes in our organizational structures as well as in the southern hemisphere. We already began to realize savings from this program in 2015 and anticipate cumulative savings of around â¬180 million up until 2017. I would like to point out that we will continue to conduct rich cost management in mature markets as well as in healthcare. The cost of these measures will, however, run through our P&L and will not be classified as nonrecurring items.
Now, let me continue on the subject of returns on Slide 21. Beyond cost savings, we also aim to improve asset returns by better leverage of our existing asset base. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, it is even more important that we focus on our competitive advantages. This includes capturing more and higher-value customers via additional applications, boosting density in our existing power zones, and optimizing the deployment of our assets between regions. Through these measures, we expect to be able to improve asset utilization as well as capital employment. Additionally, these measures will lower capital requirements for growth and, thus, further support positive cash flow development.
This leads me to the subject of our proposed dividend on Slide 22. In the annual general meeting in May, we will propose to our shareholders an increase of our dividend to â¬3.45 per share. As you know, we target to develop the dividend roughly in line with the development of the operating profit. The proposed over proportional increase of 9.5% reflects our expectation that our strong business performance will continue.
Last but not least, I would like to close with the outlook on Slides 23 and 24. In light of the persisting challenges in the macroeconomic environment, we expect Group revenue to be in the range of minus 3% to plus 4% versus the currency-adjusted figure for 2015. Since last year, we have seen a high volatility in exchange rates and therefore have chosen this framework for our outlook. Applying forward exchange rates from January 2016 to 2015 revenue results in a currency-adjusted revenue of â¬17.5 billion, about â¬0.5 billion less than reported revenue.
At the end of last November, we indicated that negative effects from both Lincare and our engineering division would already become visible starting in 2016. For Lincare, the price adjustment under competitive bidding 3 already went into effect at the start of the year. The expected negative impact from this is about â¬200 million. For the engineering division, we expect revenue of between â¬2 billion and â¬2.4 billion, a decline of approximately â¬400 million at the midpoint.
Depending on economic development, we expect revenue in the gases division to be at least at the level of the previous year and up to 5% higher than the currency-adjusted figure from the previous year. In other words, we are expecting a solid growth performance. I would like to conclude with the outlook for operating profit and ROCE on Slide 24. We expect Group operating profit to be in the range of minus 3% to plus 4% versus the currency-adjusted figure for 2015. Therein, operating profit in the gases division is expected to be in the range of minus 1% to plus 6% versus the currency-adjusted figure for 2015. The operating margin for the engineering division is expected to be around 8%, in line with our medium-term guidance. In terms on return on capital employed, we anticipate a Group ROCE of around 9%. We reconfirm our medium-term targets of Group operating profit of â¬4.2 billion to â¬4.5 billion and a return on capital employed of 9% to 10% in 2017.
This concludes my part of today's presentation. Let me now hand over to Georg, who will give you a more in-depth description of our data. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yes, thank you, Wolfgang and good afternoon to everyone. As shown on Slide 25, I would like to review the operational performance of the gases and engineering division in 2015 and then move on to our financial performance. As you know, the positive currency contribution decreased in the second half of 2015. On a full-year basis, the tailwind from currency came in at 7.7%, which you can see on page 26. The effect was moderated by headwinds from natural gas prices of 1.4%. In the reporting period, comparable growth was 2.1%. As you are already aware, comparable growth was affected by the communicated end of contracts, lower LPG prices, and the repeal of the carbon tax in Australia.
Adjusted for these additional effects, comparable growth would have been 140 basis points higher and, in total, 3.5%. Please note that this figure is not adjusted for the lower pass-through of electrical -- electricity costs. I would like to go through comparable growth and adjustments for additional facts on the next slide, which is page 27. Healthcare recorded strong comparable growth of 7.4%. Contributions came from all geographical regions and from our hospital and homecare business. Growth was driven most significantly by the strong volume growth at Lincare. Comparable growth in onsite decreased by 0.6%. Growth was adversely affected by turnarounds in the third quarter and the insolvency of a steel customer in UK.
Additionally, as you already know, the development was restrained by the end of contracts. Excluding the effect from the end of contracts, onsite would have shown comparable growth of 2.1%. Bulk revenue increased by 1.7% on a comparable basis. Growth was negatively impacted by lower LPG prices. Without these effects, comparable growth in bulk would have amounted to 3.4%.
In cylinder, comparable growth amounted to 0.4%. The development was negatively affected by lower LPG prices and the repeal of the Australian carbon tax. Excluding these two effects, cylinder would have grown by 1.6%. Let us continue by taking a look at revenue by operating segment on the next slide. Revenue in EMEA grew slightly by 0.5%. On a comparable basis, it declined by 1.2%, primarily due to the end of onsite schemes in Italy and the UK as well as a challenging macro environment in Africa. We have seen the highest growth development in the Middle East and Eastern Europe again. By product area, the highest contribution to growth continued to be from healthcare. In Asia-Pac, revenue increased by 9.1% on a reported basis. Comparable growth was 1%, with a stable growth in China.
The development in the South Pacific region continued to be impacted by lower LPG prices and the already mentioned impact of the end of contract in onsite. From a product area perspective, onsite and bulk were the strongest contributors to growth with the operating segment. In the Americas, revenue grew by 20.1% and 7.7% on a comparable basis. In particular, our North American homecare business delivered significant revenue growth. Also, in our North American industrial gases business, we realized a positive development which was supported by bulk and cylinder specialty gases.
Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in some countries in South America, we were able to show slight improvements. Proceeding now to the operating profit by operating segment, I turn to page 29. Operating profit in EMEA increased slightly by 0.7%, the negative effect of losses on receivables of â¬22 million due to the insolvency of a steel customer in UK were already booked in the third quarter. The operating margin increased slightly to 29.8%.
In Asia-Pac, operating profit increase by 5.2%, the operating profit development was supported by tailwinds from exchange rates. The margin remained solid despite a weaker South Pac region. In the Americas, operating profit increased by 24% with an operating margin of 25%. The margin development was supported by lower natural gas prices and, besides others, the improvement in our South American business as well as strong homecare performance. Let's now take a look at the engineering division performance on Slide 30. Engineering's revenue was already outlined in the beginning of the presentation. So, I don't refer to revenue. Despite the challenging environment, we were able to deliver a solid margin of 8.3%. Due to the low oil price, many customers have postponed their investment decisions, in particular in the petrochemical industry.
These effects were mainly visible in the first half of 2015. However, at â¬2.5 billion, we realized an almost average level of order intake in this challenging environment and a strong improvement in the second half. Nevertheless, compared to the very strong intake in 2014, the order intake in 2015 was 22% lower. The order backlog of â¬4.5 billion remains on a high level. However, due to the structure of major projects, there will be more moderate revenue recognition from the backlog in 2016. This is one reason for the revenue guidance for 2016. After outlining the performance of our divisions, I would like to move on to the financial performance on Slide 31. In 2015, we achieved a very high level of operating cash flow of â¬3.6 billion, which represents an increase of almost 9%. This means the cash flow showed an above-average increase compared with operating profit, which rose by 5.4%.
Net debt decreased to â¬7.6 billion and resulted in a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times. Please keep in mind that the acquisition of American HomePatient took place beginning of this year in February. Our average cost of debt remains below 4%. Our credit ratings were confirmed at A+ by Standard & Poor's and A2 by Moody's. The outlook of both ratings is stable. On page 32, you can see the CapEx development. On a Group level, the CapEx-to-sales ratio declined to 10.8% in 2015. CapEx spend in 2015 for the gases division amounted to â¬1.9 billion, resulting in a CapEx/sales ratio of 12.4%. This is below our guidance of around 2 billion and below the medium-term average of around 13%.
Based on the execution of existing projects and the expected spend for maintenance and gas distribution equipment as well as healthcare, the guidance for the gases CapEx/sales ratio for 2016 is between 11% and 12%. This further reduction of the CapEx-to-sales ratio shows our commitment to being focused with our investment activities. This leads me to the final slide to use of cash flow. Going forward, we will continue to balance returns and future growth based on our solid financial position. That means to carefully allocate cash within the famous triangle. We will definitely continue to invest in attractive projects that provide opportunities for sustainable profitable growth.
As mentioned earlier, the CapEx-to-sales ratio in our gases division was 12.4% in 2015. Secondly, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.9 times. We target to maintain a strong investment grade rating with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times maximum. Last but not least, as already mentioned, we have proposed a dividend increase of 9.5% to â¬3.45. Based on our resilient business model, we remain strongly committed to deliver total shareholder return in 2016 and beyond. 
Thank you for your attention and interest in Linde. We are happy to take your questions now. Pier, please, you may now poll for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Peter Clark, Societe Generale. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Clark
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. I'll restrict myself to two questions. The first one, the Americas margin in the fourth quarter dipped. And that was against a strong comp, but just wondering if there's anything that was going on there that was against trend. Was Lincare still in line with the margin? And then any guidance with American Home on that great looking ahead. I presume it doesn't make much money at the moment. The second question is around potential reshaping swaps. I know they're pretty small in terms of the materiality of them. But, effectively I saw something was sold in Asia Pacific, which involved equipment and size I think. So, just wondering what's going on with that sort of swap reshaping story. Thank you very much. 
Georg Denoke 
Yes, thank you, Peter, for your questions. I think I take the first one. The Americas margin was supported especially also in Q3 by a very strong cylinder performance in specialty gases, which was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter. I think that is the main reason. So, it's unrelated to the Lincare performance, which were nice and stable also in Q4. As, the strategy behind American HomePatient is really to acquire the footprint and then to focus on the synergies between these two footprints, which is a very positive driver for us. And as, we have closed the activity. And therefore, we are starting working on that already for the remaining period of the year. That's very important for us. And that is one mitigating factor from a Lincare perspective. I hand over to Wolfgang now.
Wolfgang Buechele 
Let me, Peter, quickly refer to the swap discussion. We have discussed a couple of times that it's challenging. And therefore, in particular of the two islands, Fiji and Samoa, as obviously we didn't find somebody where we could come up with an adequate swap agreement, we decided we better sell it. Because the growth potential in both markets was extremely limited, building density was also not something we considered extremely promising. And in order not to spend too much time continuing to find other opportunities to literally divest these two countries, we decided then to go for cash. It's small business.
So, from that point of view, we are not talking big money. But, it clearly underlines and shows our commitment that we want to focus on countries where we can build density. And from that point of view, we will definitely continue to look into our portfolio also in the months and quarters to come.
Peter Clark
Very clear. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Markus Mayer, Baader Helvea. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Markus Mayer 
Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions from my side. First of all, on the net debt EBITDA situation, which is now below the previously released guided range of 2 to 2.5 as the optimal level for your leverage, now with a potential also divestment like the Gist business and also like at least indication for better cash flow with this lower CapEx, am I right that the dividend now looks to be more linked to the cash flow and less to the EBITDA development? That's my first question.
And secondly, coming back to Peter's question on American HomePatient, can you give us more flavor what part of the American HomePatient acquisition is affected by the third part of competitive bidding? And am I right that, despite potential negative effects, this bolt on acquisition is highly accretive already in the full first full year? And then lastly, on this nice order intake in Q4, am I right that most of that came from the first step of your recently signed Gazprom contract? And can you give us an indication when the next three steps of this contract might come? Thanks.
Wolfgang Buechele
So, that's Wolfgang speaking. Let me start with the dynamic debt figure. If you recall, I've said in many analyst calls that I also can imagine that we are slightly below 2 for a period of time. And from that point of view, 1.9 is fully in line with these statements I made before.
Regarding Gist, not a big surprise, we don't comment on these type of rumors. But, again, I confirm we've always said, if an interesting offer for Gist comes across, we are definitely ready to look into it. And from that point of view, if attractive offer comes, we would also consider a divestment.
With this, I would hand over to Georg, give you some insights on the dividend and on order intake.
Georg Denoke
So, on the dividend, I think, of course, you have seen now an over proportionate increase of the dividend against our general growth in operating profit, which is our guidance also for the future. I think that is very important. As you know, when we talk about 2009 and we had been in a very difficult scenario with 6.7% reduction in EBITDA, we also kept dividend stable with â¬1.80. So, from this perspective, it's really only here the sign that the cash flow was extremely strong this year that we understand also from that dimension that you have to see the total picture over the years. But we do not want to change to a more general cash flow-related dividend policy. We keep the OP. As you also know, in 137 years of Linde, we never reduced dividends. So, from that perspective, it's a continuation of our stable and value-oriented dividend policy.
I think the third question was on American Home Patient. Is this right?
Markus Mayer
That's right, yes.
Georg Denoke
Yes, I think the main driver you have to understand here is for us really the footprint consolidation of American HomePatient and Lincare, which drives the synergies. And that is the main driver. Of course, this business is -- has Lincare linked to the competitive bidding business. The business mix is relatively similar, as you know. So, from that perspective, that was all included in our acquisition business plan from an overall perspective. So, there's nothing special really to mention.
Markus Mayer
And sorry, as an add on, this -- am I right? So, you have not announced anything on the purchase price. But, it looks like at least from kind of information which you can pick all together that this acquisition was really a very nice one, and this should be highly accretive already in a short period of time. Is this correct?
Georg Denoke
Yes, look, the purchase price, I think we released this. This is, of course, a plus 200 million ticket. So, this is one of the more sizable targets in the market, where we thought that really makes sense from a synergy perspective. Of course, when you look into current EBITDA multiple level, this was a very low multiple from that perspective.
Post synergies, it looks, of course, for us even better. So, from this perspective, this is one of the mitigation strategies, of course, which we also see beyond the normal organic growth in aging population and respiratory home services.
Markus Mayer
Okay. Perfect. Just lastly, on the order intake linked to Gazprom, to the Gazprom contract.
Georg Denoke
I think this -- we would be pleased to announce that, honestly. But, we have a disclosure on that one. Therefore, we are not allowed to talk about it.
Markus Mayer
But, is it right that this nice uptick of the intake in Q4 was mainly due to the Gazprom contract, or --?
Georg Denoke
Let's say it that way. The Gazprom contract was definitely a contributor to that.
Markus Mayer
Okay.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comers from John Klein, Berenberg. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
John Klein
The first one is on the margin development in Asia. We've seen two things weighing into the Asian margin over the last two years I would say, which is Australia for once, and then the second one is obviously that you had startup costs in the Asian business on the onsite business. And would you think that, with the restructuring measures included in Australia and with the significant projects being started up now, that the APAC margin should come in higher or significantly higher in 2016 than we saw it in 2015? That would be the first question.
And then the second question is on your organic growth outlook for the gases division between 0% and 5%. I'm just trying to get a feeling for how much of that is related to startups in 2016. So, what would we need to see in order to get to the higher end of that guidance? Is that merely economy driven, or how much of that is related to startups, or equivalently, the other way around, how -- what will we need to see to get to the lower end of that guidance? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So, John, thank you for this insightful question. I think, on the margin development in Asia, I think I would assume really -- but that's up to you -- that you rather keep it stable from an overall perspective because we have not seen a full decline and full rebound of the decline in the South Pacific business, which is still under watch. Let's say it that way I think. And we have not seen the economy changing at all. And that issue I think is dominating here.
On the Asian market itself, I think you would see a counterbalancing effect for that. And therefore, I would plan for a stable margin. From a perspective of the revenue guidance, I think it is, of course, partly economy related. But, as you know, we have a resilient model. And of course, when you see the IP change of the year, nevertheless our contract durations in bulk, which is three to five years, in onsite, which is 15 years plus.
So, from that perspective, that is stabilizing the trend. But, overall, it was, of course, difficult to read really China development. I think we have seen in the Chinese market and relatively stable growth in 2015 for us. As you know, we have been focusing on first-tier steel plants, which is a very important driver of that because, if you are second, third-tier steel supplier, then that is something and also, as we have heard, there is further announcement from the Chinese government related to these locations.
Therefore, we have the right strategy in place for that. We also do not have, from a coal gasification perspective, the risk that we have allocated capital to remote places. We rather were focusing on market wins for engineering to supply these customers with assets where they invest on their own. So, from that perspective, it's a mix effect. It's not only economy. But, if the economy is a little bit more harsh, then that is something which drives you to the lower end.

Thank you. The next question is comes from Thomas Gilbert, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Thomas Gilbert
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions from our end. Thank you very much for Slide 16, always very helpful with the CapEx by on-stream date. You mentioned that a part of the CapEx is basically modernization CapEx, where customers are reaching end of contract and are renewing the contract.
On the other hand, can you talk about 2016 in the context of contracts reaching end of life where the customers have opted not to extend the contracts, because we've had some hiccups in '14, '15? Is it a bit of a more -- of a smoother transition? I'm thinking especially on the legacy BOC contracts that were signed in the 1990s. That's the first question. The second question is on a comment by Dr. Buechele on I think the -- during the journalist press conference about -- that you're open for at least some small consolidation activity in the United States.
Can I ask you, does this refer to technical gases or to medical, homecare and hospital care? And as to the technical gas, do you see any room for a pickup in consolidation activity beyond the recent Airgas move that we've seen? Thank you very much.
Wolfgang Buechele
So, first of all, let me quickly go back. And I have said that before. The discontinuation, what we had in Italy was an exemption that was an unusual contract which we had. And from that point of view, that's not going to repeat itself. And from that point of view, you should not expect that. And unfortunately, the situation in Bulwer Island, the refinery of British Petroleum in Australia, was a decision by the customer for economic reasons not to discontinue the contract with us, but to shut down the whole facility.
So, that is something -- I would suggest that that's something you can never exclude that a customer, for whatever economic reasons, decides not to continue. But, we are not expecting, neither in '16, nor in '17, a repetition what we have seen from Italy. So, from that point of view, we are expecting smooth transitions. And if you recall, we have announced at the beginning of 2016 already an extension of a contract in Mexico with Pemex and we have announced an extension of the supply contract with Celanese in Singapore. So, from that point of view, we are expecting that to go smoothly.
When we are talking about consolidation, I said before, with respect to Fiji and Samoa, we decided ultimately -- a swap didn't materialize. We sold the two countries. And from that point of view, yes, we are also looking to acquire. And from that point of view, in healthcare in the United States, we anyway do that. That's nothing new. So, we will continue with this direction. But, if something adequate comes along in the gases field, we would also looking into that. But, this is not, let's say, sizable acquisitions of the size of an Airgas because, as you know, there is nothing around in this turf. And with respect to other potential acquisitions, you also know my position. So, it will be bolt-ons rather than anything else.
Thomas Gilbert
Can I just ask you your personal opinion? Is a major transaction still doable in the global space from an antitrust perspective, or are we pretty much -- is this the end game now, the setup as we have it in 
Wolfgang Buechele
I would suggest this is pretty much the end game, unless you would break someone up and sell bits and pieces. But, I wouldn't like to speculate on that.
Thomas Gilbert
Thank you, very clear. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is comes from Martin Roediger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin Roediger
Yes, thanks for taking my question. Actually, just clarification questions, you shift now your guidance, EBITDA excluding FX effects. Is it because the 100 million FX positive FX effects in 2015 would fade away if the FX rates for the little currencies will stay where they are? Another clarification question, on the target in 2017 EBITDA, 4.2 billion to 4.5 billion, unchanged, but that target is including FX effects, correct? Would you say that in case the adverse FX effects in 2016 will put a drag on 2016 earnings that the 2017 target would be now more challenging than you have assumed in November, when you have lowered your targets for 2017?
And the final question is on, again, competitive bidding 3, just to confirm price caps. You expected something between the effect we have seen in competitive bidding 1 and competitive bidding 2. And the business which is affected has a size of $400 million, excluding American HomePatient. Is that still correct?
Wolfgang Buechele
So, let me start with the EBITDA. Just to clarify, we have not changed the way we guide. We have always said that our guidance is based on an FX assumption. And the guidance we have given in November for 2017 was based on the then-applying exchange rates, meaning the November exchange rates. As obviously in the first two months there was already a substantial change, we have decided to be more accurate this time to avoid misunderstandings. And that's why we have guided the way we've guided with a corridor. But, all our guidance at any time was subject to adjustments to exchange rates.
Regarding CB3, as we said, the overall impact is approximately â¬200 million. I said that also in my presentation. And the related sales is approximately 600 million, not 400 million. 400 million was the original assumption at the time where Lincare was still private public, sorry. And meanwhile, due to growth of business, etc., we are talking roughly â¬600 million with â¬200 million impact.

Thank you. The next question comes from the Thomas Wrigglesworth, Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Thomas Wrigglesworth
Thank you very much. I'm interested on your Slide 8, again, where you talk about -- sorry, slide -- I've got the wrong slide -- Slide 16. Let's get the first question right. You talk about decaptivation opportunities. This has circled around for a little while now. Are we on the cusp of material decaptivation opportunities? And relative to the market opportunities you have at 3.1 billion, what's the kind of order of magnitude that decaptivation may offer when it occurs? That's my first question. And the second question is relating to Slide 8. You talk about 30% market share as this kind of split for the merchant market. Do you see that at some point where you gain pricing power? Could you tell me why 30% is an important market share? Thank you.
Wolfgang Buechele
Let's start with the decaptivation. First of all, as it's stipulated on Slide 16, decaptivation is not included in the 3.1 billion, which factually means it would be an additional upside. Why have we not included it? As you already indicated, decaptivation is a little bit more tricky because first of all, the question is, is the customer who wants to decaptivate, is this a sound customer? And is the customer able to survive in the long run, or is it a customer who is in distress, and in order to get sudden cash flow, he's now considering divest? And that's why we are looking very selectively case by case. And that's why we have not included it. And I would not speculate at this point whether something materializes or not in the course of the year. But, if something materializes, it would clearly be an upside.
Secondly, with the market share, look, whether it's 29% or whether it's 32%, that's give or take the same for me. We are talking about density in a market. And when we have a certain density, and typically when it's around 30% or higher than we have the density, then we have a certain pricing power. And we have shared at our Capital Markets Day the approach we have in markets with power zones. And to be very clear, we are talking local market shares. We are not talking holistic market shares across a country because our business is in a circle of around 250 kilometers or miles, whatever you want, around a facility. And there, the market share needs to be in that range.
Thomas Wrigglesworth
Okay. Thank you very much for that.

Thank you. The next question comes from [Indiscernible] Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst 
Hello, good afternoon. Two on my side. The first one is on your product mix in Q4. It looks like you have an acceleration of the business in cylinder. Can you comment on regions and how you feel about 2016 in cylinders, especially in Europe, please? And the second one is in CapEx. So, you show a first reduction of the CapEx sales at least in gases. I wanted to discuss more, what's your flexibility there, and a range of CapEx to sales that you would from top and bottom that you would be willing to give us for the years to come. Thank you very much.
Wolfgang Buechele
I think on the development, the PGP business, as I pointed out in my presentation, it's really about the specialty gases effect, especially in the Q4. Also, Q3 already we have seen that. But, Q4 it was coming through more visibly, even if this was not a stronger effect. But, South Pacific was a little bit more stable in that respect. So, from this perspective, it is PGP it is mainly North America and Europe.
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay. And do you see a pickup in cylinder in Europe, or you sold out, or how's your view there?
Wolfgang Buechele
I think we haven't seen a significant change, with the exception on the specialty gases development.
Unidentified Analyst 
Okay.
Georg Denoke
Just let me quickly comment on the CapEx. First of all, we have reduced our CapEx forecast for 2016. And I would like to clarify one aspect. We have not done that on the account of gross CapEx. But, we have taken CapEx out of GDE minor because we want to pursue all the growth opportunities. We have a pipeline of 3.1 billion, which you can see on Slide 16. And from that point of view, whether the CapEx goes further down or whether the CapEx stays at that level very much depends on two factors. What is the decision rate on the 3.1 billion? And what is our win rate ultimately? And secondly, is there an opportunity for decaptivation or not? That will have an impact on the figures, how they develop going forward. And from that point of view, I don't want to speculate for 2017 and thereafter at this point.
Unidentified Analyst 
Could you give us a floor at least where you couldn't go below in terms of CapEx to sales, or you can't even do that?
Georg Denoke
Look, Jeff I think only to be clear also the year 2016 is significantly impacted by carryovers of major projects we are undertaking from previous investment decisions. I think that is the point. So, when you see this, this is probably a number which is above 500 million, right, more probably 600. So, from that perspective, if we continuously see then investment decision, as Wolfgang described, you will have a different elevator level. If you wouldn't have that, which we don't assume I would also say, then it would go further down because carryovers will become smaller from investment decisions.

Thank you. The next question comes from Andreas Heine, MainFirst. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andreas Heine
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. The first is on Lincare. Would you be able to update what you think your market share is, including American HomePatient, after the strong growth in 2015? And secondly, on engineering, you had quite a good order intake in the last quarter. And I think, also, your engineering division will be busy with your extension of orders at Celanese and the other big order you have for Pemex. In former times, you have said, if the incoming orders of engineering won't be good in the first half of this year, then you might consider a restructuring program to be executed in the second half. Is that off the table? And then one question on the gas price, which is substantially down also going into 2016. In your whole organization, is that always pass through, or can you also profit on the lower gas price in the business? So, is something of that sticking, or is all of that to be transferred to customers? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Let me start with market share in healthcare. Obviously, the market share went further up naturally. But, you hopefully understand that we are not guiding on a detailed figure because this is a very sensitive discussion. Secondly, when you talk about the order intake, yes, we have said that, originally if the order intake would not improve, we would have an issue with a potential restructuring in engineering, as obviously you could see that we got projects from Gazprom. The order intake went up in the fourth quarter. Secondly, we see more feed studies coming in where customers are asking us for engineering studies for future projects. At this point in time, we don't see a need for restructuring in the second half. And with the gas price, very simple, we always have, unfortunately, to pass it through. So, from that point of view, it goes up as well as down. That's the good news, but we don't have windfall from that.
Andreas Heine
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Mackey, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Mackey
Couple of quick questions just to finish up, I wonder, the -- you've quantified the pricing effect from CB3 for 2016. I just want to be clear. That's basically three quarters of the pricing effect, if I understand correctly. So, it's 50% from the start of the year and then 100% from the middle of the year. So, am I right in understanding there's another 65 million or so for 2017 versus 2016? That's question one.
The second question, I just wanted to come back on cylinders. And apologies, I don't know if I've missed something or if I'm coming at it from a slightly different perspective from Jeff's question. But, I was surprised that cylinders weren't a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter, given the sort of annualization of the carbon tax effects and LPG and so on. And if I strip out the Wesfarmers acquisition, it would suggest that cylinders were actually comparably down a little bit in the fourth quarter again. So, you talked about U.S. specialty gases. Could you just -- I just wanted to run through some of those dynamics again, if you could, please, in the quarter in cylinders. Thank you.
Wolfgang Buechele
Okay. Let's start with this one, Peter. I think it is -- as I said, it is specialty gases. It's always a little bit related not only to volume, as you know. It's also then related in specialty gases in many of the cases to pricing. So, pricing was -- in the second half, we have to say that a little bit stronger in certain dimensions from specialty gases applications in this respect. Therefore, it's not the quantity here. It's more the price which was helping us.
Peter Mackey
Right. But, as I say, you have annualized a lot of the negative effects. So, I'm surprised that you didn't see a bit more acceleration in the fourth quarter in cylinders overall.
Wolfgang Buechele
As I tried to point out, I think we saw specific effect on the volume side, [holdings], which is still in soft economy, is still there. It's a sizable business also. So, here, that is the mitigating factor.
Peter Mackey
Right. Understood. Thank you.
Wolfgang Buechele
And with respect to CB3, you're absolutely right. There is also a residual impact in the size or in the range you just indicated in 2017.
Peter Mackey
Thank you very much.
