Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Jason Thompson. Please go ahead.
Jason Thompson
Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. John Luke, Bob Beckler and Mark Rajkowski are here to review our third quarter results. We also have Bob Feeser here for Q&A as well.
The notification for this call was broadly disclosed and it is being webcast at mwv.com, where slides are also available. Our results and commentary are presented on a continuing operations basis and are correct as of today, but could include time-sensitive information that is subject to change. In addition, any statements that are forward-looking are subject to known and unknown risks and are not guarantees of future performance.
Iâll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Luke.
John A. Luke
Jason, thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. We continue to make strong progress, executing on our strategies for profitable growth and margin improvement during the third quarter. Our result demonstrate that weâre on track toward our goal of achieving industry-leading margins, which we define is our EBITDA margin on a fully allocated basis excluding pension income by the end of 2015.
In the third quarter, we increased revenue and EBITDA. We (technical difficulty) our cost structure, doing so against the backdrop of an increasingly challenging global economic environment. Overall, we nearly doubled earnings per share during the quarter, continuing a trend of steady improvement throughout the year that demonstrates the value and the impact of our strategy.
Despite slowing or stagnant economic growth, we have continued to differentiate our business through market knowledge, targeted participation and innovative high-quality solutions that help our customers win in todayâs very competitive global marketplace. As a result, we are outperforming broader trend in most of the markets we serve. And we have punctuated this commercial performance with margin levels in each business that places in the range of our top peers and competitors, including notable progress in each of our packaging segments.
We also continue to generate record level performance in our Specialty Chemicals segment with gains in each of our key markets. Overall, weâve made solid progress on both the top and bottom line this year and weâre confident that our determined, commercial and operational focus will extend our current momentum and result in long-term sustainable success.
Iâll now turn the call over to Bob Beckler for additional commentary about our performance and our outlook. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Thank you, John. Throughout the year, in the third quarter, we continued to strengthen our performance with balanced commercial and operational execution in each of our business segments, along with continued improvement in efficiency and cost structure.
As John underscored, we are focused on delivering leadership margins in each segment and we are well on track to achieve those goals. Iâll briefly summarize the performance in each of the segment and provide some color behind the numbers.
Beginning with the Food & Beverage segment. Third quarter sales increased 7% versus prior year, while EBITDA increased nearly 16% resulting in a margin improvement of 140 basis points for the quarter. This improvement was driven by continued share gains in many of our targeted markets, improved operating productivity and benefit from our capital investments over the past year.
Packaging paperboard demand remained strong throughout the quarter, especially for food and tobacco application as we continue to win with our differentiated paperboard solution that provide our global customers with productivity and quality advantages.
Food revenue increased 4%, as strong food service shipment more than offset weakness in packaged food and some deceleration weâve seen in liquid packaging markets. Tobacco volume was also strong, as we gained share globally with our quality paperboard that runs with high efficiency on our customers packing lines.
In beverage, we grew revenue 3% driven by gains in North America, Asia and Latin America. No question, beverage markets are very dynamic around the world, but overall we continue to grow this business by targeting key brand owners who require the full suite of innovative packaging solutions, high performance machinery and flexibility to respond in a rapidly changing marketplace. As a result, we are gaining positions across the full sector ranging from the big brands to the medium and small accounts including the fast growing craft brew sector.
On the operations side of Food & Beverage, we increased productivity with strong performance at our mills even with $15 million of higher wood cost compared to last year. In the Covington mill, the new biomass boiler has been a tremendous positive, making that large-scale SBS facility now 100% self-sufficient for electricity.
As we look to the fourth quarter, which comes with the typical year-end seasonality, there are several specific challenges we will be managing. Continued weakness in packaged food and liquid packaging, ongoing wood cost inflation and negative impact from foreign currency exchange. Having said that, we still expect fourth quarter earnings in Food & Beverage to improve modestly versus prior year, driven by solid operational execution and commercial momentum across our diverse global markets.
Turning to Home, Health & Beauty, quarterly earnings doubled compared to last year resulting in a 180 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. Year-to-date, EBITDA margin for the segment is above 15%, which represents a 320 basis point improvement compared to 2013 and demonstrates the significant commercial and operational progress we have made.
Revenue in the third quarter was up 4%, excluding sales from the folding carton businesses in Brazil and Europe that we exited the past year. Dispensing sales were up 6% driven by strong growth in fragrance, trigger sprayers for home cleaning and aerosol actuators for air care.
In the quarter, we also increased sales in healthcare adherence applications. In this business, we have now completed the transition to our Shellpak Renew paperboard product line, extended our contract with a major retail customer and launched adherence solutions with several high profile branded pharmaceuticals.
Our innovation pipeline in Home, Health & Beauty is strong, with multiple new product launches having an impact across the business this year. And we continue to make investment this quarter, completing the move to a larger facility in Milan to support new projects and additional growth over time.
In the fourth quarter we expect segment earnings to be higher than last year, about the same order of magnitude as in the third quarter. The overall business slowed slightly towards the end of the year, as we build inventory for next yearâs lawn and garden season and accommodate customer slowdowns around the holidays. Also, we will have higher resin prices, which, due to timing, wonât get pass through until the end of the quarter.
In industrial packaging, sales grew 14% and earnings were up 63% resulting in 580 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement versus prior year. In Brazil, economic conditions remain weak and continue to pressure industrial production and consumption in the region. Despite the lingering challenges there, we achieved 2% volume growth in corrugated packaging and 36% year-on-year growth in kraftliner sales.
In third quarter we set a new production record at our Tres Barras mill. And this combination of strong, operational and commercial execution resulted in a 30% EBITDA margin in the quarter, the high end of our targeted range for the year.
In India, we increased sales by almost 30% during the quarter. Fourth quarter will mark two years since our initial acquisition of mill operations in India and we are continuing to make progress with our long-term strategy of building high-quality containerboard positions with the growing corrugated market in that region. This includes the ongoing ramp up of a new machine at one of our two mills in Gujarat state.
Overall outlook for industrial packaging is for slightly better fourth quarter results than last year. In Brazil, we expect quarterly EBITDA margin will come in somewhat below the third quarter level, given the seasonality and the timing of our annual mill outage, but full year EBITDA should still be well in the targeted range for the year.
Our Specialty Chemicals business continues to perform strongly. Third quarter sales grew 9% and earnings grew 5% with an EBITDA margin of 27%. This business continues to grow and gain share globally in its targeted specialty markets: oilfield chemicals, asphalt innovations and activated carbon with unique products supported by the deep applications expertise we bring to our customers in each market. In the fourth quarter, we expect segment profit for Specialty Chemicals to be modestly higher than last year.
And finally, in our Community Development and Land Management business, activity is picking up across the major developments we have in the growing Charleston, South Carolina region. The two largest projects, Nexton and East Edisto, are well positioned to take advantage of a growing economy and new residential demand in the region. At Nexton, the initial retail and office development is nearly complete and we expect to sell lots to homebuilders by the end of the year, and as these data show, the timeline is right on track with a planned launch of the community in the spring of 2015.
To summarize, the margin improvement weâve been steadily making is really a testament to good execution on the fundamentals for strategy. Focused participation in the global market, strong operational execution and cost discipline. We still have more work to do and now without challenges in global market. But we are confident in continuing our positive momentum to achieve the targeted leadership global margin, we envision across each segment.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark to discuss our financial results.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Thanks, Bob. We had a strong quarter across all of our key financial measures with standout performance in a few areas that Iâll highlight as they clearly demonstrate our strategy is working and our execution is on track. First, our 7% sales growth in the quarter reflects the benefit of our improved commercial capabilities centered on selling our higher value product offerings.
Weâre very pleased with our continued ability to increase volume, largely to share gain, which accounted for over five points of our top line growth. In our differentiated higher value packaging and specialty chemicals solutions generated more profitable revenue as reflected in our overall price mix improvement in the quarter. We also generated excellent operating leverage in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $285 million, or nearly 20% of sales.
Each of our packaging business is delivered double-digit EBITDA growth. Our margin expansion in the quarter was driven by better productivity in our facilities and excellent benefits from the capital investment weâve made in our mills, as well as lower SG&A resulting from our cost reduction activities.
Adjusted gross margin improved 210 basis points to approximately 23% sales, and adjusted SG&A improved by 160 basis points to 9.5% of sales and declined over 8% on an absolute basis. We achieved another $26 million of savings associated with our margin improvement program in the quarter, bringing our total for the year-to-date of $56 million. With the remaining actions, weâve identified, we expect to exceed our $75 million target for 2014, and achieve our $125 million savings target by 2015.
Finally, free cash flow on the quarter improved by approximately $70 million year-over-year, due to higher earnings and lower capital spending. We defined free cash flow as cash after CapEx and dividends. CapEx through the first nine months was $214 million, which is down from $337 million in the same period last year.
The difference reflects lower project capital related to the Covington biomass boiler, which was commissioned in the fourth quarter of last year. Total CapEx for the year will be approximately $350 million. During the quarter, we also used $40 million of cash to repurchase shares in connection with our previously announced program, which we completed earlier this month.
Just a quick update on the work weâre undertaking to bring our corporate cost allocation methodology in line with peers. We expect to complete this work in the first quarter next year, and begin reporting segment result under the new allocation methodology at that time.
Now turning to the outlook. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued significant earnings momentum year-over-year. As Bob noted, we expect year-over-year profit increases in each segment, as we continue to execute well commercially, and operationally, and effectively manage the controllables. However, the rate of our year-over-year improvement will moderate, compared to the first nine months of the year, due to the negative impacts, weâre now seeing from weaker foreign currency, as well as some weakening demand conditions in Europe, and certain food packaging category.
With that, Iâll now turn the call back over to John.
John A. Luke
Mark, thanks very much. We are and will remain under landing in our pursuit of profitable growth and best-in-class margins in each of our businesses, and weâre confident that weâll be successful. And that our strategy will enable us to continue to grow profitably and deliver value to our shareholders.
Weâll now be happy to turn the floor over to you and answer any questions that you might have of us this morning.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Mark A. Weintraub â The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Good morning. just one quick question on the cost improvement or cost reduction, I believe in the first quarter, you said youâve got $9 million; in the second quarter, youâve got $21 million. Do you have a number for the third quarter?
Robert K. Beckler
$26 million, Mark.
Mark A. Weintraub â The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
$26 million, okay, great. And then in terms of NetSpend and/or East Edisto, can you frame for us at all centers to what type of contribution is realistic, as we kind of look ahead for the next year, as some of these projects begin to ramp into commercial mode?
Robert K. Beckler
Hey, Mark. I think that contribution through most of next year will be really marginal. theyâre still finishing the development phase in NetSpend as well as East Edisto, which a community that weâve got underway there that will ramp up in the first part of 2015, but we certainly expect by 2016 that our partnerships there will be substantially cash flow positive with those cash flow streams growing in the years beyond that.
Mark A. Weintraub â The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated
Okay. Thank you.
Robert K. Beckler
Thanks Mark.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
Mark W. Connelly â CLSA Americas LLC
John and Bob, you alluded to the changes in the beverage market. The big beverage customers on the soft drinks side are not seeing much growth in core products and there is fairly good reason to think thatâs probably going to continue for a while. Can you talk about how thatâs going to affect the balance in your CUK business and how much of your business currently is soft drink, beer and food particularly in the U.S. and how much the overseas trends can help offset that?
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yeah. Mark, let me offer a couple of question or a couple of comments of the asset, then Iâll turn to Bob. I think youâve heard on with your last point one of the key areas of opportunity, clearly there are domestic challenges in both the beer and the soft drink business. But I think weâre seeing good creativity coming out of both as the promotions take place and in the beer side certainly as there is a very positive response to us going on in the craft sector.
more broadly what weâre saying is, there is continued growth in both areas on a global basis and given the positioning we have, and the investments that weâre prepare to make to get support continuing growth around the world. We see good opportunity to continue to enjoy the benefits that come from growing the global beverage markets. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
And just building on Johnâs comment, weâre managing a very flexible model around the CNK platform, I think very effectively. While the headlines are around carbonated soft drinks. Weâre actually doing quite well, holding our ground in CSD, if you consider there our multipack formats really serve the can market in that sector.
In terms of your question around balance, weâre roughly one-third soft drinks, two-thirds beer. And that model continues to flux and particularly flux globally, as we see tremendous opportunity for growth in the global and particularly developing markets. Weâre having some success with format shifts. to some extent, weâre corrugated, but largely, we see opportunity in converting from plastic shrink, where weâve had examples, specific examples of that in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and even recently a case in North America.
so still there is a lot of opportunity there despite the overwriting dynamics. And the other thing that we like just to finish off is the fact that itâs a dynamic market that requires agility and responsiveness. And we feel like weâre very well positioned globally to be able to operate in that dynamic and provide brand owners with the total support that they need, not just the pack, but innovations and design expertise and very flexible machinery options to suit their needs.
Mark W. Connelly â CLSA Americas LLC

Thatâs helpful. And just changing gears for a second. If we look at your Specialty Chemicals business, it just keeps running and running and you found a lots of new places to go. If we do see a slow down in exploration and fracking, is that going to finally slow down the performance of that business?
John A. Luke
Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
I mean, itâs a great question. We have not seen that at this stage Mark. The business is pretty diverse in terms of the end market applications that it serves, fracking is just one component of many in the oilfield sector that weâre going after and making gains. Weâre actually continuing to take share in the market. And I would say at this stage, weâve not seen overall demand, tail-off given the cooling off of oil prices. Our perspective would be that you have to get down below $70 per barrel to really see any significant amount of drilling and production come off of the table.
And even then if that were to happen which I think is probably a bit of the long shot â weâve got a very flexible operating model, which goes back to the way that we refine our products and flex our products across multiple specialty end markets. So weâre very mindful of the dynamic that youâre rightly pointing to, Mark, but we feel very good about our ability to grow in that sector for a long-time.
Mark W. Connelly â CLSA Americas LLC
Thank you very much.
Robert K. Beckler
Thanks Mark.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Hi Rob and good morning. Thanks for the details. Nice job on the slide deck by the way. Again, I guess, my first question I wanted to piggyback on Markâs question. So to the extent that weâre seeing over time increased share growth of the can and the packing mix for the beer in particular. Does that help you given your overall exposure to beer relative to soft drink or does glass pack and paperboard just as much as cans in non-North American markets.

Robert K. Beckler
Well, weâre seeing opportunity in both, but I would say that can volume is the lead driver of the opportunity that weâre seeing particularly in the developing markets if you think about the conversion from shrink. But weâve seen opportunity in bottles as well. Latin America being a good example where our customers are really working hard to improve the retail shop appearance of their products, both can and bottle, and multipack is a excellent solution to premiumize the brands.
George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Bob, just a quick on that. I mean as you premiumize, do you still see more use of paperboard with a returnable glass bottle or would you tend to see the paperboard pack work more and more with a one way glass package?
Robert K. Beckler
Thatâs a great question. Weâre seeing a little bit of both and in fact weâre actually doing returnable glass bottle in high-end corrugated packaging down in Latin America. Weâve seen a pretty good uptick in that application over the past year, but I think ultimately the trend is more heavily directed towards one way.

George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thanks for that. I will ask two quick ones and turn it over. You had very nice progress in corporate spending thatâs obviously been something that the investment committee has been focused on for you for a number of years. Do you think that you could continue this type of year-on-year progress into the fourth quarter and the first half of 2015 as we saw in the third quarter? And then back to Home, Health & Beauty, given recent health concerns around the world, have you seen any kind of uptick in your dispensing for hand sanitization products and that sort of thing. Thanks guys.
John A. Luke

Yes, George, this is John. Let me just comment on the later part of the question and I will ask Bob or Mark to elaborate and then Mark can pick up your corporate class. I think the early signs would suggest that we are seeing a little bit of an uptick, but thatâs building on a base that was established as a much stronger base for that business a few years ago, the H1N1. Clearly, there were early signs of activity, how large it will get remains to be same. Bob, anyâ¦?
Robert K. Beckler
Yes, I just would add to that. It was a pretty big deal for us with the H1N1 issue that that came out a few years ago. Itâs pretty early right now to say that there is going to be much of a shift, but weâre definitely monitoring it. And weâre very close with our customers on it particularly around hand cleaning and sanitizing application.
E. Mark Rajkowski
Yes, George. Weâve made good progress through the first nine months. We expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2015 and that continues to be an area of focus for us and we made a lot of progress but weâll more to do.
George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch

I mean sequentially should we see any kind of retracement or you feel pretty good about the gap youâve opened up so far for the next couple of quarters?

Robert K. Beckler
Yes, no, I think you should expect those levels to be fairly consistent with what we just posted in Q3. I mean there is always...

George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Understood.
Robert K. Beckler
The odd accrual here or there, but that the fundamental structure â those changes are permanent.

George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you very much.
Robert K. Beckler
Youâre welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Adam J. Josephson â KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Thanks. Good morning everyone.
John A. Luke
Hi, Adam.
Robert K. Beckler
Good morning, Adam.
Adam J. Josephson â KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
John, just the obligatory MLP question for you and my apologies for asking, but can you provide us with any updated thoughts regarding putting some of your assets into such a structure?
John A. Luke
Adam, no apologies necessary. Let me make a couple of comments and I will ask Mark to follow-on. I think itâs fair to say that weâre opened to any structure that would enhance shareholder value and thatâs certainly includes the MLP concept. It certainly one that has proven interesting and capture the attention of a good deal of the industry and certainly the investment community. And weâre learning a lot from our own continuing assessment and from others who were speaking out publicly on it as well.
All of that said, and as our investors would expect, we are attaching a priority focus right now to evaluating the value maximization alternatives for our chemical business as weâve talked back since September. And thatâs been our principle focus, but MLP certainly would be on the table. Mark?
E. Mark Rajkowski
We spent more time learning about understanding the structure and while complex it is certainly very interesting and no question that we will be further assessing those benefits, the implications. But as you point out, our priority has been really â and weâre very focused on assessing the strategic alternatives to maximizing the value of our specialty chemicals business. So that has been and will continue to remain our priority.
Adam J. Josephson â KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Thanks Mark and John. John, just one on chemicals. Can you provide us with any updated thoughts you have on maximizing the value of that business, I know you talked about that at a conference about a month and half ago, but any update would be appreciated?
John A. Luke
I think the update I would offer would be that we stated our intent back in September remain true to that commitment.
Adam J. Josephson â KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Okay. And Mark, forgive me if I missed this, but any change to your previously stated EBITDA guidance for this year of $1 billion to $1.25 billion?
E. Mark Rajkowski
I think as you heard on the call today, weâve got a lot of momentum. Weâre managing the controllables extremely well. Weâre going to continue to do that. I think itâs important to have â put all that context as youâve, Iâm sure, read and heard and certainly, itâs no difference for us the global economic environment has gotten more volatile, more uncertain. We are seeing some weakening of demand in Europe as well as in certain of our food packaging categories.
And I think the other thing to keep in mind is that since our last call, weâve seen a substantial decline over 10% in the last several months in the value currencies in Europe and Brazil. But that said, we are continuing to manage very aggressively. Weâre looking to pull all the levers and weâre intensely focused on delivering that $1 billion of EBITDA.
Adam J. Josephson â KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.
Thanks a lot Mark. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
Mark Wilde â Bank of Montreal
Good morning.
John A. Luke
Hi, Mark.
Mark Wilde â Bank of Montreal
I wanted to talk first about the industrial packaging business. Anything that would keep you from kind of maintaining that 30% number down in Brazil going forward?
John A. Luke
I think weâre very comfortable with the progress weâre marking Mark. You know that business, as well as anyone on the call and I think weâre very enthusiastic, clearly itâs a bit more of a challenging environment, but I will ask Bob Beckler to comment on lot of the leverage that weâre pulling down there to ensure that we continue to drive forward progress. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Mark, we not so subtly highlighted the fact that we hit the 30% EBITDA target in the third quarter, down in Brazil, which had been on the high end of our 25% to 30% range for the year. As I indicated in the outlook and probably wonât be quite that in the fourth quarter. But the point there is that itâs really encouraging with progress that weâre making with the mill hitting its production target now with still opportunity to further optimize the mix and the cost of production with the expanded platform that we have there.
And I would add with the corrugated market, itâs performing very weakly, I would say in the given economy without much prospect at least this far. We can see under the future for much improvement. So our strategy is working and itâs working well in a pretty difficult environment and itâs just this combination of the power of the investment that we made down in Brazil. And the commercial strategy that we have thatâs very, very focused on the corrugated side, not to mention the great success that weâre seeing in leveraging our new supply of kraftliner in the market.
Mark Wilde â Bank of Montreal
Okay. And I just wanted to turn over to food and beverage and I think if you can give us a little more color on where youâre picking up share and then also if we continue to see kind of paper board do well in food service. Is there any potential for you to re-start any of the idle capacity that you have. And I know you have at least one machine at Evadale, itâs â that is idle and I canât recall whether you have idle capacity at Covington?
Robert K. Beckler
Great question, Mark. Bob Feeser, you want to comment on that?
Robert A. Feeser
Yeah. Hey, Mark. We are continuing to see as you mentioned good share gain in the food service market, certainly the shift from foam to paper board have been a positive and weâre working closely with our major customers to drive that change. Weâre also seeing very good success broadly in SBS, across a number of food applications, frozen food in particular, where we continue to develop good business in that area.
In regards to capacity you rightly point out that we do have a machine in Evadale that we had shut down from paper board capacity several years ago. We would not be planning on re-starting that machine to manufacture paper board in the near future.
Mark Wilde â Bank of Montreal
Okay, that is great. And then just one final one, John, can we discuss the thoughts on kind of succession planning on where weâre at there?
Robert A. Feeser
Well, Mark youâve asked that periodically. I think we have a board that is actively focused on succession planning and a good process is in place.
Mark Wilde â Bank of Montreal
Okay, good enough. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Chip A. Dillon â Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Yes, and good morning everyone. First question just a small one, but, I think you have mentioned the increase in profitability you would expect to see in home, health and beauty would be similar in the fourth quarter than as it was in the third, is that in a percentage term or in absolute dollars?
John A. Luke
Itâs â Chip, itâs absolute dollars.
Chip A. Dillon â Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay, that is helpful. Secondly, I know itâs â youâre probably into the process of the recasting of the Corporate expense. I know you still have quite a bit of work left ahead of you, but intuitively one would think that probably a lower proportion from looking at sales would go to chemicals, because I know you manage that business and itâs more or less stand alone down in Charleston, where my guess is the other segments outside of Rigesa, of course, are managed closer to home in Richmond and is that fair to say that a greater proportion versus sales of that recasting will be borne by those operations in Richmond?
John A. Luke
Chip, weâre still working through that. I mean your observations certainly are logical, but we donât want to get ahead of the curve here, we are still going through that work and, our focus is really going to be looking at the level of activity and support that we are providing to each of the segments and that is what is going to drive the answer.
Chip A. Dillon â Vertical Research Partners, LLC

Okay. And I noticed this year that working capital, if you leave out cash and debt in the current accounts is a bit higher than last year. And I didnât know if that is sort of a new run rate that needed to support, maybe more products especially in home health and beauty or do you think that it may come down a bit low, whatâs weâve seen in the past?
John A. Luke
Yes, Chip there is some of that is certainly influenced by the growth, both in terms of receivables and inventories, a little bit of that is timing on some of the sales, but weâre always looking at driving as much efficiency in our supply chain, including working capital as possible. And weâre not looking at any subsident change in terms of what we would expect in terms of cash to cash cycle on a long-term basis.

Chip A. Dillon â Vertical Research Partners, LLC

And then just one last quick one, tax rate came down nicely. Iâm sure that was geographic mix. Could you give us some view as to how we should think about the fourth quarter maybe next year? And also would CapEx likely change what is going in the next year?
John A. Luke
Chip youâre absolutely right that the change what you saw in the effective tax rate in the quarter was really effective, the cumulative catch up as we do our GAAP accounting to recognize that the rate that we had in there through the first three quarters, which was 31%. We now expect the full year to be at 30% so all of that gets reflected in the third quarter provision. So, we do expect full-year and therefore fourth quarter tax rate to be 30%.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman from UBS. Please go ahead.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Hi, good morning.
John A. Luke
Good morning Gail.
Robert A. Feeser
Good morning.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
I guess maybe just quickly on CapEx on Chipâs comment. $350 million is a pretty big step up from where youâre through three quarters, are there any particularly unique project that was going out that are happening in the fourth quarter?
John A. Luke
No â this is not an unusual phenomenon in terms of the spending. We typically see a little bit of a bump in the fourth quarter Bob.
Robert A. Feeser
Hi, Gail itâs Bob Feeser. In general, we would see probably 34% to 35% of our total capital spend take place in the fourth quarter. So as we looked at where we are tracking after three quarters. This is pretty typical, so we would expect to really land it close to $350 million overall for the quarter.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Okay and just kind of looking at the environment and maybe a couple of products in particular. 19% volume growth in tobacco is that sustainable what geography, is it coming from? Is it catch up from prior quarters, can you just give a little bit of color there?
Robert A. Feeser
Yeah, Gail, this is Bob Feeser again. Just a little bit of color on that. Weâre really making some solid gains in China with our paper board, primarily in the high end brands, where theyâre still switching from soft pack to hard pack. And our product really has a very strong value proposition in the high speed packing lines that see being installed in China.
So we believe that there is still good upside in growth in China, based on the dynamics that we see. So the majority of what we experienced in the third quarter was that growth in China.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Okay. And CNK volumes were down a little bit year-on-year it seems like that backlogs are down fairly significantly year-on-year. Is there anything going on there?
Robert A. Feeser
And Gail itâs â I mean itâs not a substantial trend for us, because beverage is remaining very, very strong and helping offset some of the weakness that we have been reporting over the last couple of quarters on the food packaging side.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Okay and just broadly on the demand environment, you talked about increasingly challenged environment and some pressure on food, some others have talked about â may defines that some of the food company, Iâm just trying to get a little bit more promotional. Do you have any sense of that? And just in general, it sounds like Europe is perhaps where the biggest changes but can you just confirm that and just talk about what has changed on the demand environment quarter-over-quarter?
John A. Luke
Gail, let me offer a couple of comments and then Iâll turn it Bob to embellish on. I think overall we are seeing food companies responding, there is more promotional activity, and we are operating as weâve commented several times and what is a rapidly changing and challenged global economy environment. That said weâve operated around the world for a long period of time.
We understand how the maneuver these trends. And we have focused very heavily over time on the end markets in which we participate and then looking to participate with a very measured and focused strategies. And thatâs really was driving our activity and frankly has led to advantage for us and what otherwise has been a challenging European market that you referred to. Bob?
Robert K. Beckler
Youâre right Gail that the food companies are under some pressure globally. I think itâs been widely reported that there is declining consumer spending as a percent of discretionary spend on food and to some extent beverage items that theyâre contending with.
So I think it would not be a surprise to see promotional activity pickup in that environment. Although, it hasnât really been a tremendous driver of our business at this stage where weâve been effective I think and operating in this environment is and really targeting our participation very carefully in the markets with brand owners pulling through our higher quality substrates for applications were it really make sense to drive the quality, premiumisation and to some extent higher productive as Bob reflected around tobacco.
We see the same thing on the food side. I just also comment in closing off that one of the trends that we believe that is a play certainly in North America and Europe and maybe globally just to shift from Iâd just say processed foods to more fresh and perceived healthy alternatives and this is creating some shift in the retail environment that is still playing out we believe and while creating some dynamics there that that may make a challenging for packaging companies that also creates opportunity.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Okay. And just one last quick one, would cost inflation obviously itâs up significantly year-on-year, is it stabilizing, still getting worse or getting any better?
Robert K. Beckler
Gail, we would still expect to see pretty healthy wood cost inflation in the fourth quarter on the order of magnitude of $8 million to $10 million year-over-year and thatâs really driven by a couple of things, continued wet weather in the Southeast, but more importantly subsidized European palette demand in our wood baskets thatâs really having an impact in that region. So while thereâs â I think there has been some moderation quarter-to-quarter. We still continue to expect higher inflations around wood in that Southeast area.
Gail S. Glazerman â UBS Investment Bank
Okay, thanks very much.
Robert K. Beckler
Yeah.
John A. Luke
Thank you Gail.

Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.
Hi good morning. Itâs actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?
John A. Luke
Good morning.
Robert K. Beckler
Good morning.
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.
Good morning. Can you quantify your profitability goal that you expect to reach for the end of 2015?
John A. Luke
Iâve missed the question. I heard quantify something in 2015.
Robert K. Beckler
Yeah could you repeat?
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.

Yes, sorry. Can you quantify the profitability goal that you were talking about in your prepared remarks that you expect to reach by the end of 2015?
John A. Luke
We havenât â yes, youâre talking about the margins?
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.
Yes, exactly.
Robert K. Beckler
Yes John laid out at the start of the call, what weâre focused on is having performance levels in each of our segments that are at or better than our peers in each of those segments by the end of 2015. And as John stated the way we look at that is really on an all-in basis allocating all of our corporate costs excluding pension income. And we did not specifically set out a range at this point.
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.
Okay, it makes sense. There is still a fair amount of cash on your balance sheet. What do you think as an appropriate level of cash to carry on a normalized basis?
Robert K. Beckler
Well, we just completed a pretty substantial buyback and we look at how we can best economically deploy that cash on a regular basis. As you look at how we operate around the world and while we have, I would say, a very sophisticated global cash management program, the nature of our operations requires us to hold a couple $100 million of cash at a point of time. So there is some capacity there, but itâs modest at this point.
Mehul M. Dalia â Robert W. Baird & Co.
Great, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Alex Ovshey â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Thank you. Good morning everyone.
John A. Luke
Hi, Alex.
Alex Ovshey â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
On the bleached board side, I mean, the industry was trying to push through an open market price increase in the fall, is there an update on how thatâs progressing?
John A. Luke
Beckler?
Robert K. Beckler
Hi, Alex. This is Bob Beckler. Weâve seen the reports obviously I would just say for us itâs still a work-in progress and I wouldnât comment further on specific levels at this stage. Itâs obviously more challenging in the second half of the year than the first wave that came through in the first half of the year that we were very successful with. So weâre still working it. And I think from a fourth quarter perspective, weâll still be up on price year-on-year and backlogs remained firm and weâre going to have to continue to work to address the wood cost inflation particularly that Bob referenced earlier.
Alex Ovshey â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Got it. I appreciate that color. And then inflation side, in the quarter I think youâve reported about $22 million of inflation on the raw material side. Can you just give a little bit of color of how that breaks out between wood and other important inputs? And then just thinking about the energy spectrum and oil prices are lower if thatâs sustainable, how do you see that potentially impacting the cost structure in the business?
John A. Luke
Bob Feeser, do you want to comment on that?
Robert A. Feeser
Sure. In general for the quarter, as we mentioned, wood really represented the majority of that impact year-over-year, but we also saw increases in resin for the quarter that represented the balance, across the board everything else was largely flat benign year-over-year. In terms of oil and the impact on our raw materials going forward, we would expect to see some benefit around logistics and transportation cost going forward.
As a result of that weâve actually seen a bit of a disconnect between oil and natural gas with many of our raw materials over the last five years. So we have seen some benefit with natural gas falling across many of our chemical based raw materials.
Alex Ovshey â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Okay.
John A. Luke
And I would just comment as a footnote to that Alex that as weâve talked over time, you sort through all the puts and takes and Bob Beckler alluded to and itâs going to be very important for us to ensure that our pricing structure reflects inflationary forces that are there. And thatâs a key part of maintaining our zeal towards the market leading margins.
Alex Ovshey â Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Got it John. Thank you very much. Iâll turn it over.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my follow-on. Very quickly this comes up periodically. Can you comment at all in terms of the export markets and whether theyâd become any more challenging for SBS, given the Asian capacity thatâs coming in. I am going to guess the answer is no, given the growth youâre seeing in tobacco board, but if you have any additional color took it off around that positive or negatively?
And then within especially chemicals the FX impact was fairly substantial, could you give us some rules of thumb in terms of FX sensitivity specifically to that segment? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Thank you George, Bob Feeser and then Bob Beckler.
Robert A. Feeser

Sure. Yeah George, in regard to SBS and China dynamic, in general we continue to perform very well in China, Indonesia more broadly, again based on the engineered substrates that we have in tobacco and liquid packaging and our ability to really compete on a differentiated basis versus the Chinese competitors.
We also havenât seen any significant importation of Chinese paperboard into the U.S either thatâs having any meaningful impact on our business, so weâre continuing to monitor that situation closely, but I feel very good about our competitive position.
Robert K. Beckler
On your specialty chem question, actually the effects that impact in specialty chem, is really not altogether difference than in out other businesses, what youâre seeing there on the water fall is reflection of onetime benefit that we had in third quarter of 2013, that were tax and insurance settlement related, so if you strike those out it was pretty much on par with the rest of the business.
Michael Fitzmaurice
Yes, itâs $1 million or $2 million in the quarter.
George L. Staphos â Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, thank you guys.
