Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the IMS Health Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 29, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Kinsley
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the IMS Health third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Ari Bousbib, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today, weâll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our webcast. This presentation will also be available following this call on the Events & Presentations section of our Investor Relations website. The Investor Relations website is easily found in the top right-hand corner of our company's website, imshealth.com.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, October 29, 2015.
Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such forward-looking statements or projections are in fact achieved will depend on future events, some of which are not within the control of the company. 
Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and as such, variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
During the presentation, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and unlevered free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. 
In addition, management believes that these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material, non-cash, unusual or non-recurring items, and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.
These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Once again we have a very active and productive quarter. A few of the highlights included delivering solid financial performance in the quarter, several significant wins in the technology services space, continued good progress integrating the Cegedim acquisition, the strategic alliance with Quintiles to provide best in class real-world evidence data and analytics, and ratings upgrade by Moody's. Now, let's turn to the financials. For the quarter, revenue grew 23% at constant currency. Tech services revenue was up 42% and information revenue about 9%. 
Adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.6%. Excluding the impact of Cegedim acquisition, revenue grew 4.1% at constant currency. This was driven by continued double-digit technology services growth, including strong growth in real-world evidence services, and technology and applications, where we are investing more aggressively not only in product development but also in sales resources, go-to market strategy, and building long-term relationships with our clients. Our goal in tech services continues to be to expand our share-of-wallet with our customers. Information offerings were flat, we're seeing a more cautious pharma market environment. We note a more tentative buying behavior by our pharma customers in certain developed markets and especially in US.
Emerging markets revenue increased 30.5% and developed markets grew 21.5% before the impact of FX. If we exclude the impact of Cegedim, growth in emerging market on the same basis was above 9% and 3% in developed markets. Let me provide some color on our markets successes in tech services. During the quarter, a Top 10 global pharma client signed a $7.5 million deal for combined IMS, tech and apps services, and data capabilities. We will implement IMS technology, automate the client processes and deliver customized analytics to help the clients drive business growth. We also won another multi-million dollar deal with a Top 20 pharma client. They will roll out across 29 countries in Europe, AggregateSpend360, which is a fast growing compliance product we just acquired from Cegedim. We had several mobile intelligence CRM wins in the quarter. This included two mid-sized US clients, an emerging market client, and a mid-sized client in Europe rolling out MI across 25 countries in Europe and five countries in Southeast Asia. These latter wins reflect our efforts to turn around and reposition the mobile intelligence CRM products as part of our multi-application Nexus suite.
In fact, since the Cegedim acquisition, we have had nine head-to-head competitive wins with the leading CRM provider in the US. We won eight of these nine competitions. Now, bear in mind this is the leading competitor who won the larger CRM deals well before we purchased Cegedim. So making significant inroads here will take time as the selling cycles in CRM is typically three, four, five years. However, we are investing aggressively in this area and as we said before, we intend to win over the long-term. On the Cegedim integration front, things are progressing nicely. We continue to engage with Works Councils in various European jurisdictions to move forward with our integration plans there. We expect to begin execution of this plan in Europe by the end of Q1 next year. We now have better visibility on cost take-out opportunities and as a result, we now expect run rate cost synergies of at least $60 million exiting 2017. Our target for 2016 remains $25 million of run rate savings exiting 2016. 
With that, let me turn it over to Ron who will take you through the financials in more detail.
Ron Bruehlman
Okay, thanks, Ari, and good morning, everyone. As Ari mentioned, we had a productive quarter and let me walk you through the details and then I will discuss our guidance for the balance of the year. Our revenue grew to $735 million in the third quarter, an increase of 23% on a constant currency basis. Our technology services offerings growing 42.4% and information offerings growing 8.9%. Excluding the impact of the Cegedim acquisition, our overall constant currency revenue growth was 4.1% with technology services offerings growing 10.1%, displaying solid growth across the portfolio. As Ari mentioned, real-world evidence was particularly strong and we also saw strength in technology and application.
Revenue from information offerings excluding Cegedim and at constant currency was flat in the quarter, reflecting the softer demand in certain developed markets particularly the US that Ari mentioned. At actual foreign currency rate, revenue growth was 12% during the quarter, with technology services revenue growing 31.9% and information revenue declining 2.3%. Excluding the contribution of Cegedim, revenue declined 4.4% reported and tech services grew 3.6%, information declined 10.1%.
Okay, by geography; developed marketsâ revenue was up 21.5%, emerging markets 30.5% at constant currency during the quarter, of course this included the impact of Cegedim, so itâs hurting this. Our developed markets grew 3.1% and emerging markets 9.2%, the latter helped by double-digit growth in China and Brazil. Looking at the geographies at actual FX, developed markets were up 12.2% and emerging markets 11.2% on the same basis, but excluding Cegedim developed markets revenue declined 4.1% and emerging markets revenue declined 5.7%. Our reported growth in emerging markets was hurt in the quarter by a significant depreciation in the Brazilian real. 
Okay, letâs turn to the P&L to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA was $218 million for the quarter, thatâs up 8.6% at constant currency and down 1.5% on a reported basis. Our strong EBITDA growth was helped by our continued sharp focus on cost control, just to offset to the unfavorable impact of slower information revenue growth, as well as continued investments we are making to drive future growth including investments in expanded data assets, investments in development and go to market resources in tech services and competitive pricing across our offering as we continue to invest in client relationships. 
GAAP net income was $43 million during the third quarter compared with $47 million last year and this resulted in GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.13 versus $0.14 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted net income of $129 million was up 10.6% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.38 in the third quarter, up 12.6% at constant currency and 4.9% reported. Foreign currency translation had a $0.03 negative impact which would have been about double that, say, for the benefit of our foreign currency royalty hedges and the natural hedge provided by our euro denominated interest expense. 
Okay, letâs go to the year-to-date results. To give you a brief recap there, revenue for the first nine months was $2.1 billion, which represented growth of 18.3% at constant currency. Our tech services offerings grew 33.9% and information 7.1% on the same basis. Now, if we exclude benefit of Cegedim acquisition, revenue growth was 5.4% year-to-date reflecting tech services growth of 11.4% and information offerings growth of 1.1%. At actual foreign currency rates, revenue grew 7.4% during the first nine months with tech services up 23.8% and information declining 4.2%. 
Looking at the geographies year-to-date at constant currency developed markets grew 17.1%, emerging markets grew 24.3% during the first nine months. The same number excluding the Cegedim acquisition were 4.5% for developed markets and 10.1% for emerging markets. But actual currency rates hurt us during the year as developed markets grew 7.8% at actual rates and emerging markets grew 5.7%. 
Looking at the year-to-date P&L, our adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months was $654 million, up 9.3% at constant FX and down 1.5% at actual FX. Adjusted net income of $390 million increased 29.5% constant currency, 18.6% reported. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.15 in the nine months of the year, up 22.9% at constant FX and 12.6% at actual FX. 
Now, before I discuss the outlook for the balance of the year, letâs take a minute to review the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaled $394 million and the principal amount of debt was $4.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $3.9 billion. Our gross leverage ratio that is our gross debt divided by trailing 12-month EBITDA was 5.0 at the end of September, of course this ratio takes into account only two quarters of Cegedimâs adjusted EBITDA contribution, so it has been few cents lower on a pro forma basis. 
In September, Moodyâs upgraded our corporate family rating, senior secured credit facility and unsecured notes, all by one notch each and this demonstrates Moodyâs confidence in our financial performance, including our strong cash flow generation. In the quarter, cash flow from operations was $111 million while unlevered free cash flow was $141 million or 55% of adjusted EBITDA. 
Now, I should note something, both operating and unlevered free cash flow were negatively impacted by $32 million during the quarter due to changes in the cash balances in two recently acquired royalty program businesses, the larger of which came to us through the Cegedim acquisition. Let me explain. These businesses managed copay reimbursements on behalf of our pharmaceutical customers. 
Our pharma customers prefund [ph] reimbursements, and we included cash on our balance sheet. We draw on this cash to pay pharmacies as consumers use these royalty programs. Now these inflows and outflows should even out overtime, but in any given quarter, like this quarter that could cause meaningful fluctuations in our reported cash flow. 
In the third quarter, absent these outflows, our unlevered free cash flow would have been $173 million or about 80% of adjusted EBITDA. And adjusting for the same factor on a year-to-date basis, increased with our unlevered free cash flow for the first nine months of $433 million or 66% of adjusted EBITDA.
Okay, letâs turn to the 2015 guidance. Our revenue guidance is unchanged from our second quarter call. We continue to expect revenue growth of 19% to 20% at constant currency and about 10% at actual currency. We now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of about 11% at constant currency and about 1% at actual currency and this adjustment from our previous call is driven by two items. 
First, we see our revenue mix shifting more towards technology services in the second half and including somewhat higher Cegedim revenue than we have previously forecast and as you know, this comes with lower margin of information revenue. Second, as a result of converting Cegedimâs accounting from IFRS to US GAAP, we are capitalizing less software development expense than we originally anticipated. Now, this change is purely accounting related as no impact on cash expanded, but simply a reclassification from capital spending to P&L expense.
Now to do the math, this full year guidance implies adjusted EBITDA growth at constant currency in excess of 15% for the fourth quarter. We are now expecting adjusted net income growth of 22% to 23% at constant currency, 10% to 11% at actual currency. For adjusted diluted EPS, we are forecasting growth at 17% to 18% at constant FX and 5% to 6% at absolute currency. And of note, weâve tighten these ranges to the upper end of the previous guidance ranges as our cash tax state for the full year has improved and interest expense and interest rate remain favorable. For our usual practice, our actual FX guidance assumes foreign currency range remain unchanged through the balance of the year. 
Finally, we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow to be between 70% and 80% of adjusted EBITDA and this is after adjusting for any net impact, be it positive or negative from the fluctuations in cash related to the loyalty card program business that I discussed earlier.
So in summary, we had another solid quarter. We delivered strong third quarter financial results. We continue to gain traction in technology services with our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a number of impressive contract wins, we signed an important strategic alliance with Quintiles, which further strengthens our leading position in the rapidly growing real-world evidence market.
We received a net ratings upgrade from Moodyâs. We continue to progress nicely with the integration of Cegedim and as Ari communicated earlier, weâre increasing our synergy target there by another 20% and finally our balance sheet remains solid and we continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the means to invest for growth.
And with that, let me ask Jose to open the lines for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thanks. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
John Kreger
Hi, thanks very much. Ari, could you just expand a bit on your comments, youâre saying clients pull back a bit on information spending in the US. Can you elaborate on what might be driving that greater caution?
Ari Bousbib
Well, I mean John, I don't know for factoring that, but you know that the environment in pharma has become more cautious. Certainly, the markets have been rattled by the number of comments and issues that have come up. How much is that an influence? I don't know. As we know, our info business is 90% subscription-based. So thatâs not really what we're talking about here. 
But 10% of our business is ad-hoc purchases for a variety of studies and a lot of discretionary spend from the budgets of commercial operations at our clients. So we've seen those purchases, which typically come in the second half of the quarter, be a little bit more, weâve seen a more tentative buying behavior in the US and in fact our info business in the US is down more than we had anticipated.
John Kreger
Thank you. And then Ron, you mentioned, if we can think a little bit about maybe an early look at 2016, can you just talk about how your hedges will work. Do we have to be thinking about some sort of a reset of those hedges that would perhaps cause an issue for reported earnings growth next year?
Ron Bruehlman
Yeah. Just to recap, John, we have two types of hedges. One is we hedge the foreign currency royalty stream and the second is a natural hedge provided by our Euro denominated debt and interest expense. And they give us roughly 50% coverage of our foreign currency EBITDA, although the benefit or detriment to the hedges come below the line in interest expense and other income introduction. 
And we put these hedges in place, there is the foreign currency royalty hedges in place on a rolling 12-month basis, so weâre constantly rolling forward and weâre constantly rolling new rates. So of course, hedges don't lock in rates forever, but thatâs of course using the purpose of hedging, the hedging is just to dampen the [indiscernible] a little bit. So obviously as we get into next year, the rates on the hedges will reflect rates that were in place when we put, for instance, in the case of the forwards for the royalty hedges 12 months in arrear, that isnât a problem per se, because as FX rate stabilize, we donât have the big year-over-year drag in revenue and EBITDA that we had this year. Of course thatâs assuming rates stay where they are, no one knows. It gets â the hedges will go in the opposite direction of whatever it is that we experienced on the revenue and EBITDA. Thatâs the purpose of course.
John Kreger
Thatâs very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
Peter Appert
Thanks. Good morning. So, Ari, just staying for a second on the info services business, I think initiative is underway to try to reenergize the revenue growth, the numbers have been trending a little bit lower here for the last several quarters.
Ari Bousbib
Yes, and well, look, again I think the first two quarters was â itâs going to bounce around. Weâve always said itâs going to be a low single digit grower and weâve said when we reported 3% growth, not to get too excited about this and itâs been bouncing around anywhere between the zero and 3% and this quarter itâs flat. When you peel the onion and look at where it is coming from, it is basically holding steady all the over the world essentially, but the US has been an issue. If you look at the US over the past really frankly ever since I have been here, itâs been bouncing around the flat line of plus or minus couple of points, okay, in any given quarter. And again not to draw conclusions from any given quarter, but if you look at the US per se, itâs been literally flat and that has been the case for the past five years every quarter and every quarter, it bounces around in the range of plus or minus a couple of points.
Now, the third quarter was lower than that. So it was in negative territory and outside that band couple of points. And so thatâs kind of unusual. Now, part of the reason we think is the market environment, weâve seen specific purchasing decision that will again postponed, deferred, put on hold. And again more caution if you will within our customers. [indiscernible] the environment that generally causes that, but thatâs just an observation we donât have more visibility to provide more color. The second point that you need to bear in mind is we in many market â we have competition in many markets and as you know, and thatâs more under our control. We have been delivering significant margin expansion over the past five years. And we are in the business not of expanding margins, but it is the business of growing our top line and our bottom line in the long run.
So our guidance is the same which is low single digits for information and low double digits for tech services. We want to grow the whole business according to these parameters. Now in order to do that and weâve expanded our suite of products and tech services, as you know, we have decided we will be making investments and reinvest in some of our cost savings into the business by which I mean, more resources, more support for our growth, as well as frankly use tactical, be more competitive on pricing to win larger deals. With respect to the initiatives, we have our usual initiatives, we are not going to do anything special, we do see the current trend of information in the US continuing into the fourth quarter and this is why weâve adjusted our EBITDA guidance. We are not concerned, we think itâs just a temporary issue due to the market environment, but for the balance of the year, we see the same trends and you might be surprised, but for now thatâs what we see.
Peter Appert
When you say, Ari, more competitive on pricing, are you specifically referring to the information segment or are you speaking more broadly?
Ari Bousbib
I'm speaking broadly.
Peter Appert
Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question
Andrew Steinerman
Good morning, Ari. I wanted to ask you about organic revenue growth in tech services, I know weâre anniversarying most of our small acquisitions, but there are a couple of acquisitions outside of Cegedim. So I was just wondering the 10% constant currency growth in tech services would have been something more like 9% without all acquisitions. Is that about right?
Ari Bousbib
A little less. You mean on the technology services?
Andrew Steinerman
On tech services, how much?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah. You're right. It's more a little over a couple of points.
Andrew Steinerman
So you're saying it's a couple of points? So 10 would be more like, something like that?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. Approximately.
Andrew Steinerman
Okay. And then also could you talk about the breadth of strength, you call that real-world evidence, you call that tech and apps, could you just talk about the two other sub-segments of tech services, how itâs doing in the third quarter organically?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. So the workflow analytics was a little weaker than usual, it is going to bounce around again because itâs less. There is no licenses and so on. Itâs no labor based and it's based on different contracts, when they start and so on and so forth. So not what weâre really concerned, but itâs single digits and consulting again is more -- also same as usual mid-single digits.
Andrew Steinerman
Okay. So they both grow. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Toni Kaplan
Hi, good morning. Can you give some general color on, I guess spending trends within your customer base. So just looking at sort of pharma versus biotech and if weâre seeing any sort of pullback with either of those groups? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Not really, I mean we don't really look at segments. I guess you are asking about the issues on specialty and so on. Ron?
Ron Bruehlman
Yes. Look, we haven't seen any special issues with specialty versus traditional large pharma, but to be honest, we don't track our revenue between specialty and primary care drugs. We sell by therapeutic class and then within therapeutic class, our pricing is based on the frequency, geography, granularity of data and so forth.
And just to put some numbers around it, about 75% of the world market by value is in the primary care drugs and then about 25% is in specialty drugs and our information business, as you might expect, is tilted more towards the primary care drugs because thatâs a much bigger market. There are elements of the specialty market that are technology services part of our business, which are particularly influenced by the specialty market, real-world evidence would we want obviously because given the high prices, specialty drugs, pharma is under a lot of pressure and demonstrate both the therapeutic efficacy and economic efficiency of drugs and real-world use and you saw our announcement with Quintiles and that is a rapidly growing area from what's going on in specialty.
And, there are also things like pricing and market access study. So the short answer is, no, we haven't seen any big difference between the two in terms of growth, but different parts of our business react differently to specialty pharma versus traditional primary care drugs.
Toni Kaplan
Okay. Great. And then I did want to follow-up on the recent collaboration of Quintiles. So just wanted to know what you think the opportunity there is and what you provide to the alliance and what they provide? Thank you.
Ari Bousbib
Well, we are very excited about this alliance. Again, the push for this year has frankly come from our clients. In many, many circumstances, clients are asking us to work together. So this alliance is simply reinforcing the important step in the evolution of our real-world evidence offerings. You know that it is becoming an increasing priority for our clients, as Ron was just explaining it. Payers require that pharma companies demonstrate the effectiveness of the drugs and support the pricing of the drugs.
We already have unmatched data assets, that is what we contribute, we have $500 million anonymous patient record that span longitudinal prescription data, claims data, EMR records and so on. And we also have unique technology, we have our Evidence 360 software that combines these data and creates the customized cohorts of patients. And finally, we have the clinical expertise to analyze the data, so thatâs what we bring to the table. Now, these capabilities primarily focus on real-world evidence study that use historical data base. 
Quintiles on the other hand has complementary prospective research capability. That is, they run a non-interventional trial, which help advance RWE in later stage clinical research. So this alliance essentially enables us to supplement each of the data analytics capabilities when customers need a mix of both prospective and retrospective research. So by doing this, we will create best-in-class data analytics in the real-world evidence space. We think it provides great value to our clients. I think our business in this area is growing very strongly organically. Our Quintiles business in this area is growingly very strongly, I am sure and then so together we think we can even create incremental revenues in each area and creating really, really unique powerful competitor and everyone else is really far behind. 
Toni Kaplan 
Thanks. 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line Paul Ginocchio of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. 
Paul Ginocchio
Thanks. I just want to ask about some of those CRM wins, could you just kind of give us an update, the number of seats where you were before these eight head-to-head wins and then where you are today? Thanks. 
Ari Bousbib
Well, the wins I think that we signed with the clients and I donât have that information for you here. I mentioned these are all of our wins by the way, again, I think I did mention in my prepared remarks, with mid-size clients and they are really all over world, in US, in Europe, in the emerging markets. And the reason for that is, as we know, the competition largely has been ones that we speak by another competitor, thatâs long before we came into the picture. So we have to wait for the new purchases and cycles and we are working actively, feverishly I might say on the strategy. 
I think if you look at overall seats, again, this is before these wins. These wins will add incrementally to our current position, but I think the market share seats that we have is to look at the total of 425,000 seats thatâs what we have, we think that Cegedim has 137,000 seats, thatâs about a 30%, 32% market share. But that includes seats on in on-site, on-premise, non-SaaS CRM. And if you take that out, obviously our market share is on purely SaaS-based CRM, then we are much small. I think the leading competitor on the SaaS is Viva, which has 120,000 seats as we understand and thatâs about 30% share overall, and of course bigger share of the purely SaaS business. I think we still have Oracle and CBOE that have about 65,000 seats thatâs about a 15% share and then a variety of others, another 100,000 about a core of the market is a lot of mom and pops and different local solutions. 
So there is a market out there where people transitioning out of CBOE [ph] or other people and we are going after that market and thatâs usually again itâs going to be mid-sized clients for the most part, and also obviously we are appropriately commercially aggressive there. And as we refine our offerings and become more marketing and go-to-market and sales oriented in the CRM space, perhaps, we think our product is as good or better from a features, functionality and et cetera, point of view and we think we have a variety of advantages. Weâve talked about those before. We have a full suite of applications that work very well with each other and provide a complete view of the customer. We have a true multi-channel perspective and we also have the benefit of being able to pre-integrate our data into all these applications which saves considerable amount of implementation time and cost.
Paul Ginocchio
All right, I appreciate all that detail. Just ask a quick follow-up on the same thing. Those eight wins relative to your existing base is that going to grow a few points or do you think that adds up to 10% or plus growth.
Ari Bousbib
Itâs just a few points, again these are small mid-sized companies, they don't have the type of scale of a large top five or top 10 pharma companies but they are important wins, let me just put it this way, before the acquisition, the win rate wasn't exactly 8 out of 9.
Paul Ginocchio
Perfect thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Stockton
Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I guess Ari, the topic of real-world evidence. It seems like society is kind of accepting that some of these specialty drugs are providing cures but maybe it's having a hard time paying for the cure upfront or paying for just how revolutionary the treatment is upfront. So, I guess I'm wondering if you guys think that over time, we're going to see payment models that stretch out much further than just an upfront payment for these drugs and if there is an opportunity within real-world evidence to only help justify the total value that the managed care company might be paying for a specific drug but also kind of serve as an auditor of whether the cure has been delivered and maybe I don't know if adjudicate is the right word but to manage the process of stream of payments that might extend for years for that treatment. Can you just touch on what --?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, I mean, I think Jamie youâre always very well informed in this area and that's exactly, I mean youâve really articulated it better than I could. That is exactly -- it is exactly what real-world evidence offerings do. We believe we are in the initial evolution of this type and eventually you could imagine a world where most of what we do is exactly what you described, it is not for tomorrow, but long-term, this is exactly where we're going and hence the alliance with Quintiles. You are correct, I mean some of these treatments are very expensive, if you look at the yield or the benefits on a purely economic basis, take the human factor out of here and is it worth prolonging life in another six month, year and a half, two years at what cost.
So again, excluding certain infinite and intangible value of maintaining life even another day, on a true economic basis you wouldn't do, right. So hence the reluctance for payments upfront and kind of pay as you go and having measures and metrics that are sound and deep and analytical and that becomes benchmarks to be able to verify that a treatment on a number of metrics is actually working. And is actually generating value. So that is exactly what our offerings with extremely complex, the population samples by therapy are very, very narrow. So the data is complex to access and has much lower statistical relevance than for primary care and the historic role that we play. And so over time, this is a very, very significant role that we are going to be playing and many people are trying to do to provide that type of service and type of value. We believe we are in a great position to become the reference in this area.
Jamie Stockton
Are you actually seeing any of those types of deals either between you and the pharma company or the managed care company or any of those types of payment models between pharma and Managed Care happening today?

Well, we are not directly involved with payers in that type of work. Our clients here are pharma companies and we support them in their engagement with payers. We are not directly involved in tying the work, the analytics that we do directly with payment terms and structures. We are aware that these are being discussed and negotiated and we provide the supporting evidence and analytics to our clients, the pharma companies and they in turn have the dialog with the Managed Care or the payers and then they do that on their own, so far.

Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. 
Manav Patnaik
Yeah, thank you. Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to reconcile, so I guess if I assume your typical 1% contribution from other M&A, I get 3% total organic growth, 7.5% in the tech services side. Now, I understand the information head when you talked about. On the tech services side, I think in the beginning you probably talked about a lot of these big multi-million dollars wins and the CRM wins and so forth. So I am just trying to reconcile like maybe thatâs just the timing issue where it takes time to ramp up, but I think last year in the third quarter we saw the similar drop down to that 7% level on the organic side. Is there some inherencies now already here or just trying to understand a little bit more whatâs going on there?
Ari Bousbib
Yeah, I mean, look, the first part is exactly what you said which is that the wins donât translate into immediate dollars in our revenue or EBITDA, right. Itâs going to take time and these are multiyear contracts. In fact, in the early days, early period of multiyear contract where we have a lot of technology to implement, typically this comes with lower revenue and sometimes negative EBITDA because we are investing and putting in best technology if itâs a new deployment, if itâs a new client et cetera. So we make the investment upfront. Itâs also true that when we help a client switch over from another technology to ours, and I have examples, we often obviously we want to make it painless for the client, so we take on the cost of that or significant part of the cost of that switch. And so therefore, in the early days, you are not going to see that for these two reasons, the multi-year contracts and number two, at the beginning we are investing in the implementation. So you are not going to see that right away in the numbers. Remember, so the wins are going to increase. It is not like immediately it is going to translate into higher revenue and EBITDA, but certainly a year hence you can start seeing the benefits of those wins. 
Now, with respect to the second part of your question, which has to do with potential seasonality in the quarters, because you see a pattern, yeah, look, we donât really know why that is so but typically there is less activity in the summer and they â our strongest quarters have been and it is true both in information and in tech services. Our strongest quarters have been the first and the fourth quarter. And the third quarter has typically been the weakest in that respect. I canât tell you why, but that is what happened, itâs true.
Manav Patnaik
Okay, and then just on the M&A side of things, you talked about your desire to sort of move more into the payer provider side of things. Just curious on your current talk there, obviously it seems like there is another asset out there that comes up sale for sale every day, so just wanted your updated thoughts on your timing and level of aggression if you get into that space.
Ari Bousbib
Look, we said before itâs a very different space. Weâve been looking at it for a while. I think weâve discussed this before, Manav, and you know Iâve said it in different forms that itâs an area where we think we can bring capabilities, itâs a large market, but obviously a different market with a lot of competitors that come from different angles. And we see some companies trying to get rid of those assets because they are not really able to make them grow to sufficiently attractive rates or to make enough money from it. So itâs not an easy business. We also see companies that grew dramatically and then hit a wall, because these are relatively finite niche markets. So weâve become a lot more educated and we have looked at every, the soon that weâre looking at every asset, that is being put up for sale, but we've said before and we continue to say, weâre not going to buy stuff that is just not good and weâre now going to buy a thing, that is good, but itâs hugely expensive, simply because the market is what it is and people are willing to invest in those companies at the early stages and at very high valuations and we just are not. So that's the limiting, if an opportunity shows up and itâs the right time and the valuations become more reasonable, then we might consider it.
Manav Patnaik
All right. Thanks a lot, Ari.

Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.
David Larsen
Hey, guys. I think you notched up the Cegedim synergies estimate a bit. Can you talk about the sources of those incremental synergies and could those rise even higher in 2017? Thanks.
Ari Bousbib
Okay. Well, look, we've always said weâre very excited by this acquisition. There is great operational overlaps with us and our initial take, which was given to you before we had a chance to really go deep into the company was $50 million run rate synergies in year three that is coming out of 2018. We, since then, implicitly upped that number 20% to $60 million, simply because again the initial $50 million cost take-out was assessed on the basis of the euro rate that was at 1.32 per dollar. And the euro rate, as you know, has gone down 20%. 
So we didnât change that $60 million and accordingly, you can assume that if everything else has been equal, we would have told, well, the $50 million energy is now full. But we said itâs still 50. Now, since then, we've gone in and the sources of these cost reductions are pretty straightforward. They are in 70 countries, weâre in 100 countries. The 70 countries are a subset of the 100. We don't need two infrastructures, two sets of offices, two sets of IT assets, et cetera. 
So again, we have a straightforward overhead real estate, IT infrastructure consolidation efforts. And that was the source of our initial $50 million. Now since then, we have realized that we can do more than that. We could also integrate our go-to market strategy, not could, but we should integrate our go-to market strategies and really provide the customer with one face to the customer and provide the full set of products, including our information offerings. 
And that is more complicated to do because you need expertise, especially the more technology content there is, the more strategic need in your sales force and so we've been working with different models and we're figuring out that that would enable us to take another $10 million of costs out of the system when we optimize our go-to market strategy. So that's the source of the incremental synergies. 
So net-net, if you take into account the euro rate drop of 20% and this increase, we really upped our synergy estimate from 40 to 60 and we also did the second thing is that we started integrating in the US and in jurisdictions where we don't need works councilâs consultations and we believe that assuming consultations are going very well, so we believe that we can start in Europe sometime next year hopefully, end of, say, first quarter, beginning of second quarter and therefore weâre now more optimistic as to how fast we can get to the run rate and we think that run rate could be there by the end of â17 as opposed to â18. 
So we've done two things, we've upped the amount of costs that we've seen we can take out and we have also shorten the duration to get there. Now, I want to caution you 2016 is not going to see more synergy than what we said before, we think it's about $25 million run rate savings at the end of â16, exiting â16, and the fact that we increasing our overall synergy rate doesn't change anything to that $25 million number because we still have to do a lot of integration and are really an execution during the 2016.

Our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Hi, thank you very much for squeezing me in. Hey Ari, given the small size of this CRM win, is there some underlying unifying theme over there that which youâd believed that when you get into the larger wins and perhaps the incumbent will put in more resources that you'll have a similar type of win rate or at least a much more competitive win rate?
Ari Bousbib
Look, obviously it's good question we don't know. And obviously it's a lot harder to dislodge an incumbent than compete, so to speak on the equal footing, right that's number one. And number two, obviously an incumbent is going to put a lot more efforts in defending their larger position than in winning an incremental smaller account. That's also true. So we agree with you there. While we hope that, we investing aggressively and once again, weâre not in this business to grab the margins, we are in this business to win it a long-term. So, we'll see hopefully, I know that we won eight out of nine, also big ones, but hopefully we have a better win rate than they had before. And certainly the fact that you know while I said that we will compete on equal footing for this mid-sized, it's only partially true because the leading player obviously can simply showcase what theyâre doing with the big guys. So if youâre a small you typically want to do what the big guy does. So to certain extend I think that will raise, I think itâs significant for us and that it shows the power of our combined suit of offerings and of the pre-integrated data. And again, weâre being appropriately, stood commercially and doing what we can and putting more resources and so on to improve our win rate. Thank you Shlomo.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Just I want to ask a little bit about the comments on pricing and investments and relationship. I mean, in terms of interpreting that should be assume that this is just a global focus for you guys and thatâs going to be, youâre going to be more competitive on pricing and we should as we model the company forward take that into account into the gross margins and is there something thatâs uniquely different right now or it seems that your strategy is kind of leaning in that direction. Thank you.
Ari Bousbib
So I wouldn't draw long-term conclusions anyway but listen, the technology space is very competitive and I said again many times that we are going to win here and we want to win on the strength of our products, on the strength of our integrated suite of applications, on the strength of our pre-integrated data, on the strength of our implementation capabilities in 100 countries which few competitors have. So all of these are value elements, now when you sell large deals, multi-million dollar deals over seven years and needless to say, it's tough negotiation with our clients, and in the past if someone was selling one application, CRM suite for example, they might not have been as competitive as could have been and look we're taking a lot of cost out and I think it would be the wrong decision tactically, again, the project decisions we make are tactical, theyâre not -- there is no blanket policy as you seem to suggest that we're going to apply that, we don't do that. Obviously we want to obtain the higher price possible but tactically when there is a large deal to win, we are not prepared to do a deal with our clients that make sense for them and make sense for us as you would expect us to do. And we have the capability to that because we launch and weâre taking a lot of cost out and we have good profit margins.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Is there a change in the cash tax going forward Ron?
Ron Bruehlman
In the cash tax rate, we've been telling you high teens. For the year, weâre thinking it's more in the range 15% to 17% average for the full year, which is a little better than what we told you. We've done some nice things on tax strategy, some of its just mix between countries, we have received some refund, so itâs a combination of factors. So yeah, this year, I think that will be a little bit lower than what we signaled for a longer-term average. So for the full year in the 16% to 17% range. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Thank you so much.
Ari Bousbib
Thanks, Shlomo.
