Good day and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems third quarter 2015 earnings conference call and webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO, and Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the discussions might contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represents management's beliefs and assumptions concerning future events. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statement due to many factors.
Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Please note that we have posted our statistical supplements to the IR section of our website heartlandpaymentsystems.com, which includes details on both our consolidated results as well as with respect to our business segments. In addition, a presentation that Bob Carr will use during his remarks is available in the IR section on our website and can be accessed via the link provided in the press release this morning. I suggest you access the link and pull the slide deck to follow Bob's remarks.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland.
We achieved record earnings and outstanding growth in the third quarter. Adjusted net income was $29.7 million or $0.79 per share with adjusted net income growing 20% and adjusted earnings per share up 16% compared to the third quarter of last year. From a top line perspective net revenue was up 27%. This growth was delivered by a solid organic growth complemented by the strategic acquisitions we completed over the past year. Indeed our organic growth was once again double-digit continuing to demonstrate a business model that is sustainable and scalable.
From an operating margin perspective, I am also pleased that we were able to achieve levels that are highest compared to any quarter in the past two years. A momentum we will continue to build on as revenue continues to grow, and the operating leverage in our business model becomes more visible. We continue to make progress executing on our strategy across all business lines. Heartland Commerce is a segment that we provided and update on recently, and I'm pleased to let to you know that revenue in each of these businesses that make up Heartland Commerce also experience sequential growth. We are also beginning to see some POS customers beginning to convert their payment processing and payroll services to Heartland. It is still early on, but the movement is in the right direction. Of course, we are a merchant advocate, and offer an open platform. We enable our POS merchants and our POS dealer partners to process with whatever partner they select, provided that they are not an unwilling victim of the deceptive trade practices that are becoming increasingly more well known in the industry. Samir will discuss our financial and operational results in more detail and hence, I would like to spend the rest of my time here this morning to discuss an achievement that has been long in the making and is a positive indicator for the future organic growth ahead of Heartland. I would like to spend time on our installed margin results for the quarter and in particular, the level achieved last month in September.
So, please turn to the slide deck that's available on our website or by clicking on the URL that's in this morning's press release and please start with slide two. For the third quarter, we once again achieved all-time record new installed margin, which totaled $27.7 million in the quarter, up nearly 30% from the third quarter of 2014. This is the highest velocity of new business growth in nearly two years and was achieved despite starting from a much higher base. It is one thing to grow 30% from a small base and quite another to grow 30% from a much larger base.
As seen on the slide, in the month of September, our sales organization reached the $10 million mark of new installed margin and broke the single-month new record â new margin installed record for the fourth consecutive month and, by the way, there were no outsized merchant signings to account for this. So, how did this happen? There were more successful sales people and more successful divisions, signing business, and payments, and payroll. Our sales model has attracted more great sales professionals and the pace of that continues to increase as well. In other words, we expect this $10 million mark to be our formatted mile. We expect to break this $10 mark again and again. Year-to-date, new margin installed now totaled $73.2 million and we are in pace to break $100 million for the year. This would be an increase of 20% from the previous record set last year of $83.4 million.
Please turn to slide three. I frequently ask Bob, how does Heartland do this? And here you can see the answer is really straight forward. It is the credibility we have established with current and future sales professionals with our compensation model, known here in Heartland as the '94 plan. This sales compensation model created in 1994 is still unique in the marketplace and we have not changed it in any fundamental way for all these years. We do not plan changing it as long as it continues to meet the needs of the business.
This stability is not only important to our current sales professionals, but it is also instrumental in attracting top sales talent. When we initially introduced the '94 plan there were a fair share of skeptics, those who felt our signing bonus and commission were far too lucrative for our relationship managers. But I believe in a sales model that treated everyone equitably; the merchants, the sales professionals as well as the company where our relationship managers can make a good living by sharing in our success.
It's a plan that gets everyone pulling in the same direction. When we first implemented this plan, I had a personal goal of eventually achieving $10 million in new margin installed per month. This was aspirational and was a goal that was establishment many years ago and therefore achieving this milestone is a very special accomplishment here at Heartland.
Please turn to slide 4. We are proud of the work we are doing in many, many relationship managers and now SPAs who have financially benefited from this '94 plan. But once in a while, it's also nice to see your achievements receive some recognition. So I'm proud to say that's just recently, we were once again named the number one organization to sell for in the United States. This is the second year in a row we have earned this distinction from the highly regarded industry periodical Selling Power, and it's the fifth time in the last eight years that we have been named number one. We are proud of this distinction, as it is based on a lot of the same attributes we value most, an equitable culture, our talent, our training, our compensation model, and our advanced sales tools.
Over the years, as we have grown and our markets have evolved, our sales organization has also grown and evolved, continually trying and testing various enhancements to improve our performance while remaining true to our values. Along the way we have learned many valuable lessons. For instance, in 2012 we created our sales operations team. This team has made remarkable progress improving the productivity and efficiency of our entire sales organization, f
From Atlas, the industry's most innovative technology platform, to training and recruiting programs, sales ops has helped develop and refine our process to bring in better talent, train them better, and give them the tools and support they need to be successful. Most importantly, they have made it a repeatable and scalable process.
To support our growth, we've kept a nimble and lean organizational structure. And while we have experienced tremendous growth over the past several years, we have added only one new region in the process. The flexibility inherent in our regional structure provides the organizational bandwidth to support our growth. And we've added new products to the relationship managers' portfolio.
In payroll, we introduced the SPA concept, which has been incredibly successful, have been growing from 34 reps to over 150 reps today. These SPAs are the very best payroll reps and managers in the business and have provided the support our relationship managers need to install more new payroll margin. And since February 2014, we have been building our Trusted Dealer program. Our business development team has been doing a great job building this channel and the creation of Heartland Commerce. We have shifted this effort into overdrive.
Earlier this year, on slide five, we saw an opportunity to further strengthen our sales organization. Built on our unique '94 plan and managed by a team of motivated and proven sales VPs, we began to grow outside of Heartland and began to add a new group of division-level talent. This has proven to be transformative. We abandoned our notion â my notion that our sales managers had to home grown, and this has allowed us to get perspectives that we have never had in the past.
Division managers are given the responsibility of recruiting new relationship managers while assuring their division achieves its production and efficiency targets. The results have obviously been pretty remarkable. Despite the addition of many new rookie relationship managers, the division manager structure has enabled us to maintain and improve our average margin installed per relationship manager.
In fact, in September we broke our all-time record with 679 sales professionals hitting our minimum sales goals for a relationship manager. Over the first half of this year, we increased our division manager staff from 73 to 97. This has enabled us to maintain the success of our relationship managers and offers a blueprint to further grow the sales organization while remaining highly productive.
Now I'd like to speak to that famous 80:20 rule, you know that rule that says that 80% of your new business comes from the top 20% of your sales organization. In September it took us the top 59.8% of our salespeople to produce 80% of our sales. Believe me that we have a very strong top 20% at Heartland, but the next 40% are very effective as well. If only 20% of your people are doing 80% of your business, I think you're doing something wrong. The 80:20 rule means that a lot of people are failing, and a failing sales organization is not an indicator of a healthy company in my view. So we are extremely proud at Heartland to have an 80:60 rule.
Let's go to slide six. Using a very basic concept, Heartland's underlying principles now support an organization of 1,403 highly motivated and productive sales professionals. Where do we go from here? Again, a pretty simple answer; we will continue to hire leaders in geographies where we are underrepresented to build new teams. We have a very active campaign in search of superior talent that fits our culture and wants to grow. The bad news is that Heartland does not have deep penetration in every U.S. market. The good news is that there is major growth ahead of us as we continue to reduce that number of poorly penetrated markets.
We will build and sell more products in more markets, from payroll SPAs to an inside sales organization to a national sales organization. We are also adapting to our emerging market opportunities. With Heartland Commence, we're opening a tremendous new growth market that will naturally spawn additional markets as technology and the cloud enable us to convert former batch financial services to more valuable real-time and actionable services. This is at the core of our excitement about the future of Heartland.
And finally, while I did not spend much time on it today, we are in the early stages of flexing our marketing muscle. Along with security and out-of-scope and Heartland Commerce, marketing has been a key investment priority this year. And we've gotten pretty darn good at marketing, if I don't say so myself.
Slide seven, at the end of the day we are looking to attract the right folks that fit our culture, and want to grow with us. We've done a pretty good job so far, we think, we can do even better. Finally, I am pleased to announce that we have acquired a great company: Digital Dining. A national provider of restaurant POS and management systems, Digital Dining offers restaurants the convenience of a hand held POS, on an iPad, an iPhone, an iPod, and an iPad mini in a hybrid environment with conventional fixed terminals, and is also used by restaurateurs for table management, delivery, reservations, labor scheduling, inventory and loyalty programs.
This acquisition strengthens Heartland's ability to provide our customers with one of the industry's largest set of effective, transparent, and honest commerce solutions. Digital Dining will be integrated into Heartland Commerce allowing us to gain operational synergies, substantially grow our commerce footprint, and continue our leadership in exceeding our customers' requirement of superior services and products.
And with that now, I'd like to turn it back to Samir.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Bob. Let me give you highlights of the results for the quarter. Overall Heartland delivered another solid quarter. Adjusted net income and related earnings per share were $29.7 million and $0.79 per share respectively. This was an increase of 20% and 16% respectively, compared to the third quarter in the prior year. It is important to note that included in the prior year results was a net gain of $0.05 related to Leaf, primarily for a settlement of an earn-out obligation. As a reminder, adjusted results add back stock based compensation and acquisition related amortization expenses.
Third quarter results were driven by strong growth across mostly performance indicators. Total consolidated net revenue for the third quarter was $214.6 million, an increase of 26.7% over the prior year. With organic net revenue growth of 11.3% for the quarter, which was a continuation of the double-digit organic growth achieved this year.
Payment processing net revenue increased by 12.5% in the quarter, an acceleration from 11.3% in the second quarter, and driven by a 13.4% increase in SME card processing net revenue. Which was also an acceleration from 12% reported in the second quarter. This increase reflected growth of 13.1% and SME card transaction processing volume. Our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-growth in processing volume, and was a result of solid increases in installed margins, growth in same-store sales, and continued improvement in net volume attrition.
With respect to installed margin, we once again achieved an all-time record level, which was $27.7 million in the quarter, up nearly 30% from the third quarter 2014. This was the fastest new business growth in two years, and was achieved despite starting from a much higher base. As Bob mentioned in September, Heartland achieved the milestone of $10 million installed margin. Same-store sales were up 4.1% in the quarter, and net volume attrition declined to 9.1%. Excluding the benefit of same-store sales, our growth volume attrition declined by 120 basis points and reflected the effectiveness of our portfolio management and retention program.
In the aggregate, net revenue for our Non-Payment Processing segments grew by 61% in the quarter, including the benefit of acquisitions. Excluding such acquisitions, net revenue grew by over 8%. This is lower than the typical organic growth collectively delivered by non-card processing segment and the reason for the shortfall was all attributed to Heartland School Solutions, which I will discuss shortly. However, excluding Heartland School Solutions, organic growth for the quarter was 14%.
Let me now touch up on the net revenue in each of these business units. Beginning with Heartland Payroll, net revenue was up 41%, while organic growth was 15%, which was in line with our expectations and reflected the continued success we experienced since we implemented the strategy of having payroll dedicated sales people. It is important to know that we have recently accelerated the expansion of the payroll sales team and hence, believe we have strong momentum heading into the key end of the year selling season.
Heartland Campus Solutions, total net revenue grew by 119% in the quarter, organic growth accelerated to 17%, marking the third consecutive quarter of sequential year-over-year revenue growth. TouchNet is performing as previously guided and we continue to be pleased with the cross-sell opportunities between the various business lines within this segment.
Heartland School Solutions net revenue declined 3% in the quarter. This decline was mainly a reflection of lower equipment related revenue and lower software maintenance revenue, partially offset by an increase in payments revenue. The equipment related revenue in the prior year included the City of Chicago and few other districts. The lower maintenance revenue was timing related and we expect to catch up in the fourth quarter. Payments revenue grew at 8.5%, which was also lower than the double-digit growth typically achieved. We noted that a later than usual back-to-school start, compared to last year resulted in single-digit growth in transaction process. Based on our view since the end of the quarter, we believe that these seasonal timing differences will reverse and we will revert to the double-digit growth we previously guided.
Net revenue of Heartland Commerce, which was included in other segments was $9 million in the quarter, up on a sequential basis from $7.7 million in the second quarter. Dinerware, pcAmerica and XPIENT each experienced sequential revenue increases in the quarter. As we continue to execute our Heartland Commerce strategy, we expect this division to become an engine of growth.
As Bob mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Digital Dining today. This acquisition will add over 10,000 customer locations and annual revenue of $5 million to Heartland Commerce.
Now for a few expense highlights, processing and servicing expenses in the third quarter increased 23.8% in total, 41% of which was driven by acquisitions and the remaining component was related to overall growth of our business, increases in sales compensation which was driven by the outstanding performance of our sales organization, as well as expenses incurred as part of our efforts to accelerate the increase in the size of our sales team. The increase in customer acquisition costs also reflected the outstanding sales performance as well as the increase in same-store sales and lower attrition.
General and administrative expenses were up approximately 20% in the quarter, increasing at a rate that is considerably less than the rate at which costs increase over the first half of this year. The increase reflected costs inherited with the various acquisitions and investments being made in Heartland Commerce marketing and various security initiatives. However, many of these royalties are fixed costs that have essentially stabilized in line with our previous indications. The spending on these initiatives would be heavier in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year.
The other factor accounting for the increase was incentive compensation, which have increased this year in line with the strong financial performance at both the total and business unit level.
A breakout of depreciation and amortization expense by income statement line item is included in the statistical supplement. While you will see that, total third quarter 2015 depreciation and amortization expense excluding amortization of our acquired intangible increased by $1.8 million from a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $52.1 million up nearly 40% from a year ago. While our adjusted operating margins was 24.3%, a 230 basis points improvement from 22% in the third quarter of 2014.
Management measure of operating cash flow for the quarter was, $47.6 million up 29.4% from the third quarter of last year. Our total debt outstanding as of the end of the quarter was $499 million, down $54 million sequentially from the end of the previous quarter and follows a paydown of $37 million during the second quarter.
Our strategy is to use our cash flow to reduce borrowing and financial leverage as well as to consummate strategic acquisitions. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.6 million and in line with our guidance for the year.
Let me wrap up with our guidance for 2015. For the full year, we expect to deliver net revenue growth in excess of 20% and be between $810 million and $815 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.86 to $2.89. The guidance assumes after-tax share based compensation and acquisition related amortization expenses reduced earnings per share by $0.65 for the year and a tax rate of approximately 39%. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Bob for some closing remarks before opening up for questions.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Samir. After â before concluding our remarks, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share payable December 2015 to stockholders of record on November 24. And once again, I would like to thank all of the great Heartland team members who are driving these powerful and positive results. And most importantly those who helped us break the four minute mile at Heartland.
And now, Andrew, we're ready to open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
The first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. One thing I can say for sure Bob is I'm never going to run a four minute mile, so. Question for you on the margin in the Payment business, especially as we've seen a lot of EMV-related growth, especially in the third quarter. Could you talk a little bit about Heartland's experience with EMV, how much revenue generates for you, what the revenue sources are, and specifically what the profitability on those revenue streams is, and whether or not that's effecting the segment margin at this point?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Go ahead.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Andrew, maybe I will start with the answer, and then, Bob and Bob can add. As you know, the EMV shift has been sort of once in a long-term event where all of our customers, or most of our customers will have to change. The introduction of Heartland Secure was and particularly important for Heartland has resulted in an achievement with respect to adding more and more customers, has really helped. Certainly the sales and productivity as Bob has mentioned has been there to make sure that we take advantage of this event, but overall, when you look at the equipment sales, Heartland Secure equipments have been selling at an exceptionally high level. We don't make a significant amount of margin on these equipments, but certainly we're making the margins on adding more and more customers every single quarter.
If you're looking at margins overall from the Payments business, the operating leverage in our business is certainly significant, and you would see the margin expanding. However, as we mentioned at the beginning of this year our investment in marketing, the expansion of the sales team as well as just more investment in the Heartland Secure, you could see that the margins with respect to that Payments business alone is not where it would be. As we exit this spending, the operating leverage will become a lot more visible, and you will see that in the quarters to come.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. So, given the size of that segment relative to the rest of the business, we shouldn't think about a 24% EBIT margin as being through the high watermark for Heartland's profitability?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
No, no. When you look at the Payments business, you would typically see a conversion on a normalized basis without increased investments, I mean, you would always to maintain certain level of expenses, but you would see a conversion of revenue, increased revenue down to the operating income line between 40% and 60%, and that's something that we would expect to see in the future as we complete the investments that we talked about.
Robert H. B. Baldwin - Vice Chairman
Can I just add on the EMV side, I think it creates a fertile ground for the Heartland Secure discussion with the merchant. And so we are seeing high levels of sales of equipment. As Samir mentioned, that's not business that we try to make a lot of money on. But I think that the installed margin â the $10 million number was certainly assisted by that better â more fertile ground on the merchant side.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And I would just â I think the most powerful part of EMV for Heartland is our out-of-scope solution, which takes the POS out of the equation in terms of having PII. And it really reduces the complexity for the merchant of PCI compliance and reduces the cost as well. And that's a transformative technology. We're not the only ones out there, but we're I think as much of a leader as anybody. And I think we're first to market with that out-of-scope solution too.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Is there a subscription-based tail on that, Bob, or is that again â are we talking about this all being wrapped up in this EMV demand bulge?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It's sort of wrapped up, Andrew. The other side of the coin here is that we have spent a lot of money in development, which is all being capitalized and depreciated and amortized. So the plus on the revenue side is offset more by the expense side, but I think Bob hit the point is that it's created a lot of discussion in the marketplace, and that always helps. When merchants are reevaluating their system, we're in good shape to compete for the new business.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay, and just one more quick one, Samir. Heartland Commerce having broken even this quarter, Digital Dining notwithstanding, are we at a level at which you can begin to scale, or is it too early to say that?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
It's still too early. We are pleased to see that there was sequential revenue growth, but we're still making investments in streamlining the product roadmap. That division will become a breakeven category in 2016.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay, thank you very much.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Sure.
Operator
The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hey, guys, great job again. I guess the gross margin install is amazingly strong. That's great to see. Can that set-up for the Payments segment? I know it's been growing over 10%, a little bit of OptBlue benefits this year. But can that sustain 10% plus growth into next year of gross margin installed stays this strong?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Certainly, when we map out this installed margin and we look at hopefully similar type of performance over the next little while or even much longer, and you look at the same type of same-store levels and continued decline in our attrition, we do expect that type of revenue to be in the double digits. Same-store sales is the one that would be somewhat not entirely directly within our control. It is obviously subject to the market. And when I look at the same-store ranges, that would be the difference between the low end and the high end of the range of growth in that business.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great, and then I guess a quick modeling question around Digital Dining. How much revenue is expected in Q4 and annually really from that? And then also despite a lot of investments still going on, I'm just wondering. The margin expansion into next year, it's really good this year. But is there a lot of investment that we shouldn't expect like 200 bps or anything next year? So I guess both the Digital Dining thing, and then margins?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So on the Digital Dining, as I mentioned, it's over $5 million a year in terms of revenue. And so you would need to calculate what does it mean for the rest of this year, David. In terms of the overall margin expansion, if you're mentioning 200 basis points on an overall basis, that may be at the high end. I would say we will begin to see the margin expansion. What's happened this quarter is a testament that we are on the right track. We expect that to continue, and I especially look at it on an annualized basis. But increasing the margin by 200 basis points next year would be at the high end from a modeling point of view.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Having said that, as I mentioned, these investments are tapering off. Heartland Commerce will be the one business that could change things, and that's the function of ability to add payments revenue and payrolls revenue which, as Bob mentioned, we have solid early indications on that, and that's still early stages. But if we continue to start selling more than the point-of-sale to these customers, then that would make a big difference in terms of the margin expansion. But even excluding that, we should see margin expansion next year.
David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got you, great. Thanks, for great job.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please, go ahead.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC
Great, thanks for taking my question, guys, and congrats on another nice quarter. I was hoping you could update us now as to how big the dealer network is for your point-of-sale products. And I know you said we're in the early stages of actually selling the payment service into a lot of these installs. Is there any way to quantify that? How low is the penetration right now from some of those recent acquisitions that you've done throughout the course of the year?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I was talking about the 80:20 rule. With the dealer communities that we've inherited and are building, it's more like the 10:90 rule or 90:10 rule. There are many, many dealers that just don't do a lot of volume, and obviously we want to help them improve.
One of the great things about â Digital Dining is a legendary company in the restaurant business. They started back in the 1980s. When I started in the business, they were contemporaries, and Graham [Granger] and Kay [Branson] had just built a tremendous business with a lot of loyal dealers, but many inactive dealers as well.
So as the industry is moving to the SaaS model, which we want to help increase the velocity of that, a lot of the dealers have not really been able to keep up with things and their cloud based systems out there have been challenging to these dealers. We think we can bring all that together and really resurrect a lot of the dealers in terms of their engagement with the companies that we've acquired there. So it's an opportunity for growth. It's not, the dealer network is not strong, I'll put it that way, but we believe we have the ability to make it very strong over the next 6 months to 24 months.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, sort of shifting gears on the margin front. I know you guys said you're investing in the payroll business, you're sort of growing your sales there. How should we think about margin expansion for that business going into â going into 2016? And are there any sort of one-off type items? I know you've had sort of the Heartland Summit expenses this year, but anything we should be aware of from a modeling perspective going into 2016 that may show up on more of a temporary or one time basis? Thank you.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So maybe I'll start with the payroll margins. As â if you look at the margins on the overall Payroll business, they have declined from last year; they declined from Q1. That's because we added Payroll 1, which as a division they have typically lower â as they stand today, they have lower margins than our core Payroll business.
As we execute on the integration, as we had mentioned before, that the margins on the Payroll are going to go back to the same levels that they had been previously and impact higher. Business is all about scale and we will â we're starting to get to the point where, just like in payments, an incremental cost for processing a payroll transaction is much lower than the all-in cost. So there is definitely a solid operating leverage in that business as well and -- but it is also about scale.
So we need to add a lot more payroll transactions. Once we integrate Payroll 1 and continue to build that business, you will see the margins of that business continue to grow hopefully to the level of where the company overall is right now.
In terms of one-time items for next year, we have the Summit as we mentioned that happens every other year. While we have also given the size of the sales organizations, we are also planning to have a sales conference, maybe just a more -- the Heartland Summit has become a big corporate event. In between the Heartland Commerce, we will make a sales conference, you need to keep those types of activities in â on a going forward basis. And that is going to happen during Q1 of this year, but the cost of that will be much less than what it would be for the Heartland Summit. So the Heartland Summit will be every other year and in between, there will be a sales conference, that will be on a much smaller scale and much less expensive.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Will that be noticeable on the margin front or just probably not even worth calling out or?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
It's better than â I don't think it is worth of calling out.
George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC

The next question comes from of Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks and good morning. Two questions. One, just back on the payroll topic. I don't remember if you mentioned in this call, but when we talk about the growth plans there and hiring the sales people, is there anything sort of definitive around the strategy around cross selling into the existing merchant base versus just calling out and trying to go out after Greenfield opportunity. You could comment on whether in terms of strategy or where you're at in those efforts so far, how you think about that and then I have a follow up.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we certainly have a lot of experience with the cross selling and non-cross selling payroll to our merchant base. I think the big driving factor, Tim going forward is that, with the point-of-sale, we now have the time clocks of these businesses, because the POS systems are time clocks, where they're connected to the time clocks. And that allows us to know what's growing out in real-time with payroll. So time and attendance, which we've always offered, which never really gained traction, it wasn't all that valuable. Now it's incredibly valuable, because with the point-of-sale, we can tell the manager of the business how their overtime is growing hour-by-hour, how their labor management costs are relative to their budget.
We also can help them with employee scheduling and calculating the wages at the end of every day, the earned but unpaid wages. So there's functionality that's not available to the small guys now, the big guys have these features and capabilities, the beauty of XPIENT, of that acquisition was it gave us these tools. And now we've got to bring them down market to the smaller operator who needs that functionality just as much as the big guy to run a successful business.
So I think, it's changing, I'd love to tell you that we have solved the problem of selling back-in back payroll services to our payments customers, but that's not what's happening. I think, where we have the opportunity for a lot of cross selling is through the point-of-sale, and that's why we're in this business and growing that business obviously. That's where you're going to see the real traction and I think it's going to be significant.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, and then a follow-up, just going to the restaurant vertical. Just how, I guess curiosity as you look at your restaurant base, what percentage of those merchants you think ultimately would be interested in some of the stuff like order ahead, pay ahead that we're starting to see some of the larger guys like Starbucks, et cetera, do. And to what degree is that a high margin or high revenue yield product for you. If you have that capability over to build out, just any thoughts there?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We do have that capability both for smaller operators, and the bigger ones. We're prepared to, we're thinking that it's going to become very common and sort of table stakes. And one of the benefits of Digital Dining is they have so much experience in so many small and larger merchant segments than we've had in the past.
So, I think it's going to be significant. I think we're in a transformative era here â because the cloud enables a whole lot of stuff that you could never really do before. And our whole goal is to move things to the cloud as we can, not a revolution but an evolution to the cloud.
Timothy Wayne Willi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great, that's all I had. Thanks very much, guys.

The next question comes from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Yes, thank you and good morning. I'm wondering on the EMV revenue tailwind that you guys are getting right now, how long do you think that benefit is going to last since the smaller merchants have kind of been slow in upgrading so far in the EMV?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not sure that there has been a tail of EMV revenue. What's happened is that, the merchants are talking â merchants who wouldn't talk to us in the past are talking to us now because they don't â they need to make a change. And there is very a small percentage of these small merchants that have made the change. And it's going to take a while to get everybody on board here.
In October, it's the first month that we've had chargebacks going against merchants that because they're not enabled with EMV. That's going to pick up and be more and more. And when merchants get their first chargeback because they took a counterfeit card, they don't understand it, they don't think they have counterfeit card issues right now.
So I think we have a long period here. I think we're looking at 6 months, 18 months â for 6 months for sure, probably more like 18 months of more and more small merchants looking at their alternatives and dealing with these counterfeit chargebacks and then of course the petro revolution starts in 2017. So, I think we got a couple of years ahead of us where this activity is going to help us, because we have the feet on the street. This isn't something you sell through the internet. It's not a digital marketing sale. It's explaining to the merchant what the impact is for them. They have to change out their hardware through you. They want to talk about Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and the whole nine yards there as well. So it just creates tremendous opportunity for us, and I think it's going to be out there for a couple years ahead of us.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Thanks for that. And just to piggyback on that, I think it's becoming clear that payments is just becoming more complex and you guys being the last mile connecting up the small mid-size merchants, it seems like you're doing a lot more for the merchants in terms of security, mobile payment solutions. And I'm just wondering, how are you guys thinking about the pricing model? I mean, is it time for the pricing model to change or to evolve? Just want to get your thoughts there.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We think we should get paid more for doing more. And I think â yes, I think, we are. It's not something, but we don't charge jump fees. I think we do get paid for the services that we provide. The idea of margin compression, I haven't been hearing a lot about that lately. I think the margins in this business are higher than they've been in a very long time, thanks to our competition in some respects. So, we think we're getting paid for it. When we hit, our operating margins are improving and they're going to improve and our revenues are certainly growing up pretty rapidly. So, I'm not sure that we have a problem with that.
Robert H. B. Baldwin - Vice Chairman
But keeping in mind that the RM out there in the field is the one who is setting the pricing within the constraints that we establish, and so the reason a pricing group work that we put out in front of them, and as a result, of course we're not going to be going out there and saying, okay now it's going to be blank percent higher or anything. But they are selling value and we think that the values that we're offering and now with the Heartland Secure and the out-of-scope, that opportunity is better than ever.
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
At the risk of little bit of inside baseball, we have this Exhibit E philosophy where we take the operating costs out of the revenue to get margin, and we pay based on margin, and the fact of the matter is our Exhibit E costs have gone up, as we've built out EMV and our IT capability Heartland Secure, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and those costs have to absorbed as additional operating cost of the business, and from time-to-time we review Exhibit E, and we are going to be increasing the Exhibit E cost on the first of the year, which we've already worked that out. So, we are, so the gap between revenue and margin is going to go up a little bit, starting in with 2016 sales as a result of that, and that's Heartland's way of dealing with the issue that you are bringing up.
Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right, thank you very much for that.

The next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, very helpful commentary on the sales strategy. Just to take off on that, if I could, you continue to grow the sales head count at very, very rapid rates. Can you maybe remind us of your goals here in terms of head count growth into 2016 and also productivity growth into 2016? And then maybe touch a little bit on besides the change with the SPAs, what other management changes have you made to drive increased productivity?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the number one change that had impact other than the â is the payroll SPA model as well as adding division managers from outside the company. I think those two things have been the most significant. Our goal for head count is to continue to have high productivity per sales rep. I think we're over $8,500 of margin per month now, which is I can't believe we're there. We were $2,500 a few years ago, we're $8,500 now per rep.
So we are going to be able, and I think the reason we're so excited about the future is that hitting this $10 million mark proves that our model is really scalable. And as we go into these time-and-attendance and employee scheduling, labor management, and all the other things that we can do, services we can provide through the POS, through the cloud, it's going to take more and more salespeople selling more and more products.
So I think we're going to get to a 2,000 person sales organization again. We had that at one time, as we know. It wasn't very productive. We know how to make it productive now. And so I think that 1,400 number will go to a couple thousand over the next couple of years. And if we continue to be able to offer more and more products through our mini-ERP system called the POS, I think the future is â we have a long runway ahead of us.
James Schneider - Goldman Sachs
That's helpful, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, just could you give us a bit of an update on the XPIENT, Dinerware acquisitions, and particularly whether you've had any success you could call out in terms of conversions of any large QSR or other merchants onto your processing platform from the point-of-sale side?
Robert H. B. Baldwin - Vice Chairman
We have had a couple of nice wins, but we can't really talk about that on this call. That's confidential information, proprietary information. We have focused on moving â frankly, we focus a heck of a lot on our EMV and out-of-scope solutions for Dinerware and XPIENT and pcAmerica, put a lot of energy in there, and also just integrating them into Heartland. And I feel like we've been successful with it. We haven't set any of the world on fire, but we've made some good progress. We're building for the long term here. We're not trying to get quick wins so much as we're trying to build a solid, sustainable model going forward, and I know we're doing that.

The next question comes from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great, thanks for letting me ask my questions. In terms of I guess just the guidance, if you just look at the card processing line, I know last year you guys had two quarters of benefit on the OptBlue program. I'm just wondering. Are there any other additional benefits of OptBlue? What inning are we in, in that program? And then anything to call out in terms of how we should model that line for the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So what happened last year, as you mentioned, Steven, we had two quarters worth of revenue related to OptBlue happen in the in the fourth quarter of last year. Naturally, this year we are only going to have what should be a profit for the fourth quarter. So just comparing one quarter over another, it would look like that revenue from OptBlue has declined. But since of course throughout the year we have been signing customers on the OptBlue program only. So we're not only talking about the conversion that happened from last year, but we continue to add customers and convert existing customers as well to begin to accept AmEx.
So from a modeling point of view, compared to last year, there is already organic growth in the AmEx program, but the one area that you would have to focus on is what's happened last year, which was the double revenue related to the conversion.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And in terms of the OptBlue program, what innings are you guys in, in terms of converting your existing clients?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
We have converted all of the clients that need to be converted within the phases that we have. So there is four phases of OptBlue. Within the three phases, we are really deep into it. All of the Phase 3, which is converting existing customers that already accepted AmEx, that has been completed. There's a Phase 4 for AmEx, and that is not in our guidance. And that's still going to be in front of us. And that is converting customers that are typically larger, that the volume of which is still accounted for AmEx, not for us.
Steven Kwok - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it, great. Thanks for taking my questions.

Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks, guys, nice job. I just want to start off. If you can, give us some color on your expectations around same-store sales growth given the strength we saw this quarter and just recognizing where lapping gas savings as well?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, I think you might have heard me before say that it's very hard to predict that the 4% would be sustainable. We always predict between 2% and 3%. But so far every quarter that we've done, we have had better than that. So for the rest of this year â so throughout the year, we've moved up from that 2% to 3% more closer to the 3%. And right now for the rest of this year, we're assuming between 3% and 4%.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful, Samir. Thanks. And then just to follow up on the strength we're seeing in the Campus business, may just give a little more color on the progress and what's happening over the last quarter or two on TouchNet, or the synergy related to TouchNet cross-selling, and maybe any progress on Canada as well from that on that front?
Robert O. Carr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
TouchNet is distracted by the Royals being in the World Series. I'll say that.
Robert H. B. Baldwin - Vice Chairman
But TouchNet, what a great acquisition that was for us, great people, and it's worked out really well. TouchNet has been signing new universities to their platform. The good news is that many of the new signings are Heartland Payments customers along with it. The bad news is it's difficult to get schools to move. If there are â from their incumbent processor if they're already with us. It's a long haul, long road, long slog, but we knew that going in and it's proven to be true.
We've had more success though than we expected in bringing on new payments customers with the new schools coming on and the number of new schools coming on has been robust.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Clearly, I would...
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Go ahead, Samir.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Sorry, I was going to â I would also add that ECSI and the Campus cards have also benefited from selling their products into the TouchNet's customers. So the cross-sell opportunity that we started to see in Q2 continue to exist in the next couple of...
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Right.
Unknown Speaker
And we do expect them to.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
That's what I was getting at. So, how â where are we in that process now, and I know it's still kind of early, but it seems like the opportunity was a big one?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Absolutely. And that's certainly, I mean, this was one of the pieces upon which we built that. The strategy for the acquisition, as Bob mentioned, that has been a fantastic acquisition. It's still early on where â these are schools at different sizes, and we will not be converting them into â the tenth of them on a monthly basis. But, we're starting to create traction there. And I believe success like this will start driving more and more success. So we're still early on, as we mentioned there, about that sounds very promising.
Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. I will leave you there. There's other questions I'll ask offline. Thanks, guys.

The next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter again. Two questions. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the kind of the other puts and takes, as we look into 4Q, because it looks like the guide you guys gave sort of implies the below street on revenue and EPS. Is it mostly the OptBlue double counting that we're seeing there or are other revenue in cost items that we should think about? And then, I have one follow up.
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So it is only the OptBlue. There isn't anything else that would cause the revenue to be below where the street is. I think the street may need to update same-store sales. So I can't really comment a lot on where the street is, but the only difference Q4 this year versus last year was only OptBlue.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then, the second question is, this is a bigger picture one. It seems like the gross margin installed, and the traction you all are getting with this, the conversations from the EMV shift, which is a big deal for merchants, you're getting a lot more traction on that, than as I recall that you guys did when Durbin happened, which seems like the last big shift that happened for merchants. Am I remembering that right, and if so, what is the â what's helping you get the traction this time better than last time?
Robert H. B. Baldwin - Vice Chairman
Brett, I wouldn't say that Durbin represented at all the same kind of shift at the merchant level, I mean, it was we pass through the reduction in price, and as that became evident out in the marketplace or people did well. So we had a good process and good sales then. I think we have â today it's a more palpable or more visible thing that the merchant is facing, and it's also in the context of course is the greater security issues. So between those I think, it's a more robust and more obvious opportunity for the sales person to take advantage of. And we have a much bigger and stronger sales force to advantage of it.
Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.
Great, that's helpful. Thank you.

The next question comes from the Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Please go ahead.
Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC
Hi, guys. Good job. Nice quarter. I was really surprised as well by the strength in new margin install and that really bodes well for trends going into next year. I was more curious on the ancillary businesses. Is there any reason why an organic basis is the aggregate or your ancillary businesses that the growth rate there would not be in line with your card payment processing in 2016?
Samir Michael Zabaneh - Chief Financial Officer
No. I mean, so we would have to look at each of these businesses on a standalone basis, each of payroll, School Solutions and campuses, there is no reason why the growth in each one of them will not be the same as what we have seen this year. Of course, School Solutions this quarter had a little bit of just anomaly, but otherwise, we do expect that division to continue to grow just like it has been in the past.
With respect to the Heartland Commerce, we've started to see really good sequential growth. The addition of Digital Dining that will definitely help and that company is growing. So, next year, that growth is going to continue, just in line with adding customers and certainly adding payments revenue and payroll revenue into that division, that will accelerate the growth of that division. As Bob mentioned, we were in the early stages of adding payment and payroll to them, but we do expect that to continue.
So, overall, if you look at them on a standalone, each one of them, we will still be in the double-digit growth.
