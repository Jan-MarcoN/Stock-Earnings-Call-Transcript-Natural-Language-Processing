Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Heartland Payment Systems Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Yearend 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
Now I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Zabaneh, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Emily, and good morning, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal yearend 2014 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Bob Carr, our Chairman and CEO; and Bob Baldwin, our Vice Chairman.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of our discussions may contain statements of a forward-looking nature, which represent management's belief and assumptions concerning future events. Looking forward statements involve risks, uncertainty and assumptions that are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors. Information concerning these factors is contained in the report of our financial results we released earlier this morning and that accompany our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements made during this call to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after this call.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Bob Carr.
Bob Carr
Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in Heartland.
There is lots to talk about today. So I am going to leave the financial discussion to Samir and get right into the highlights for the quarter and some of the developments that we recently announced. We had another terrific quarter with outstanding growth in card processing volume, card net revenues and total net revenues.
It was also our ninth consecutive quarter of new business growth with another quarter of record new margin installed.
Our non-card businesses also had another great quarter with strong organic revenue growth as well as contributions from our recent TouchNet and Xpient acquisitions.
Card performance was a standout once again this quarter, with fourth quarter processing volume up double-digits. The rate of volume growth accelerated sequentially every year -- every quarter this year. This is driving a comparable acceleration in the rate of card net revenue growth.
The increase in processing volumes and net revenues demonstrates how the success of our new business initiatives are leading the business forward and with record new business for both the quartet and the year, we are heading into 2015 with strong momentum.
We couldnât have asked for a more ideal backdrop against which to announce our new strategic acquisitions in the point of sale market. pcAmerica and Dinerware had 55,000 new locations that will further scale our existing cloud based point of sale solutions and provide a solid platform to support our aggressive growth initiatives.
Combined with our acquisition of Liquor POS and our acquisition of Xpient in 2014, we've now added 90,000 new merchant locations to our portfolio in the past 12 months, but our strategy is not to simply follow the competition into the POS market, but to essentially leapfrog current ISV distribution models with more robust solutions that are at the forefront of the industry.
Our goal is to enhance the benefits of integration with a wealth of valuable additional functionality and flexibility that help both dealers and merchants improve their efficiency and productivity, most importantly, because we're one of the few companies that owns the additional complementary services they can deliver to their clients for instance payroll.
We offer an unparallel ability to help dealers improve and sustain their profits. We enjoy a number of competitive advantages in our core processing market that can be easily translated to the POS world.
From the industry's best security solutions to product innovation and from our merchant relationships to our highly efficient distribution network, we have the resources to significantly improve upon current integrated solution approaches. Our goal is to provide a solution that benefits everyone in the value chain including dealers, but especially small and midsized merchants.
Similar to what we did years ago with interchange plus pricing, we plan to bring the functionality and features that are currently only available to large merchants down to main street America. Our robust integrated solutions will include services such as payroll services, employee scheduling, labor cost controls, online ordering, reservations, wait list management and other valuable services, all working together to save time and increase profits.
Our strategic strategy is one that we believe will significantly improve current POS technology. It's widely acknowledged that hackers have exploited the security weaknesses of many integrated systems to gain access to card information through the POS system. We've greatly reduced this vulnerability with encryption and out of scope technology, where card information is never exposed during POS processing.
We will be rolling out our unique out of scope solution to not only our POS merchants, but we will also be introducing it to all of our payments merchants as well as competing ISVs, developers and payment companies. We also intend for all of our cloud based locations to have their own local site controller offering the redundancy of offline processing for payments and other critical functions that is missing from many competing products.
And with Heartland Secure available to protect card processing, we offer a powerful solution that takes integrated POS security to a whole new level. By virtue of our POS acquisitions, we've gained several dealer networks, augmenting the significant success we achieved in signing over 175 dealers to our trusted dealer network in 2014 and nicely complementing our existing direct sales organization.
We're excited because we believe these independent business owners can be a valuable contributor to our success and we to their. We can offer these dealers not only the most competitive POS solutions in the market, but also a set of financial incentives that only Heartland dealers will be able to enjoy.
For the first time, Heartland is no longer a single channel distribution company. We are positioned to be more effective in the competitive arena than ever before.
From a product standpoint, dealers will be able to offer merchants an open architecture, highly secure integrated POS solution with a number of additional applications readily available, including payroll and for the hospitality industry reservations and table management among others.
This wealth of additional applications will not only strengthen their customer relationships, but will enable dealers to take a bigger bite out of the margin stack, building their residual income with sticky multi product services. Overall, we believe this represents an attractive package that will increasingly dealer preferences in our direction.
Looking a little bit closer at the two recent acquisitions both Dinerware and pcAmerica, are leaders in the restaurant industry, while pcAmerica also adds 20,000 additional retail locations beyond the restaurants. They're highly successful and combined have approximately 55 locations using their state of the art POS technology.
As a result of these two acquisitions, 121,000 restaurant locations now use Heartland for either their POS or payment solution or integrate or in a growing number of cases both.
Heartland now serves 15.1% of the entire restaurant market and 20% of the table service restaurant market, well 19.7% if you want to be more precise.
We are in the process of consolidating all of our POS technologies, including Xpient and Liquor POS under the evolving Heartland commerce umbrella. As presently constituted, Heartland Commerce would have over 90,000 POS locations and $30 million in annual revenue, primarily in the hospitality industry.
With a decision to utilize off the shelf hardware, there is no longer a need to develop purpose built hardware or related operating systems and payment software. Therefore, Leaf's direction will be changed and Leaf will become the focal point of our POS cloud based development efforts and as such a key to expanding our technology beyond restaurant and retail and into additional industries.
Therefore we're keeping the core development teams and focusing them on cloud based infrastructure, web services and API development. Heartland Commerce represents a natural and logical extension of our basic payments business into a market we think offers outstanding growth potential.
As another leg of the Heartland, still we believe Heartland Commerce represents an opportunity to leverage our core strengths to grow in an adjacent market where we bring a wealth of knowledge and experience.
For an industry that still faces significant security, integration and other challenges, we're offering solutions that effectively meet basic needs and provide the strongest protection available with added functionality that can help merchants improve their performance of their businesses.
With that, let me turn it over to Samir to discuss the financial results for the quarter.
Samir Zabaneh
Thank you, Bob.
Let me turn our attention back to the results for the quarter and begin with a quick review of the impairment charges we reported this morning.
As Bob mentioned, the acquisition of Dinerware and pcAmerica solidified our presence in the POS market and strengthened Heartland's scope and scale of cloud POS products.
As such related development efforts at Leaf would be redundant and hence we determined it was best to hold these efforts, necessitating the recognition of impairment charges related to the investments we had already made at Lead and in prosper our internal POS software technology.
Separately, during the fourth quarter we determined that our investment in TabbedOut was impaired. The total value of that pretax asset impairment charges was $41.4 million of which $37.4 million was included in the calculation of operating income and the remaining $4 million related to TabbedOut was recorded below the operating income line.
The after-tax impact of the entire write down was $37.6 million or $1.02 per share and is included in our GAAP and adjusted EPS. Taking these various charges into account for the fourth quarter we reported a net loss on a GAAP basis of $19.8 million or $0.55 per share and an adjusted net loss of $15.2 million or $0.42 per share.
Adjusted results reflect $0.09 of acquisition-related amortizations and $0.04 of share-based compensation. Normalizing for the write down, adjusted EPS would have been $0.60 per share.
Now from an operating perspective, Heartland delivered another solid quarter. Net revenue increased by 26.2%, a quarterly record of $188.3 million, totaled by strong organic growth, especially in card processing, as well contributions from our positions.
Card processing net revenue increased by 16.6% during the quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by solid volume growth as well as the catch up of outflow revenue billed in the third quarter as we mentioned in our previous earnings call.
Let me spend a minute on the SME processing volume increase. Overall, our volume increased by 14.6% including OptBlue, excluding which volume was up 10.1%, which was an exceptional performance and represented the fourth quarter of sequential improvement that began at the beginning of 2014.
Starting with the first quarter, SME volume increased by 3.5% followed by 5.4% and 7.1% in the second and third quarters respectively. The 10.1% is a continuation of the solid organic growth and benefitted from an over two year run of quarter after quarter record new margin installed.
Installed margin rose nearly 12% to a record $21.4 million in the fourth quarter capping off a year in which new margin installed grew over 17% to a record $83.4 million. Finally, card processing benefitted from an improved from an improved economic backdrop with fourth quarter same store sales of 3.9% and net volume attrition of 10.7%, the best quarterly performance this year.
Growth of our non-card revenue also accelerated in the quarter, increasing by $21 million or 53% from the same period a year ago and accounting for approximately 32% of net revenue for the quarter. In addition to organic growth, non-card revenue reflects a full quarter of TouchNet and partial quarter of Xpient.
Processing and servicing cost were up 35% in the quarter. Almost 25% of the cost increase was attributable to the inclusion of TouchNet and Xpient, while 22% was due to a $4.6 million or about $0.07 per share loss on charge backs from a single merchant that declared bankruptcy in the fourth quarter.
Merchant losses of this magnitude are extremely rare, but they do occur from time to time. Excluding losses related to this merchant, overall merchant losses for the quarter would have been in line with recent experience notwithstanding an overall increase in the number of merchants and processing volume.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.2 million or 71% when approximately two thirds of the increase related to 2014 acquisitions. It is important to highlight that as of the fourth quarter, total depreciation and acquisition amortization was running at approximately $10 million per quarter.
We expect DNA to increase in 2015 due to the acquisitions and other development efforts we expect to conduct during the year.
General and administrative expenses were up $11 million or 26% for the quarter with our 60% of the increase attributable to the addition of TouchNet and Xpient and the remainder related to the organic growth of the business.
The GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $4.6 million, while on an adjusted basis we reported operating income of $2.9 million. These figures include the impairment charges recorded during the quarter as well as operating losses related to Leaf, normalizing for which GAAP operating income and adjusted operating income would have been $35 million and $42.2 million respectively with corresponding margins of 18.6% and 22.4% respectively.
Cash flow remains strong in the fourth quarter with management's measure of operating cash flow totaling $39.5 million compared to $32.7 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the year were $54.9 million, in line with our expectation.
We expect 2015 capital expenditures to be in line with the 2014 level. Free cash flow will be used to reduce our outstanding dept as well as to continue to reward shareholders through the payment of dividends and potentially share repurchases within the parameters allowed in our credit agreement.
Let me give you my perspective on our overall performance for the year. Heartland had an exceptional year, not only in delivering solid financial performance in our core business, but also setting up drivers and platforms for further accelerations in 2015 and beyond.
Our net revenue for the year was $673 million, an increase of over 12% compared to past year with organic growth of 8% driven mainly by our core card processing business. Each of payroll Heartland School Solutions and capital solutions delivered double-digit growth as anticipated.
From an EPS perspective, our GAAP and adjusted EPS were $0.91 and $1.35 respectively. However, normalizing for the assets write down as well as unusual merchant loss described earlier. Our GAAP and adjusted EPS would be $1.90 and $2.34 respectively. All of these figures include $0.17 of operational losses related to Leaf.
Now to wrap up with our guidance, for the year 2015, we expect net revenue to grow 15% to 17% and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85. This guidance anticipates that Dinerware and pcAmerica contribute approximately $12 million to revenue and are marginally accretive to adjusted EPS.
As we indicated previously, TouchNet is expected to add a minimum of $60 million of revenue and $0.30 of earnings to full year results. Guidance assumes that after tax share based compensation and acquisition related amortization expenses reduce earnings per share by $0.06 to $0.08 for the year and an effective tax rate of 39%.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Bob for a few concluding remarks.
Bob Carr
Thank you, Samir.
After closing today's call and opening it up for questions, I am pleased to, I should say before doing that, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors as ordered to increase the quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.10 per share. This new higher dividend will be payable March 13 to shareholders of record on March 2, 2015.
And finally as always, I would like to thank all of the great Heartland team members for making these very powerful results so positive.
Emily, we're now ready to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Weâll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Tim Willi
Thank you and good morning Bob and Samir. Two questions just going back around the acquisitions and then try to clarify something on guidance if I could, so if we think about the new strategy with the acquisitions that you announced today and some earlier in the year around the POS system.
And then what weâve sort of gone through with Leaf, which I remember correctly when you announced that investment and then stepped up the ownership over the last, like five to seven quarters, that was something weâre extremely excited about at least I have the impression that was a key moment and sort of something we're pivotal of the Heartland on a go forward basis.
And now it looks like certain aspects of that is true, but other aspects have backed off. So could you may be if I follow-up, just talk about where the confidence comes from with these new acquisitions relative to what weâd heard and how you talked about Leaf specifically over the last year and half to give people some level of confidence that a year or two years from now, there is not another pivot on strategy or a write down or are we focusing and I think that would be something people probably would like to better understand given the announcements today and then I had a quick follow up on the guidance.
Bob Carr
Thanks Tim. I think that question is entirely fair and appropriate. We are excited about the cost based point of sale business. The number one differentiator in the Leaf approach and weâve learned this from being involved so much with Leaf is that we now have 90,000 new customers.
Leaf was struggling to get into the thousands like many of the other Tablet companies and by being involved with Leaf making that investment, we picked up tremendous number of great developers that we are keeping, to help build out the web services and cloud based platform that was the heart of what we were looking at for Leaf.
But now we have two companies, three companies actually by counting Xpient, that our market leading developers all working in the same arena what they bring to us all these new customers. So this makes us overnight basically an open payment platform.
We're going to be processing transactions for all of our competitors because the cost of these 90,000 new customers, many of them are with Heartland, but many of them are not and weâre going to continue processing for them.
So we have this huge base of customers. Hardly any of these customers are using payroll or time scheduling or labor cost controls and so on tied to the POS. We bring that -- all that functionality to these 90,000 new customers versus the small number of customers that Leaf had been able to develop.
We were building it. It was coming along fine, but this sort of leapfrogged us and kept us from having to develop 90,000 customers on our own organically.
Now we have those 90,000 customers. We have all the great Leaf talent still available to us plus the really great talent that we get from these three companies and weâre going to be able to merge that together and be in market very quickly.
Itâs going to help our out of scope solution which is going to be an industry changing solution because it comes will all the with all the transaction fee license to take out of scope.
So we just think, now we have our base of payment customers plus these 90,000 new ones and its very exciting to think that we can have a real business to build up instead of creating it. We know how to create a new business. Weâve done it over and over again, but I think we learned a lot from our School Solutions business.
We acquired a couple of those companies and then we would with Michael Lawlerâs leadership acquiring half a dozen those customers and we have 35% of that market. It's worked very, very well for us and thatâs what we think is possible in the POS marketplace as well.
We have four POS companies. We're the dominant player in the liquor industry. We have a great market share in the restaurant business and we have a proven ability to distribute us our payroll and payment services and our other services throughout the marketplace.
Another part of that is we now have this additional distribution channel. We were building a distribution channel with Leaf and it was coming on fairly well but itâs a whole different animal when we have these 90,000 customers most of whom came through dealers.
The dealers many of them have been converted overall, ready to Heartland under what we call our Trusted Dealer Program. So now today, we have an additional channel of distribution that we never had before and this channel we have the additional margin thatâs available to the distributors and the distributors we worked out a way.
We learned overall these years now how to work with a dealer, how they can add their value and how our sales person can add the value. And finally I want to mention SmartLink. SmartLink needs a local technically competent service organization, which Heartlands has never been able to provide before.
With our dealers, theyâre going to be able to go in an install our SmartLink product and be able to service it very, very confidently. So those are all big differences. Itâs a long answer, but itâs an important question.
Tim Willi
Yeah and very much appreciate the color there. So the last -- the other follow-up I had just on the guidance, so the adjusted EPS of $2.34 that you had quoted, Samir in a later dialogue which excluded the big charge and then the extraordinary loss, embedded in that was $0.17 from Leaf with the changes that you had with Leaf and the direction that Bob just talked about.
At $0.17, how would that, is that essentially now eliminated or were there still I guess, if you try to apples-to-apples the Leaf impact, is there still going to be some dilution in '15 or is it essentially just written down and not a drag on the results.
Samir Zabaneh
Thatâs a good question Tim. So the $0.17 will not be entirely eliminated, Leafâs team will become part of Heartland Commerce. There is an increased cost so it will not be zero, but there is $3 million to $5 million that would be cost that we would keep from the Leaf side that would stay part of the Heartland Commerce.
We will not be talking about Leaf and the drive from Leaf. But there is an overall cost for the business as part of continuing to build Heartland Commerce and getting further into the cloud.
Bob Carr
And one thing Iâd like to just add and this is really a major theme here and it's going to be for 2015. The development of EMV an out of scope is a very costly expense and it can't really be capitalized very well because we have the train running down the tracks.
So weâre going to be impaired in 2015 by spending a heck of lot of money getting EMV out and install especially now that we have these different platforms that weâll be sending transactions to. So we have to make a heavy investment and thatâs obviously taking into account in our guidance for 2015.
Tim Willi
Okay, great. Iâll hop back in the queue. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question is from Dave Koning of Baird. Please go ahead.
Dave Koning
Yeah, good morning guys. I guess a couple things, first of all just making sure on guidance again, how big are the new acquisitions pcAmerica and the other one and when do they start?
Samir Zabaneh
We bought -- we bought them in -- we bought pcAmerica by the end of January and two days ago we closed the deal with Dinerware.
Dave Koning
And how much revenue do they contribute?
Samir Zabaneh
We said in 2015, we expect to have revenue of $12 million combined.
Dave Koning
$12 million combined, okay and then what does that imply I guess for organic? I know there is TouchNet is in there and there is I think just a little bit of MCS but what does that imply for organic growth for 2015?
Samir Zabaneh
So on top of the $12 million, we said TouchNet will be a minimum of $60 million of revenue, Xpient will be -- Xpient and as well as pcAmerica and Dinerware will be part of Heartland Commerce. As Bob mentioned, they will be around $30 million and the rest of the revenue and the guidance will be coming from organic growth.
So really, Dave, you got to think about TouchNet, Heartland Commerce and the rest would be organic growth.
Dave Koning
Got you. Okay, okay and then it looked like the school business it looked like that was down organically in Q4 and Iâm just wondering it was $15 million I guess it was up $1 million year-over-year. But it included the MCS contribution. So I think on an organic basis it was down maybe you can just talk about the trends there?
Samir Zabaneh
So, during the fourth quarter of 2013, we part of the installation for a big school board there was lot of equipment sale. And those equipment sales do not come on a recurring basis. The recurring revenue of Heartland School solution is solid and it continues to grow.
But when we do a major installation similar to the one we did last year you would see that equipment revenue not necessarily repeat itself. But the fundamentals are still exceptionally solid.
Dave Koning
Got you, great and then one final just quick one OptBlue I know you got kind of double benefit in Q4. How much kind of incremental that you kind of took from Q3 fell in Q4 that wonât recur?
Samir Zabaneh
So the Q3 revenue that we recorded in Q4 was around $4 million.
Dave Koning
Around $4 million. Okay, great job on the core results too thatâs great to see.
Samir Zabaneh
Excellent. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Condra of BMO. Please go ahead.
Paul Condra
Hey guys thanks for taking the call. I wanted to ask a little bit about the new customer base, now you have these acquisitions. And when you think about EMV penetration across those merchants, where does that sit now and is that kind of immediate opportunity for you?
Bob Carr
Yeah, itâs not really an immediate opportunity, because the technology is being developed, and the merchants are really reluctant to invest in additional hardware for EMV itâs going to be a trench warfare for a while until we get into October and there is examples of merchants who are having to pay large penalties or have problems, because theyâre not EMV compliant.
Our strategy is to offer a lot more functionality to these 90,000 customers and give them incentives to go to EMV as part of the upgrade of their systems and we think thatâs going to be really helpful, but for the next quarter or two, weâre not going to see a lot of that being installed.
We also have many ISV connectivity that we have to maintain in addition to the ones that we own. So the EMV play a major, major role towards the end of '15 I think and end of '16. Itâs going to be a big driver of our business both expense wise and revenue wise.
Bob Baldwin
If I could just add, I was at a Visa meeting of all the major acquirers just yesterday addressing this exact issue in particular the challenges of getting adoption and really offering solutions to the POS marketplace, because of the delays of the debit AID and then many certification challenges that are out there.
This is a really major undertaking for the whole ecosystem. And in doing that what weâre looking to do, weâre very focused and I think the industry is moving in the direction of both out of scope and much heavier reliant on encryption, where Heartland is I think well recognized as the leading or one of the leading player.
So, itâs going to be hard, itâs a major change in the entire ecosystem for consumers, for merchants, and for the processing community, but we think that, that we go into that with some tremendous assets behind us.
Paul Condra
Okay, great and just following up on that, when you kind of look past liability shifts now you have a lot of these merchants that are compliant. What does that imply for you in terms of any kind of increased credit risk exposure or any kind of liability for this as a liability shift I guess takes place?
Bob Carr
Thereâs important -- couple of important points, the different MCCs are going to have different levels of exposure. Restaurants for example you canât expense lunch, so the amount of card throw out at a restaurant is pretty trivial. If you are a electronics dealer you better figure out how to enable EMV very, very quickly.
And so we buying MCC, the exposure is going to be incremental. Itâs not something that hits you all at once. The merchant will have a fraud loss that theyâll eat, that they didn't previously eat that will encourage them to move to EMV but in terms of the dollar cost in any one period is going to be pretty low.
What we absorbed is when the merchant goes out of business and has not paid for that loss. So itâs really one month's worth of exposure. So when you cut it down, itâs definitely elevated in certain MCCs, where merchant tend to rather where the bad guys tend to use kind of their cards. But itâs because of the way that its spread over a long period of time the impact is going to be very manageable I think.
Paul Condra
Okay, thanks for that detail. One more of this, if you can give us maybe some trend guidance across your business lines so for just campus solutions, score solution, payroll in 2015 what's the expectation?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure these businesses will continue to grow under double-digit area just like they did in 2014. We talked about the cards business and we expect to continue to accelerate. Weâve shown four quarters sequentially of continue to increase and we expect to continue to perform at that level.
So overall if you look across the business all of the business lines that we have, theyâre all performing exceptionally well and we expect them to be like that in 2015.
Paul Condra
Thanks.
Samir Zabaneh
Sure.
Operator
Our next question is from George Mihalos of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
George Mihalos
Great. Thanks for taking my question and nice to see the momentum in the business. I wanted to start off on the strategy side. The new dealer strategy, just curious how many dealers are you currently partnered with today? Where are you looking to get that too within a reasonable timeframe say 2015?
And then how do you feel about that distribution channel versus your traditional feet on the street?
Bob Carr
Yeah thatâs a great question. We have about 250 dealers right now. With these acquisitions, if you count dealers who resell the products, weâre in over a 1,000 dealers. But itâs like the sales organization. We used to have 80% of our sales coming from 20% of our sales people now itâs more -- much more even throughout the organization.
Itâs more like 80 to 55 something like that, but with the dealers, thatâs 80/20 or 90/10 frankly. So the number of dealers is important as the amount of business thatâs done by the dealer and we're going to work on that very, very hard.
Over the years we worked out ways to work with the dealers that want to work with us. And weâve figured out how to blend our sales organization in with the dealers. The dealers definitely bring things to the table that have gotten better over time such as their ability to do the service and taking the first line service calls also doing the installation of the products.
So we've worked out in our compensation model to pay the dealers for their work that they're doing and then if they bring an account to us for payroll or payments or other recurring services, then weâre able to pay them a finder's fee for that as well.
So, the marketplace has taught us a lot of lessons. I plead guilty on not being open minded about some of this years ago. But I think weâve adjusted to the realities and are now setting the trend frankly. So weâre very excited about the dealer program.
Weâve been meeting with many other dealers and they're entrepreneurial business people just like we are and we have a lot of things to offer them. They have a lot of things to offer us and I think our sales organization is thrilled to have them. Sales organization has so many products now to sell, compared to where we were just five or six years ago.
That their hands are full with all of our services, and working with the dealers is a very nice complemental relationship at this point.
George Mihalos
Okay, I appreciate the color there. And then as it relates to the SME volumes, which are accelerating I think they accelerated throughout all of 4Q? I think you started October at 9% and your number suggest it was elevated from there. Anything you can highlight so far through January?
Samir Zabaneh
Sure, so January so far is going to have or has the same trends that we had in the fourth quarter in terms of same-store sales in terms of new margin installed. So the volume growth will continue to be in line with what we've seen for the whole quarter.
George Mihalos
Okay, great. And just last question from me the merchant loss of $0.07 hit. What sector was that merchant in exactly? Thank you.
Bob Carr
It was a big chain of it was a laserâ¦
Samir Zabaneh
Laser hair removeâ¦
Bob Carr
â¦chain, which just shut its stores one day and of course youâd buy those things, those treatments in packages and consumers have the right to charge that back even if they're through all but one of their treatments. So itâs actually a good relationship for a long time. And one day they just didnât open the doors.
George Mihalos
Okay. Thank you.
Bob Carr
I just also like to call attention to last Januaryâs weather. So last January was really a tough month. So we did have a great January, compared to last year. But last year was a pretty bad year too in terms of the weather. So just want to make sure everybody remembers that.
Operator
Our next question is from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Smittipon Srethapramote
Yes. Thank you. Same-store sales growth at 3.9% was quite strong in the past quarter. Can you talk about how much of that strength may have come from lower gas prices? I think Visa mentioned on their call a couple of weeks ago that one particular beneficiary the lower gas prices so they've seen is the QSR category and that seems to have shown up in your numbers with QSRs up 11% and restaurants up of 5%?
Samir Zabaneh
So same-store sales this is on the SME side and if there is an impact coming from lower gas prices then you're referring to increased discretional income from people then one would assume that there is an impact. But I would say, there is not a clear link between the lower gas prices and the same-store sales.
We believe that the overall economy is moving in the right direction and that general trend especially with the spending, but theyâre spending around main street, which is where our -- the concentration of our customers seems to have increased.
Bob Carr
And I did hear an industry event that the typical family is saving about $60 a year right now based upon the reduced gas prices and then about a quarter of that is going into the additional spending and a lot of it is going into paying down debt and into savings.
So weâre looking at $15 a quarter I donât mean a year $60 a quarter. So I think thatâs an interesting statistics.
Smittipon Srethapramote
I think Visa mentioned was $60 a month, but -- and then maybe just follow-up question. You talk about aiming to provide a complete suite of solution to small business. Are there any services that youâre still missing to a client for example on a payroll space?
We understand there are a lot of companies are signing up for PEOs instead of just for the typical payroll product? Is that something that you potentially would explore in the coming future?
Bob Carr
Thatâs not on our roadmap at this point. There's PEOs of course are very active right now and thatâs one strategy for a business to undertake. It's got pluses or minuses like everything else. We have -- there are lots of opportunities in the core payroll business letâs say in terms of products adding what we continue to do in our payroll business is to add it more broadly in the HRIS capabilities.
And so have a broader and deeper set of solutions to offer to the payroll merchants, but PEO is a very -- it has very structural differences not to say itâs good or bad, itâs just different and we have not so far contemplated that.
Smittipon Srethapramote
Okay. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Ramsey El-Assal
Hey guys I wanted to ask you about the Heartland Commerce initiative, you mentioned $30 million in annual revenue, can you talk a bit about your expectations for the kind of revenue run rate of that business as well as maybe how market in that business compared to your overall company averages?
Samir Zabaneh
So from -- we said that the current run rate is around $30 million and in terms of guidance for where the revenue is going to be, weâll give you some more color as time pass by.
That business, the whole segment is being built right now. There is going to be a lot of cross-selling opportunities between cards and payroll and emersions we do have that in that segment. Weâre very excited about it and we think that the potential revenue that we will get from that segment is substantially bigger than the $30 million weâre talking about today.
So you should expect an increase coming up from the $30 million and weâll give you more color on that as we continue the segment.
Ramsey El-Assal
So the growth rate in that segment you donât have a clear read on whether it will be higher than lower and then company averages at this point?
Samir Zabaneh
It will be higher than the company average. So it will be accretive to our overall growth rate.
Ramsey El-Assal
Okay, and margins as well?
Samir Zabaneh
Margins right now they are -- these were smaller companies and the margins right now I would put them in line with Heartlandâs overall operating margins as we consolidate these businesses and we begin to cross-sell some other products and then the margins will expand, but for today I would assume the margins are in line with Heartlandâs operating margin, they will grow.

Our next question is from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
James Schneider
Good morning, thanks for taking my question, I was wondering if you could just maybe comment on the relationship manager spend, I think it was down slightly by pretty much immaterial amount in Q4, but after some really strong quarters of growth, can you maybe comment on the trend of that during 2015 do you expect to spend that a lot more aggressively or pretty much flat line from here?
Bob Carr
No we expect it to grow -- our productivity continues to grow and our installation margin has grown nicely and continues to grow nicely. The headcount was impaired a little bit last quarter by our recruiting of Heartland payroll special product advisors, but we expect that to return the growth to return in this year.
Bob Baldwin
The underlying recruiting trends remain good and I think it makes a little harder is just going to be the attrition that you get -- commission only sales has always been a tough challenging business and weâre going to get times when people decide to move on. But overall we do look to continue growth in the sales organization in 2015 and beyond.
James Schneider
Thatâs helpful. Thanks. And then when we go forward in 2015 clearly youâre seeing a benefit from the AmEx's OptBlue program, which you call lucky out before and also presumably some benefit from the price increases put through by Visa and Master Card. 
Can you maybe just quantify the impact of those two effects in 2015 guidance or what it was at least in fourth quarter of 2014 roughly?
Samir Zabaneh
Weâre not going to separate the guidance by the card program. As I mentioned earlier, we had the benefit that we booked in Q4 of $4 million related to OptBlue. The fourth quarter would be the same. So you would assume and that started at the beginning of July.
So you would assume that there is -- the annualized portion of the OptBlue revenue that is coming from that.
Bob Carr
And then the other thing is just we donât -- changes in pricing by Visa and Master Card are just pass through and donât show up at all in our net revenue. So happens to be no impact from that.
James Schneider
Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead,
Andrew Jeffrey
Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I would just like to dig down a little bit on Heartland Commerce and the strategy and how it ultimately accretes to Heartland?
On one hand itâs clear that you are kind of differentiating yourselves and aggressively going after the channel that other IAC processors have built with a much more direct approach, which is consistent with the historic go to market strategy. So I can see that accreting the Heartland from a share and competitive standpoint.
Iâm trying to get a sense of what the ultimate earnings contribution is from the efforts it looks like among other things the investment will dampen 2015 margin all else being equal considering that these two acquisitions you announced today are neutral or slightly accretive.
So I wonder if you could build a timeline for us in terms of where you think we see the net benefits of this strategy particularly in the context of Leaf and how thatâs been a drag on earnings for the last couple of years?
Bob Carr
Fair question Andrew, we believe, weâve already seen with Xpient we closed Xpient on Halloween Day. And since that time several of their large customers have committed to move to our gift and loyalty programs. One of them has committed to moving over to our payment model, payment services.
And weâre talking about employ scheduling and payroll with the couple of others. We believe that over time, merchants as their contracts expire with their processors are going to seriously consider Heartland and the whole ballgame changes and this is something that is maybe not obvious is that when the dealer is selling our software, they're relying on us as much as weâre relying on them to have great products that can be delivered in the market. And they have those products serviced and integrated. So the dealers have a different value proposition now.
Up until this point whatâs the dealer's position? They go out, they have 100 ISOs talk to them about doing referring business to them and they cut the deal that has the most revenue for them and why wouldnât they? They are entrepreneurs trying to make a living.
With us when we -- when we're talking to the dealers, we have the ability to we price our product to them, we can give them a little bit better deal if theyâre referring business to us. And we have the ability to give them more functionality they might have a big customer.
We have a big customer in the middle right now 300 locations. We can customize the package a little bit to do something that they want to do. Thatâs going to win us the business. So the entire discussion changes where a dealer is reselling our product versus us bidding against every ISO in the world to give them more a bigger share of the revenue.
Andrew Jeffrey
Right and I appreciate the potential to take share, which I think is a real nice differentiating aspect of your strategy, I guess Iâm asking you specifically how that winds up accruing to earnings and in 2015 should we just view this is an investment year somewhat of a transformation year with better margins in '16, I guess thatâs part of the question and is there I guess as an adjunct is there some Heartland Summit expense as well that's built into the margin guidance you just gave us?
Bob Carr
Well Iâll take the first cut at that and let Samir to take the next cut. I believe 2015 we have tremendous revenue growth in 2015. And we wish we could have a better operating income margin increase than we can, but the big investment that weâre having to make is NEMV and the out of scope business.
And I think if we donât make that investment now, weâre going to miss the opportunity thatâs available to us right now and then also with the new accounting rules we have to write-off a lot of expense when we make an acquisition and that drags down our expenses as well.
So I believe weâre going to be in really great shape in terms of growth of our operating income starting towards the end of this year and itâs going to become much better in '16 and '17. Weâre doing major work here and it cost money and expenses to do it.
Andrew Jeffrey
Okay. And on the Heartland Summit expense?
Samir Zabaneh
So yes so the Heartland Summit will cost us between $3.5 million and $4 million as you know that doesnât happen every year. So the cost of the Heartland Summit is already built in our guidance.
Bob Carr
And that will be in the first quarter, weâre having it in two weeks and two plus weeks and then there wonât be a Summit next year, then it will be in '17, weâll be having just yes and again in '17.
Andrew Jeffrey
Okay. So just to sum up $3 million to $5 million of higher costs around Heartland Commerce and $3.5m to $4 million for the Summit?
Samir Zabaneh
Right and also there is one more point with respect to the margins, I mentioned in my remarks that our depreciation is increasing, not only because of the acquisitions, but the continued investments that we have that we said we would be making.
So from a cash flow point of view, if you look at the operating margin on the cash basis it is -- it will be far better increase than what you would see on the GAAP basis.
Mainly if you look across all of the details on the expenses, depreciation and amortizations would be having the biggest increase and thatâs because of the investments that weâre making and we must make it.
But the fundamentals of the business Iâm sure youâve heard us talk before, the fundamentals of this business will result in increased margins. I will still intent on increasing our margins over the next several years. We just have a really big opportunity right now that we need to capture. We continue to build platforms and businesses and these are all excellent for the long-term vision of the company. Our operative margin will increase.
Andrew Jeffrey
Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Tulu Yunus of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Tulu Yunus
Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just first on the POS side again. I am not sure if you did address this, but how many of your existing hospitality restaurant customers have a point of sale device already? Is it a very little amount?
Wondering if cross-selling into that base is part of the strategy or not?
Bob Carr
Yeah. Thatâs great question too. We tend to have the bigger main street America merchant and not the tiny one as reflected by the average volume of our SME customer, but we donât have an exact statistic.
I am speculating that probably 60% of our restaurants do have a point of sale system and 40% have a standalone terminal. And those with the standalone terminal I believe with the increased functionality we have, I think a lot of them will be going to our point of sales systems.
Because we are making that into a SaaS model and we have Heartland wanting to help them if they do want to do the acquisition they can get a very good loans to our American Express Lending Program.
So I think there are going to be some Greenfield opportunities to move merchants up in the technology chain, but by far the biggest opportunity is upgrading the 90,000 customers into the out of scope solution with better security and more functionality and we're going to offer a SaaS base model for that as well.
Tulu Yunus
Got you. Thanks Bob. And then Samir just on the results for '14 for a second the $2.34 that you referenced was $0.17 a drag from Leaf? Is that after -- or is that adjusted for that $4.6 million chargeback loss.
Samir Zabaneh
Yes.
Tulu Yunus
Okay. So just in terms of when you look back at the year overall, you guys did well on revenues and you beat your guidance there, but I guess especially because of the Leaf loss came in a little bit better I think than you thought in the fourth quarter?
Where was the disappointment in fourth quarter on a core basis just trying to figure that out because the EPS if you had a $0.19 earning drag from Leaf like you were expecting, EPS would have been $2.32 just a touch below your guidance while revenue outperformed. So was it margins and if so where?
Samir Zabaneh
Well I think -- it would be -- so our revenue was exceptionally strong. Our depreciation as I mentioned earlier has actually increased, but these are very good investments that we are making.
I would look at it overall that we have the key things in the fourth quarter we did mention about the one loss, our M&A costs have actually also increased. We closed deal during the quarter. So that has resulted in an impact on margins.
So basically the depreciations, M&A costs, these are really the two areas other than the one-time loss that we talked about early.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dane Hakus of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Dane Kaus
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one clarification and I had one other question, the Dinerware, pcAmerica for 2015 is expected to contribute what $12 million of revenues, TouchNet was $60 million and then can you just break down the HPY, the Heartland commerce, and Xpient? I just want to make sure that I am double counting there and then I have one follow-up after that?
Bob Carr
Okay. So pcAmerica and Dinerware are included in Heartland Commerce. So pcAmerica, Dinerware, Xpient, Liquor POS collectively -- currently makes $30 million.
Dane Kaus
Okay. And I think Xpient -- I think previously that was like $16 million expected contribution.
Bob Carr
We expect a minimum of $60 million in 2015. Sorry Xpient is $16 million.
Dane Kaus
And then Liquor POS is the difference.
Bob Carr
Yes.
Dane Kaus
Okay. And then the other question that I had is like earlier this week American Express announced that they werenât going to be revenue their program with Costco, the program with Costco and they talked about a couple different investment initiatives and I know that they've made the launch in OptBlue.
Have you guys seen or do you expect any shift maybe even potentially an expansion of the OptBlue program or anything that may impact your business?
Bob Carr
No.
Dane Kaus
Great thanks.

Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Chris Shutler
Yes good morning. Just wanted to get a quick update on the SPA strategy. So you attributed I think the sales force headcount reduction and I guess basically flat in the quarter. You attributed some of that to the SPA and I know you're talking about early success kind of cross-selling with Xpient and dealers there. So is there a bigger strategy shift here going on, may be just a little bit more color? Thanks.
Bob Carr
I wouldn't call it a strategy shift, but having these dealers and working with the dealers is taking a lot of time from our managers. It's not like we're trying to do a strategy shift so much as we have limited capability to talk to potential distributors for us and sales people as well.
So we're redundant -- we're going to grow our sales organization. There is areas where we definitely sales people and we're going to grow our dealer program as well.
Bob Baldwin
And the SPA, one thing we found was that we had a little too infrastructure for supporting the payroll side and so we're adding to the management infrastructure to support successful hires there.
But we're also broadening the SPA program. In the fourth quarter, we added a number of people in the -- what we call Heartland Building, which is really an ATH business that we're offering to municipalities and utilities and others.
The specialist concept if you think about dealer they are a specialist in that is one that we're embracing have been for a while as a great adjunct to our general SRM for us which will also continue to grow.
Samir Zabaneh
We look at the installed margin number as the key to our success and distribution and expand setting records quarter by quarter and continues to do that and that's the ultimate, I think metric.
Operator
Next question is from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
David Hochstim
Thanks. Could you clarify what the expense impact is from the latest acquisitions less than $12 million, butâ¦
Samir Zabaneh
Sorry, can you repeat the question?
Bob Carr
Expensing impact -- it's less than $12 million. It's going to be as we said, it's going to have similar margins to our overall business. So it's going be in the $9 million or $10 million area.
David Hochstim
Okay. And then could you just explain what happened with TabbedOut?
Bob Carr
So TabbedOut we looked at the evaluation at which we invested in the company. Based on various scenarios that we run internally, we felt that the value at which we came is actually impaired. It has nothing -- there is no reflection on the company itself. The company is still up and running, but we feel our valuation in that company has been impaired.
Operator
Our next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kartik Mehta
Bob, I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you said about these acquisitions and cross sales. It seems as though cross sales are inherently difficult, but is there something that may be, that's in this business model or that you've had success with that gives you confidence that you will be able to achieve some of those cross sales you talked about?
Bob Carr
Well we have a robust history with it and the fact that we have the functionality we're in control of the functionality of the product means a whole lot. We dictate what hardware requirements there are and by having control of the functionality of the product it allows us to do things with our dealers that can only be done by us.
So we think we have a real nice runway ahead of us based on those factors.
Bob Baldwin
Dealers are a little different in terms of cross sale than your general relationship manager. The dealer has an ongoing interaction as they support the system that's been installed at the merchant and so it's a little bit different than our relationship manager who is really on to the next sale primarily.
So as we can offer those solutions, that dealer has always got an opportunity to add a product, say the person; hey, you thought about doing this or youâre playing about how your payroll didnât work this time, they are more. So there is an opportunity that I think is a little bit better than for the general SRM.
Operator
Our next question is from Steven Kwok of KBW. Please go ahead.
Steven Kwok
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question around if we were to think about, all the acquisitions combined and everything how does the revenue growth look going forward as we look at into 2016?
And then on top of that, if I just do the midpoint of your guidance range, I could say like adjusted operating margin about 21.7%. I was wondering if thatâs correct and then are you guys still targeting that 25% margin goal.
Samir Zabaneh
Sure, so we are targeting that 25% margins goal. On an adjusted basis your operating margin is in line with what we would expect and in terms of growth, I think your first part of the question was the growth of the overall businesses, all of that non-card businesses as I mentioned earlier will grow at the mid teen low to mid teen levels.
And Heartland Commerce will grow at that level. These companies that make up the Heartland Commerce are actually growing at that level, but we believe once we finish the work there, that growth was going to accelerate.
And then the core, the core business as you saw this quarter and last quarter, that will continue to accelerate. So overall when we mentioned those percentages of revenue growth we feel very comfortable with that.
Operator
Our next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chris Brendler
Hi thanks good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to step up, I guess there are lot of moving parts this quarter. It looks like really strong results especially in the core card business. I know you got an OptBlue catch up as you mentioned, but the volume growth and the outlook seems like you've got a lot of traction there.
And then you add in the acquisitions this quarters the $12 million of new acquisitions, whatâs the headwind on your growth, your revenue growth next year the guidance seems to be more in line but doesnât include the $12 million and does include the strong result this quarter.
So Iâm kind of confused on what the headwind is on your revenue growth and is embedded in your guidance. This is some conservatism around macro or EMV can you explain that please?
Samir Zabaneh
Iâm trying to figure out the headwind, we did not assume so let me give you may be a little bit of color in terms of the core business. So our same store sales will be between 2% and 3%, which is better than what we had last year and so far in January we are in line with that. So thatâs not a headwind. Thatâs better than what we had last year.
Our net attrition taking the same store sales into account will be between 12% and 14%, that is better than what we had last years and then the installed margin continues to get stronger and stronger and we donât see a headwind coming in that regard.
The market is so big and we feel weâre still scratching the surface in terms of what we can do. When you look across all of our platforms whether it's the education, payroll or the new Heartland Commerce, they all are going to not only enable cross-sell between each other, but hopefully will eventually earned a business to drive even more volume through these platforms, just like we did with the school solutions.
We hope to do that with TouchNet and we of course, we hope to earn the business on the School Solution.
So quite honestly we feel really good as to where the business is going. We feel our revenue guidance is strong and weâre not feeling any headwind. So what the risks could be? The risks could be that same store sales will not come up to the same way that we expect them to be.
And somehow we stop being able to drive installed margin which I donât expect that to happen. So really Chris, Iâm trying to figure out what would the headwind and right now I donât see any. We are driving across the whole business everything is going well.

Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.
Brett Huff
Good morning, Bob and Samir and congrats on a nice quarter.
Bob Carr
Thank you.
Brett Huff
I want to go back to make sure I understand the kind of how the sales process and compensation will work with the new dealers. We've always been big fans of the fact that you all own your sales force and you compensate them correctly on gross margin dollars.
Can you just give us I guess specifically if Iâm a dealer and Iâm working with a relationship manager, it seems like I might get compensated or the dealer might get compensated both like a finder's fee or referral fee if an RM gets a lead from that dealer, but is there also a residual kind of fee to the dealer that will keep them incensed and continue to refer me business, how does that kind of work?
Bob Carr
Yeah, there is referral or there are residual paid to the dealer. They're taking the phone calls and they're also going out and servicing the equipment. So the sales people, first of all our service cost are reduced and the sales person gives up some of their commission because they have someone installing the account and also they have -- there are referrals back and forth.
It's sort of the ideal situation they're helping one another and that has been working for us quite nicely.
