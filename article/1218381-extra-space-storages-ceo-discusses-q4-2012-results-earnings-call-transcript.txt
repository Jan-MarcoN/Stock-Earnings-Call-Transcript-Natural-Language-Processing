Spencer F. Kirk
Good afternoon, everyone. We donât typically go last amongst our peers, so this has been a nice change to have a chance to see everyoneâs results and hear what they have had to say on their calls. For Extra Space, 2012 was a superb year. We produced strong operational results due to multiple factors. They include record high occupancy levels, excellent expense control, potent internet marketing, sophisticated revenue management, a high volume of accretive acquisitions and virtually no new supply.
With the exception of the Storage USA transaction in 2005, this was our single largest acquisition year. We acquired 91 assets in 24 states and grew our wholly owned portfolio by 26%. Our unique structure continues to provide us with numerous options for growth. The result, 71% of our acquisitions came from joint venture and third-party managed relationships. The credit for the outstanding results in 2012 goes to our talented, creative and hardworking team. Time and time again I have spoken of our unique levers that have driven our double-digit FFO growth.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, FFO grew by 23%. This is particularly impressive when you consider that the fourth quarter of 2011 was up 35% over 2010, and for the full year, FFO grew 33% on top of 32% growth in 2011 over 2010.
Iâll now turn the time to Karl to discuss operations.
Karl Haas
Thanks, Spence. During the fourth quarter, we once again experienced excellent same-store revenue growth of 6.5%, and thatâs on top of 5.8% revenue growth we realized in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, revenue was up 6.6% compared to 4.9% in 2011. While the pools were different in these years, it shows an ongoing positive operational trend.
Rental trends were strong in the fourth quarter and our square foot occupancy continued at record high levels. Our same-store pool ended the year at 88.6%, up 1.7% over last year. Demand for the product is stable and our interactive marketing and internet strategies continue to drive higher rental volumes. Strong occupancy coupled with the lack of new supply allowed us to increase street rates 3.5% to 4% on average for the quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we also had excellent expense growth that was partially offset by higher property taxes and Superstorm Sandy. Same-store discounts ended the year at 4.3% of rental income, compared to 5.3% at the start of the year. Overall, discounts were down by 12%. This is due to higher occupancy and a focused effort to offer the right price and promotion.
All this combined to produce the fourth quarter same-store net operating income of 8.5%, compared to 9.3% growth last year. Net operating income for the full year was 10.2% versus 7.6% in 2011. All in all, it was one of the best years I have seen in my 25 years in this business.
And now, Iâd like to turn it over to Scott.
Scott Stubbs
Thanks, Karl. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter FFO of $0.43 per share including a $0.02 charge related to our acquisitions and $0.01 from Superstorm Sandy. For the year, we reported FFO of $1.59 per share, exceeding the top end of our guidance by $0.01. This can be attributed primarily to better-than-expected same-store property results and the performance and timing of our 2012 acquisitions.
As Spencer mentioned, 2012 was a great year for acquisitions. We purchased 91 properties for just over $700 million. Of these 91 properties, 57 were from the two large joint venture transactions. Since the end of the year, we have purchased our partnerâs interest in two more properties located in Baltimore and Chicago for approximately $12.9 million.
As of today, we have two assets under contract for $20.6 million located in Maryland and Texas. One of these two assets is a brand new asset that we are buying at [Ciavo]. As of the end of the year, we had 448 wholly-owned, 281 joint venture properties and 181 third-party properties under management. We continue to growth the REIT in a disciplined manner with a long-term view.
As of December 31, the Company had four lines of credit with a total capacity of $240 million of which $85 million was drawn. Interest rates continue to be at all-time lows. Without increasing our variable rate exposure, we have lowered our average interest rate from 4.7% at the end of 2011 to 4.2% at the end of 2012.
Yesterday, we released our full year 2013 FFO guidance of between $1.87 and $1.95 per share. We expect FFO for the first quarter to be between $0.42 and $0.44. Key annual assumptions related to these estimates can be found in our press release from yesterday.
Iâll now turn the time back to Spencer.
Spencer F. Kirk
Thanks Scott. Last year at this time, I stated that our theme for 2012 was to focus on fundamentals. Since we donât have a MasterCard, weâre going to stick with the theme, for 2013 it is, do it better. Everything we do is in pursuit of maximizing revenue opportunities and appropriately minimizing expenses.
Our focus on the fundamentals has served our shareholders well in 2012 and will continue to serve them well as we move into 2013. Record high occupancy, constrained supply in our operational sophistication set us up to again produce double-digit FFO growth in 2013.
With that, Iâd like to turn the time over to Clint to start our Q&A session.
Clint Halverson
Thank you, Spencer. In order to ensure we have adequate time to address everyoneâs questions, Iâd like to ask that everyone keep your initial questions brief and if possible limited to two. If time allows, weâll address follow-on questions once everyoneâs had an opportunity to ask their initial questions.
With that, weâll turn it over to Shaquana to start our Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Todd Thomas, representing KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Todd Thomas â KeyBanc Capital Markets
Hi, good afternoon. First question, in terms of investments, you probably have cash sort of the largest investment in that or the widest I guess in terms of what youâre interested in markets and properties, and some of your peers seem to be a little more selective. Can you just talk about your investment rationale a little bit, and then given that, are you seeing sort of reduced competition on acquisitions to the market sort of opening up a little bit for EXR?
Spencer F. Kirk
Todd, its Spencer. Letâs take the broader question. We look at open market acquisitions and then what Iâll call off-market acquisitions. In the open market acquisitions, there continues to be a lot of money chasing what seems to be relatively small number of properties given the size of the total industry. And we just want to participate, but we also want to remain disciplined and make sure that the acquisitions we do are accretive.
On the off-market acquisitions, those out at the partnerships that we have, we have been pleased with what weâve done. Weâve sold out over 280 assets held in joint venture relationships and we hope that at some point in the future when those partners decide that itâs time to monetize their assets that will be the first call and hopefully the only call when it comes time to transact.
Todd Thomas â KeyBanc Capital Markets
And then second question, just looking at your occupancy today, it appears that thereâs still some occupancy upside in the same-store as it stands, but next quarter when the same-store pool resets and the new, I guess, 2011 acquisitions are included, what will occupancy look like for the same-store pool then? Iâm just trying to get sense from a same-store perspective whether or not we should expect to see occupancy fall as the pool resets a little bit and what the magnitude of occupancy upside will then look like as we look into 2013?
Spencer F. Kirk
We donât have the exact numbers right now, but we plan on addressing that at the end of the first quarter. We are expecting that the occupancy will fall slightly. As the pool changes, weâll be adding a fair number of properties to that pool.
Todd Thomas â KeyBanc Capital Markets
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing UBS. Please proceed.
Christine McElroy â UBS
Hi, guys, good afternoon. You said it was about $0.01 in your release, but I was wondering if you could quantify the exact Sandy impact and can you describe the nature of the expenses? And did it all flow through OpEx or were there other income statement lines impacted?
Scott Stubbs
It flowed through two items actually. It flowed through property operating expenses to the tune of about $0.5 million and then about $900,000 flowed through the insurance company.
Christine McElroy â UBS
And then with regard to tenant reinsurance, where would you say you are today on overall portfolio penetration? What percentage of new customers opts for the insurance? And if you look at the 18% year-over-year growth in reinsurance revenues in 2012, how much would you say has been driven by continued increases in penetration in your own portfolio versus the benefit that you get if you add managed properties?
Karl Haas
This is Karl. The penetration on new tenants is above 90%. Our overall penetration is in the high 60s. And I donât really have a breakdown of whatâs coming between the new from the third-party management versus just the increase from existing customers. Iâm sure we can get that, but we donât have it handy.
Christine McElroy â UBS
If itâs in the high 60s today, do you have what it was a year ago?
Scott Stubbs
It was about in the mid-60s.
Spencer F. Kirk
The one thing that is clear though Christy is that growth does slow the higher it gets. So a larger amount of our growth does come as we add managed properties.
Christine McElroy â UBS
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Toti representing Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Hey, good morning, guys.
Spencer F. Kirk
Hi, Dave.
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Quick question Spencer for you, now that weâve seen the forecasts from your peer group relative to expectations for next year, your top line forecast seem a little bit conservative given whatâs been pretty clear pricing power over the last couple of quarters. Then you touched on this before, but can you give us some background on maybe why youâre being a little bit hesitant going forward despite the evidence of pricing power over the last couple of quarters? What makes you sort of hold back in expectations for rent growth prospects?
Spencer F. Kirk
The answer, David is our methodology for providing guidance and visibility has not changed. We are at the very beginning of a year. There is a lot of uncertainty out there and weâve looked down the road and said what can we reasonably expect to happen.
And as weâve rolled up our property level budgets baked everything together, we have come to the conclusion that where we are is our best guess as to where we think we might end up with a full year behind us with the benefit of hindsight. There is a lot of churn out there. Occupancy, yeah, there might be a little more gain. We need to see where street rates come in this year. But I think that the guidance weâve given is what we accurately believe we can produce.
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
And then, can you just maybe give us a little bit more detail in terms of the mix in that top line? And I apologize I jumped on a little bit late. But is it possible to disaggregate the sort of new versus renewal growth thatâs embedded in that top line?
Karl Haas
As far as the exact percentages, David or what specificallyâ¦?
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Yeah, I mean no, just a very rough number, but what are you assuming relative to the kind of growth youâre going to see on renewal rates going forward?
Karl Haas
Part of that growth obviously is coming from the occupancy delta. We expect to get a bit of an occupancy delta this year. The next largest contributor is discounts. Discounts will continue to be below where they were last year as our occupancy remains highs. And then to a lesser degree, itâs going to be street rates, and probably last in that list is existing customer rate increases.
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Okay. And then just one follow-up question, what are some plans relative to technology improvements that you might have going forward relative to your revenue management systems? I know you guys are pretty far out relative to the specification of this system, but what are some improvements you might be looking at putting in place or expecting to begin to perform?
Spencer F. Kirk
David, its Spencer. Actually, I wonât look for any quantum leap. We are on our third-generation of revenue management. Today, we track 56 different inputs and variables and metrics to help us define our pricing and I think itâs going to be more of refinement out on the margin rather than any wholesale new initiative or way of looking at things. Thatâs really a continuation of what weâve already been doing. And that is taking what we are learning from our data and applying it with finer granularity.
Karl Haas
This is Karl. We will also be focusing more on discounts, trying to get smarter and how we offer the discount, when we offer the discount, and that will also have an impact.
David Toti â Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.
Okay, great. Thanks for the detail.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe, representing Citi. Please proceed.
Eric Wolfe â Citigroup
Hey guys, thinking back to NAREIT, there was a decent amount of talk about PSA jumping their street rates by like 9% overnight. Iâm just curious whether youâve seen any sort of incremental improvement in pricing powers since that happened or things just have remained pretty consistently strong?
Karl Haas
This is Karl. We are pushing rates, but itâs in the 4% to 5% range. And I think what youâre going to find too is, as when we get these questions about where your street rates are versus existing customer rates, our rates are â our overall GPI and the percent change every month and even during the month is going all over the place.
I mean weâre adjusting constantly, so you almost have to look at it over a longer period of time and itâs in the range of 4% to 5%. Weâd like to think that â and I think this is probably the biggest upside potential thatâs out there, is as we all continue to get better occupancy that we might have the opportunity to push those rates even more, especially if no new competition comes along.
Eric Wolfe â Citigroup
Gotcha, thatâs helpful. And then second question, I guess bit of a change of topic, but as your stock continues to work and your cost of capital comes down as a result, what type of unlevered return do you think makes sense on acquisitions for your shareholders? Iâm just wondering whether that metric change as your stock does better and your cost of capital moves lower?
Scott Stubbs
We consider that. Obviously, we consider our short-term cost of capital, but we also can ignore the long-term cost of capital. So, there are times when we might be slightly more aggressive as our short-term cost of capital goes down, but I think that your unlevered IRRs are still somewhere 8 to 10.
Eric Wolfe â Citigroup
Gotcha. Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott representing Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Hi, guys. Spencer, when you say that acquisition should be accretive, do you mean accretive only to earnings or would you consider acquiring an attractively priced lease-up situation that that may not immediately be accretive to earnings?
Spencer F. Kirk
Yes, we would consider looking at those lease-up situations and take a short hit on dilution. What we donât want to do is get whipped into frenzy with the rest of the market and pay rates that may not look so great five years from now.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
What were your thoughts on the Acadia sale? Were you an active bidder on that transaction?
Spencer F. Kirk
We were not.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Okay, thanks.
Spencer F. Kirk
Thanks, Michael.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible) representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. Looking at your same-store results by region, there are some differences obviously. So, first in terms of occupancy, would you say that your goal occupancy varies by region? For example, Chicago was able to increase about 7% to 90%, but Houston is still below 80% or is there difference â is there a reason for the differences by region?
Karl Haas
This is Karl. Yes.
Unidentified Analyst
Could you tell us what they might be?
Karl Haas
At some markets itâs a lot easier to get in. Theyâre a lot stronger and weâre able to push to our goal overall occupancy quicker than in other markets. I mean, thereâs a certain drag that trying to cover or to overcome an occupancy gap in a shorter period of time, the cost can be significant. And so we do it more gradually and our system is looking to get you there, but they are going to get you there â itâs going to get you there in a way that maximizes the opportunity along the way.
So if youâre at 80%, yeah, you could get the 90% pretty quickly if you wanted to, and we could, but weâd rather do it over a longer period of time and give away less and end up getting more of the whole way through it and we will get to our goal occupancy.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then also in terms of the variations between the different regions, it just comes out, I donât if itâs a coincidence or not, but Chicago, it looked like had the largest reduction in expenses about 20% lower, but then Houstonâs are about 20% higher with everybody else kind of in between there. Can you maybe tell us why some are doing so much better on expenses than others?
Karl Haas
Itâs a very micro property-by-property. It has nothing to do with occupancy. It has a lot more to do with just variations and it can be just kind of a quirk of the particular properties in that market. But thereâs no plan, and really is no correlation between rent per square foot. It can be property taxes as well.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Salinsky, representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
Good afternoon guys. Can you talk a little bit about January and February trends?
Karl Haas
This is Karl. Itâs really pretty much the same as it has been. Expenses are up a little bit because we had a little snowstorm in the Northeast that hit us pretty good, and so weâre going to have a little bit of variation as a result of the snow. But otherwise revenues that theyâre really holding, occupancy is holding, weâre really pretty pleased with where we are, and itâs pretty much according to our plan.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
Okay. Second of all, you gave a little bit of color on street rates; I think you said 3.5% to 4% up in the fourth quarter. Just as we kind of look at the delta between move-in and move-out rates as you guys have been pushing aggressively on renewals, the street rates have improved, but not quite kept pace. So how is the delta right now between move-in and move-out rents versus kind of a year ago?
Karl Haas
It is about the same.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
Is about the same?
Karl Haas
Yes.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
Okay. And then finallyâ¦
Karl Haas
But once again, it is difficult to take a point in time, because our street rates are up and down so much. But when we look at it over a longer period of time, the gap is about the same now as it was a year ago.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
And what is your expectation for street rate growth then in 2013? I mean, I realize itâs on a â it is kind of on a bell curve, but just curious as to what youâre kind of thinkingâ¦
Karl Haas
Now, 4% to 5% that weâve been talking about.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
4% to 5%, okay.
Karl Haas
Yes.
Michael Salinsky â RBC Capital Markets
And then finally, just in terms of acquisitions, the amount of deal that youâre seeing right now, how does that compare versus this time a year ago, and are you seeing greater â I mean, with that interest tick-up if pricing were to compress?
Spencer F. Kirk
Michael, its Spencer. I would say year-over-year interest is about the same. Itâs the beginning of a New Year. We donât have the surge that usually happens in the fourth quarter when people are trying to transact. So year-over-year, itâs about the same and quite frankly, if there is some more cap rate compression, there may be some more sellers. But right now, the question, I think a lot of sellers have is, if I sell my self-storage property and pay taxes, where am I going to reinvest my money and have as good of return as Iâm getting out this existing asset.

Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed.
Omotayo Okusanya â Jefferies & Co.
Hi, yes, good afternoon. Just in regards to the 2013 guidance. I mean, I think you guys have done a great job of telegraphing the potential slowdown on the top line, but in regards to the operating expense and the forecast, could you talk about some of the big ticket items that are kind of driving that large increase?
Scott Stubbs
Your largest increases are going to come from really three items. Itâs going to be payroll, property taxes, and credit cards. Credit cards, we had a positive delta last year that has gone away. Property taxes, we havenât seen major increases for several years and weâre forecasting, depending on the area, 3% to 4% on those.
Omotayo Okusanya â Jefferies & Co.
On the credit card side, is it just swipe fees are going up or interchange fees are going up or what is it?
Scott Stubbs
Theyâre not going up, but what happened last year is there were some new rules enacted that enabled us to process debit cards more like an ACH, so you werenât charged credit card interchange on those.
Omotayo Okusanya â Jefferies & Co.
Okay.
Scott Stubbs
So it saved us a significant amount as well as everyone in the business.
Karl Haas
This is Karl. Last year it offset our increases. We donât expect an enormous increase this year, but weâre not going to get the significant decrease that we got last year.
Omotayo Okusanya â Jefferies & Co.
Got it. And then just a quick second question. I mean are there any markets at this point where youâre actually seeing a slowdown in demand simply because the consumer is actually paying higher taxes and has a smaller paycheck to take home now?
Karl Haas
This is Karl again. No, we have not seen that. I mean, I know that a lot of retailers are and a lot of ad hoc information out there, but we have not have seen that yet.
Omotayo Okusanya â Jefferies & Co.
Okay. Thatâs helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick, representing Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Tom Lesnick â Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hey, guys Iâm just filling in for Paula today. A couple of quick questions; first, I just want to talk about the private operator lending environment. What trends are you guys seeing and how have those trends changed at all in the past few months or so?
Spencer F. Kirk
I think for stabilized assets, just about anyone can get a loan. Obviously, I think from what weâre seeing is, it seems like those with money and with scale, itâs easier to get debt for those individuals than for a smaller individual. Not a lot of asset â I mean, not a lot of appetite for non-revenue producing or lease-up assets.
Tom Lesnick â Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
All right. And then I guess secondly, are you guys seeing any trends in your tenant mix, maybe more home driven renters or business driven renters?
Karl Haas
This is Karl again. No.
Tom Lesnick â Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks, thatâs all Iâve got.
Spencer F. Kirk
Thanks, Tom.

(Operator Instructions) You have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Knott representing Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Hey, Spencer, I think you got a version of this question earlier. But with regard to continued attempts to better maximize price and price the product as well as you can, where do you think youâre at now if you think about it on a scale 1 to 10 with 10 being sort of a perfect ability to maximize price to every single customer? Where youâre at now and where do you think you can get to in the next couple of years?
Karl Haas
Iâll give you a good solid three. I think there is a lot of upside, a lot of learning and a lot more that can be done, and I think the application of Big Data and mining our data semantically to better refine our models will yet yield better results, but we are far from the end game on this. Weâre far from perfection.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
So is that good news just for Extra Space or do you think thatâs sort of a signal that the entire industry going to have maybe above inflation type rent growth over some extended period of time?
Karl Haas
I would maybe characterize it more towards those larger operators that have the resources to go after a disproportionate share of whatâs to be had. I think that what weâre doing? For instance, we have six revenue management people in our department. The small operator I highly doubt is ever going to be anywhere close to that. And for us, I think this is as the other publicly traded companies have stated many, many times, benefit that the publicly traded companies possess.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Yeah, thanks. And then a couple other ones for me. Is the $150 million of acquisition guidance for the year just a pure guess on the conservative side or is there some signs behind that?
Scott Stubbs
How about a guess?
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Okay.
Scott Stubbs
And Iâm not trying to be spread out, but we just donât know what the philosophy of transactions will be this year at the price point at which weâre willing to transact. So itâs purely a guess.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
And guidance was; are those loaded in somewhat evenly over the year guys?
Spencer F. Kirk
Yes.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Okay. And then last one. Scott, can you remind us of the solar tax credits and what the magnitude of that in the guidance is?
Scott Stubbs
Itâs $5 million to $6 million this year as far as benefiting the current year.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
And whatâs the duration of that program and can it be replaced at some point?
Scott Stubbs
Right now I believe it goes through 2016. So we started with the best returns on investment and then weâve gone down from there. But we are also still trying to be fairly conservative in what level of investment weâre willing to make for the return.
Michael Knott â Green Street Advisors
Thank you.
Scott Stubbs
Thanks Michael.
