Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, John. I'm very pleased that we delivered a strong Q1. I believe that our results were a reflection of both the health of the hosted unified communications market and our leadership position in it. So I thought I would spend some time today providing some more insight into our market opportunities, and the advantages we bring to bear in addressing them.
First of all, we feel we're in midst of a great market. The world is moving from premise-based to cloud-based business solutions. From a hosted unified communications perspective, we're still very early in that migration. We talked last quarter about having 10 million end users on our platform and we're proud of that milestone number. It makes us an order of magnitude larger than any of our competitors. Having said that, keep in mind that it only still represents less than 2% penetration of what we believe will be a 700 million user addressable market in several years.
Let me provide a little more background on that market size estimate. Today, legacy PBX vendors still sell about 50 million extensions a year, most of which are replacements for older systems, which typically get refreshed on a seven-year to 10-year cycle. That implies an installed base of 350 million to 500 million PBX lines that are primed to transform to cloud-based solutions. That figure, while large by itself, doesn't take into account a number of important adjacent markets that add materially to our addressable market.
Let me explain. There is also significant incremental subscriber opportunities within the base of small business employees that use simple pots lines, the installed base of old TDM Centrex users and most importantly, the growing class of mobile-only business users. So, even at a market-leading 10 million cumulative end users, we feel that we haven't really even scratched the surface of the available market and still have significant headroom left in front of us in both the wireline and wireless worlds.
I'd note one important point. There is a big difference between what one can claim as a total addressable market versus what portion is truly serviceable. The 700 million subscriber opportunity we just mentioned is not a homogeneous group. The organizations that encompass these end users are spread across the world and come in all different flavors and sizes with different needs and requirements. We believe that we are unmatched in our ability to target nearly that entire base due to two main factors. First is the scalability and robustness of our platform and second is the reach and channel breadth afforded us by our service provider leverage go-to-market model.
On the first point, we often talk about our products' market-leading scalability, and when we do, it's usually in the context of our ability to handle very large enterprise environments with all of their complexity from having tens of thousands of users in different locations using disparate solutions. But just as important as our ability to scale up to the high end of the market is our ability to scale down to the SOHO and SMB segments. Being able to cost effectively enable unified communications for 50,000 small businesses each with two employees is a much different proposition from enabling a couple of 50,000-person enterprises. But that's exactly what we can do and it's the real differentiator for us.
We also excel at a hybrid of these two cases, meaning a large enterprise that consists of a federation of very large number of small distributed sites. This is a use case that is difficult for others to address.
Regarding go-to-market, as we talked about last quarter, our business model is focused on selling to enterprise customers through service providers. Our portfolio of over 600 service provider partners, in aggregate, provides an extensive global reach that has resulted in BroadSoft-based unified communications end users in over 80 countries around the world. It also creates a set of differentiated solutions that provide a range of attractive service options for end customers.
To illustrate what I mean, let's drill down into a key market segment, small businesses in the United States. We believe that there are about 25 million to 30 million people just within the United States that are employed by firms with 50 or fewer employees. With such a sizeable population, the SMB market itself is far from being monolithic; a service offer that appeals to one customer may not resonate with another, and so a variety of approaches are necessary.
This market dynamic dovetails nicely with the wide range of differentiated BroadSoft-based service offerings available to the SMB market from various service providers targeting this space. Some carriers are leveraging their last mile broadband infrastructure to offer a bundled business triple play package. Some pitch an easy-to-use, low-cost Web-centric approach. Others take the opposite tack and are providing a high-touch white-glove customer service model, while still others are focused on enabling the broadest possible unified communication experience, including mobile integration.
It's the availability of these multiple tailored solutions that will engage customers and drive our hosted unified communications penetrations level higher within the small business market. Happily for us, the diversity of end customers that exist here also exists in many other market segments. That provides us the same ability to leverage multiple service providers to create differentiated service offers, targeting those markets as well.
With service providers being key to BroadSoft's go-to-market, I wanted to spend some time on our channel programs. Recall that our company's mantra is simplify, innovate, and accelerate. Channel programs are a key part of the accelerate piece, designed to assist service providers in growing their customer base and revenue. These are an important part of our overall sell-through activities, and we regard them as win-wins for ourselves and our customers.
The goal of our channel acceleration teams is to create a set of reproducible processes and metrics that can migrate from one service provider to another. These processes are a combination of seminars, workshops, consulting engagements, and channel incentive programs. The return for these efforts is measured as an acceleration in adoption, and there are already a number of positive success stories. For example, one Tier 1 carrier doubled its monthly subscriber adds within a six-month timeframe; another Tier 2 carrier more than doubled subscribers adds within a nine-month period. We have a number of people staffed in these channel acceleration teams, and believe that incremental investment in them will drive positive results.
Lastly, I wanted to give a brief update on our network transformation activities. As you can see from our elevated professional services revenue in Q1, we were able to recognize revenue on some of our initial work. A material amount of that professional services revenue was related to a Voice over Wi-Fi project, which recently had a successful launch. Voice over Wi-Fi is an emerging requirement for a number of the network transformation projects being proposed. The value proposition is clear. Mobile operators as they move to roll out IP-centric 4G-based radio access networks, are looking for solutions to provide additional capacity in congested urban areas and coverage for in-building settings.
By leveraging an existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to do so, they can reduce the investment in their expensive macro networks, while still providing high levels of network availability. Our product's extremely well suited to address these Voice over Wi-Fi opportunities. We sit in the software layer, providing the intelligence to enable communications over IP and we're essentially indifferent to the underlying radio network; whether it be LTE or Wi-Fi, we excel at both. We expect to see more Voice over Wi-Fi projects on a going-forward basis and will talk more about it later in the year.
So in summary, I'm very happy with how we've executed so far in 2015. We believe that we're in an attractive market with the right product and strategy, and we look forward to continue our momentum for the rest of the year.
With that, let me now hand the call over to Jim, who'll go through our results. Afterwards, I will be happy to answer any questions. Jim?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Michael. With our Q1, we feel we had a great start to the year. As you can see from our earnings press release, we reported healthy revenue and earnings results. I'd also note the strength in billings in the quarter with the software billings growth relative to Q1 of last year especially encouraging. Q1s are seasonally difficult quarters for us, given purchasing cycles with our service provider customers, so we are really pleased with how the quarter came in.
Here are the Q1 headlines. Total revenue was $56 million, up 27% from the year-ago quarter. There was a couple of hundred thousand dollar negative impact to our top-line from recent foreign exchange fluctuations. Billings which we define as revenue plus a net change in deferred revenue were $56 million, up 38% year-over-year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.24 versus $0.07 in the year-ago period. We had a new 10% customer in the quarter. I'll also provide some more detail on revenue and billings. Software license revenue was $23 million, up 34% year-over-year. Software license billings were $27 million, up a very strong 73% year-over-year. The billing strength is driven by our core hosted UC business. Sell-through on hosted remained healthy.
Finally, we saw year-over-year billings growth in all regions led by North America. Our subscription and maintenance support revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $25 million. Maintenance support revenue of $17 million was up 11% year-over-year. Cloud SaaS revenue of $8.1 million grew from $7.5 million in Q4 2014 and from $5.6 million in the year-ago period. Professional services and other revenue was $7 million, it was up 30% year-over-year and billings were $5 million, up 31% from the year-ago period. This professional services revenue level was the highest in the company's history and was driven by revenue recognition from the large transformation project that Mike mentioned.
I want to be a little more precise about what we mean when we talk about network transformation deals. They consist of projects where a service provider migrates its existing TDM, first-gen IP, or legacy mobile network to a BroadSoft-powered IP solution. They also include projects where a service provider builds a next-generation mobile infrastructure based on either Voice over LTE, Voice over Wi-Fi or both. In Q1, we've recognized several million dollars of revenue both in software and professional services from transformation projects. A significant portion of this was Voice over Wi-Fi and Voice over LTE related, with our solid execution in Q1, we believe that for the year, we're on track to deliver against the commitments we've made to our customers related to these large transformation projects.
Now, moving on to cost and margins, in Q1, we had gross margin of 76%, which was flat with the year-ago quarter. The gross margin themes in Q1 were similar to prior quarters where we have seen strong and even improving software gross margins offset somewhat by a continued product mix shift to our cloud business which had margins in the quarter of low-to-mid 40%s. Professional services and other margin was a strong 44% which was essentially flat with the year-ago period.
Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $35 million and operating margin was 14% versus 6% a year ago. Operating expenses were up sequentially over Q4 with the biggest increase coming in R&D driven in part from our January acquisition of Leonid Systems. From an overall expense perspective, we did come in below our own expectations largely as a result of head count adds being lower than anticipated. We did add almost a 100 new employees and contractors in Q1, taking our total to 995.
We plan to continue to press on this investment for the rest of the year and our planned expense growth is focused on several key areas. First, as we mentioned last quarter, we have a number of large projects on which we are executing. This drives both R&D and professional services costs. We are also driving innovation, especially around BroadCloud, mobility and the user experience. We want to make sure we continue to expand our market and innovation leadership position.
And lastly, we continue to be focused on helping our service provider customers, accelerate their growth in this very attractive market space. While we are light from an expense standpoint in Q1, we want to give ourselves the operating flexibility that provide us for the remainder of the year, to further ramp investment in the areas I just mentioned. Specifically for Q2, we anticipate the cost of sales will increase approximately $1 million over Q1, primarily driven by the cloud and PS businesses. Q2 OpEx is likely to be up about $3 million, due to a full quarter's worth of expenses associated with the new hires in Q1, and additional head count and other investments, primarily in R&D and sales.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $225 million at the end of the first quarter. Accounts receivable of $73 million, were down from $82 million in Q4, given normal seasonal trends. Given the strength in billings in Q1, deferred revenue of $101 million was essentially unchanged from Q4 versus a normal seasonal decline. Net cash from operations in the quarter was a healthy $15 million, if one excludes the aggregate impact of what are actually non-cash tax accounting driven adjustments.
Now on to guidance, as you saw on our earnings press release, we expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $59 million to $64 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.24 to $0.36. For the year, our annual guidance for revenue remains in the range of $260 million to $268 million, even with a couple of million dollar incremental headwind from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Full year EPS is now in the range of a $1.42 to a $1.66.
Let me close by reiterating that we had a great start to the year. We are very pleased with the momentum in our hosted UC offerings and delighted we could show further evidence of our strength in the cloud and mobility aspects of our business.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer questions. Operator, would you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you. Nice quarter, gentlemen.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Good morning again. So, can you kind of refresh our memory on the five transformational deals that you have so far, what stages are they in? I know you mentioned a couple of million dollars in Q1. How many of those deals actually are revenue this year versus 2016 and beyond? So, that's my first question.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So Dmitry, I mean, we have a number, I think we've alluded to â I take your word for it, five in particular and it's a mix. As Mike said last quarter, we think of these things as big construction projects that some of the ones that we announced earlier on or we have acceptance there, even some in market, others have longer durations and/or were announced more recently and so those are more in the 2016 timeframe including that large international one that we mentioned Q2 of last year. So, everything is from our perspective on track with those projects. Each of them are multiple millions in total revenue opportunity for us and are all on track. I think, you'll see when you do the math for this year that there is definitely like we normally have some backend load to the year and part of that is in fact where we'll take revenue on a few of these projects.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And thank you for that, Jim; and I couldn't help, but notice, you said, couple million dollars of these big transformation projects that hit revenue this quarter, but you certainly had very healthy billings number as well as the revenue. So that sort of means that you had strength from other parts of the business outside those transformation deals. Is that fair to assume? And if so, can you maybe discuss what exactly is driving this billings growth?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yes. Look I think, all the way, all around as you've heard in both Mike's and my prepared remarks, we're really very happy with this quarter on a number of fronts. The billing strength was broad-based. We had billings growth in every region in the world. We had particular strength in North America, but we had strength in all regions. We were very focused on Hosted Unified Communications, which is really, to me, our flagship and bellwether. And it was a mix of some large projects and certainly in the transformational category, but we also recognized revenue out of prior projects. So there was a flow in and out, so I view that as strength, but it was very broad based. And so I think, it wasn't just a big transformation deal that got us there on billings. It was a very consistent solid quarter.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Good. And then on the SIP trunking side, you said Hosted UC drove, how did SIP trunking perform this quarter?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. That was kind of the implication when we didn't really emphasize it, is SIP was down just a little bit Q1 over Q1. And so, that business continues to underperform from our perspective, but the market dynamics continue to seem to be positive; our sell-through data suggests it continues to be positive. And from a competitive standpoint we don't see a lot of competitive headwind, competitive alternative products selling into the carrier. So, our view continues to be that it will be a growth business in 2015.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you very much. I'll cede the floor.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks very much, guys. I wanted to ask about the BroadCloud revenue number this quarter. I think I missed it in your monologue. And I'm also curious about the head-count additions in the business right now, huge quarter this quarter in terms of new additions. Can you talk a little bit more about precisely where you're hiring all those folks in, was it the Leonid deal that contributed there, just where are the big investments right now and why such a big acceleration in head-count adds?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, George. So, a good chunk was actually Leonid. It was round numbers, 30% of that head-count growth. And the rest of the head-count growth really in three primary areas: it's in cloud and cloud operations; it's in professional services around these large projects; and then it's in, broadly speaking, selling power, particularly in some of the sell-through and channel support activities that Michael mentioned in his remarks.
And the revenue for cloud in Q1 was $8.1 million.
George Charles Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty. Your line is now open.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Thanks. Hey. One quick question, Mike. I always thought if you â on the SIP trunking. Do you all really need SIP trunking if you're going to do Unified Communications, right? I didn't think that every time you did UC, you actually needed an SBC. Could you clarify that? And the reason I'm asking it could be one of the reasons why your SIP trunking is down.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think, let me walk through that. Let me dissect it. First of all, I think, on the SIP trunking side from a market perspective, we're still seeing primarily the SIP trunking focus as being North America, Europe slowly starting to pick up.
I think, when people think about SIP trunking, it's often how do you connect premise based or â well, premise-based solutions to the network moving away from traditional TDM interconnects T1s or PRIs. So, one explanation is, people are not -- more stuff is going to the cloud, so there will be less traditional interconnect products. I do think that there is a period of slowness in terms of people migrating in that mid-market; that could be a cause of it. So, it's U.S.-centric only right now. I think we will see growth internationally.
I think the other thing that I want to say around SIP trunking is that we often see SIP trunking in hybrid scenarios where you have some UC and some legacy PBXs. So again, that's more of a mid-market play that's starting to pick up. So, those are some of the dynamics that are going on with SIP trunking.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, is there any way you could give us color between Tier 2 and Tier 1 as far as sell-through? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's specific on SIP trunking or generally?
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
No. Specific on UC. How strong was like a WindStream, CenturyLink versus a Verizon, AT&T, Tier 1, Tier 2?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, it's interesting, Catharine. As I mentioned earlier in the call the performance for the company was really quite broad based. And so, when you look at the billings growth across size of customer, and that's actually probably the most consistent it's ever been in a quarter, certainly more than I remember, they were very in line.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks. I'll cede. Bye-bye.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity pipeline for these transformational deals, obviously without getting into when specifically you'd expect to sign one or more, just if you could give us a sense of where you are in that pipeline in over the next couple of years, do you see replicating the rough like you call it five deals you have now, just what that opportunity looks like? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think, it'd be useful. I think a lot of the transformation projects, not surprisingly, are actually with existing customers that are, let's say, UC centric for now, very focused on launching a new service using our technology. And then, as they look at collapsing their legacy networks and reducing cost and complexity, have come to us and started to look at how we could help them with those transformation. So, I think, generally we're often already engaged â I would say, almost all the time, already engaged with those customers. We are already active in a project or two, primarily in the UC sector, and we'll then be asked to look at how we can consolidate the rest of their network. And I think the model was quite reproducible around the world. I think, the timing is really driven by kind of operator economics about when they want to shut off the PSTN, for example, maintenance contracts on existing IP platforms, or when those kind of, as Jim called them, first generation IP platforms might be reach their end-of-life or manufacture discontinued. So, there is a whole bunch of variations around the world that will come into play, but I think, the playbook getting in there with a Unified Communications Solution and then kind of helping them transform and reduce cost seems very, very consistent and reproducible around the world.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
And just to get back to my question, do you think there are still a number of these opportunities out there, I mean, how would you characterize that opportunity that's still...?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'd say we're very early in the transformation planning. I think, if you look around the world, look at North America, I'm not trying to size that market, but if you just look at the number of total legacy Class 5 switches, there is still thousands and thousands of them, in fact there's been a very small reduction in Class 5 switching â legacy Class 5 switching in North America. So, we are very early in that complete migration PSTN shutdown process even in one of the most advanced markets in the U.S., take that around the world, I think, we're very early in that process.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks for that, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Jess.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Did I hear that there was a new 10% customer in the quarter?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And was that the same customer as the Voice over Wi-Fi customer?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And is it fair to assume that was a U.S.-based customer or could you provide any thoughts on where they are in their process and how that build will unfold through the course of the year?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, we didn't indentify it geographically, but it is definitely one of these network transformation projects we mentioned.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Is it fair to assume it's a cable operator. It seems like they're doing a lot of work in the Voice over Wi-Fi area?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Again, Jess, we did not identify industry segment or geography.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, it sounds like that project drove a lot of strength in the professional services area. Can you help us understand outside of this customer, what you saw in professional services and maybe how we should be thinking about the trajectory to professional services line beyond the March quarter, looks like it was fairly strong here in Q1?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. There's definitely some revenue recognition in PS lines. You can see with revenue exceeding billings on that revenue line item. And part of it definitely was transformation work in hitting acceptance milestones on some professional services work. I think, we guided to a pretty substantive growth for the year and we believe we're tracking to that. I think it will be pretty ratable with some growth across the year. I mean, PS does move around on us (32:58) a little bit, but I think with delivery of these projects, you're going to continue to see PS being a pretty high growth line item for us.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And, Jim, last one from me, but just on the expense side, do you have any currency benefit? How big of a tailwind is that for you, and to what extent will you use that to maybe accelerate some of the investments that currency is giving you benefit on the cost side internationally?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So yeah, I think of us as being pretty naturally hedged. So, even in our sort of prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about revenue headwinds, but from an earnings standpoint, it's neutral to positive, and so I think we think of it less so from a PS benefit, because I'm not in a position to really forecast where we go from here, but more from just sort of a natural expense ramp standpoint, I think, we wanted to build in some flexibility in investments for the rest of the year. So we're maintaining even with the FX, the top line view for the year, and we added a couple of pennies to the guide on earnings, but we wanted to maintain some operating flexibility.
Jess I. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, guys.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker
Good morning. This is Fahad (34:42) in for Paul. Just a question on any significant VoLTE project wins this quarter. And if you can talk a little bit more about any increasing traction that you're seeing with VoLTE type deployments?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, yes, so we mentioned a transformation win in the quarter in Mike's remarks, and that was a pretty interesting one. Again, all these wins are multimillion contract opportunities. This was outside the United States and it was notable in the breadth and depth of BroadWorks in the transformation, so it was UC. So there is a level of TDM replacement there, SIP trunking, so again an element of TDM replacement there, and VoLTE, both consumer and enterprise. So it's a broad based win, but absolutely having VoLTE as a piece of it.
Unknown Speaker
All right. So just so I am clear, this new win is in addition to the six to eight VoLTE wins that you had announced in the previous quarters or all through the previous quarters?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I'm not sure we've actually formerly announced six to eight, but we have quite a number of VoLTE wins. Some are enterprise only, some are consumer and enterprise.
Unknown Speaker
Okay. Thank you.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.
Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Oh, yes, hi. I just wanted to ask you about the voice over Wi-Fi opportunities you highlighted. Can you just give a little more detail in terms of what you see currently and in the pipeline? Are you talking more about mobile operators or wireline or cable? Some color would be helpful?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Simona. I think we're actually seeing a little bit of both. I think we're seeing mobile operators looking at Wi-Fi as obviously they help on spectrum coverage and in building and basically overall improving their quality. And so, there's a number of those projects. Often we suspect those will be tied with VoLTE rollouts. And so, that's why we, I think as Jim described that, we think all of that falls into these transformational projects where we're either building next-generation mobile infrastructure or we're migrating from legacy to IP. And then, there is a number of let me call loosely OTT players that are looking at how to use Wi-Fi to provide some kind of service, sometimes obviously with mobile backup, et cetera. So there is a whole bunch of I think exploration going on in the marketplace by service providers about how to use voice over Wi-Fi in a variety of things. But I'd say the biggest pipeline would probably be more mobile operators than the OTT side.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Your line is now open.
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Hey, great. Thanks. You mentioned the sell-through is healthy. I think in the past you've talked about 25% growth I believe on UC. Is that still a good ballpark number?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, we didn't get specific in Q1, but continued healthy sell-through absolutely.
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then on the gross margin for professional services, is the number this quarter a good one to use for the year or does that change much?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, I think for the year I actually think you'll see a little bit of compression across the year. This was favorably â basically the math is we book expense in periods. So, if regardless of whether we have to defer it or not, so in quarters where you have more coming off the balance sheet than you bill, you have somewhat unusually strong margins. That business for us I think for the year and long term is much more of a 33% to 36% kind of gross margin. So, I think it's going to be in that range for the year. So I think you'll see a little bit of compression across the year.
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then just last on BroadCloud, I think you had some BroadCloud deals outside of the telco channel in the first quarter. I guess can you just mention maybe how many deals you did have through outside the telco channel for BroadCloud?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm not what sure you mean â outside the telco channel, you mean smaller resellers or if that what you mean, (40:23)?
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Yes, I thought there were maybe some data VARs, those sorts, those sort of things that are selling BroadCloud now?
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right. I think we've announced some additional channels, small channels to BroadCloud, but we haven't given any numbers of how many of those we've signed up.
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Okay.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
I mean, substantively all service providers.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
You get service providers in a lot of different flavors.
Michael Tessler - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right.
Mike Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Yes, all right. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with the Juda Group. Your line is now open.
Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group
Hi, two questions. First, if you could talk about mobility as a percent of revenues, if there is a way for us to think about as a percent of revenues and billings, what's that starting to represent. I know you have several VoLTE wins. What those numbers are getting to?
The other question is just in terms of billings. Given some of these deals you're seeing, can you talk a little bit about duration of billings? What has happened to the duration of billings, and right now your billings growth rate obviously is much stronger than the revenue growth guidance. Typically, when should we start to see that converge a little bit more based on how it's played out in the past?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. I don't have a percentage for you on mobile because it's so â even thinking about wireline versus wireless anymore is a very hard distinction. We so power the world's converged carriers and those are really converged offerings and even VoLTE implementations have elements of transforming business pots to that carrier's business VoLTE solution. So that's a hard one. Clearly mobility as part of our packaging to carriers and part of their go-to market is increasingly important in the mix. So it's vital across our customer base, but it's very hard to carve out a mobility percentage.
And in terms of the billings duration, two things I think in overall billings, probably three things, one, that we effectively were flat Q1 over Q4, which is really a great thing for Q1; two, that there was substantive growth on the software side; and three that there was just, as we said, a really nice mix across all the billings, and I'm sorry, three is, that there was growth in the long-term, i.e. more than 12 months.
So, I think that we like to see billing as a real indicator for sales in the marketplace, especially on the software side, but quite a number of those we expect to be in 2016. As we alluded to on the software side, there's a fair number of these network transformation deals are 2016 deals. So, it is a mix obviously in the current and the long-term. And I think long-term you see alignment in the growth rates between billings and revenue because it all gets recognized at some point.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
A quick follow-up gentlemen. Can you give us a split of consumer hosted and SIP trunking in the quarter? And then, Jim, on this voice over Wi-Fi, do you consider that a consumer project? And if so, do you expect consumer split, so consumer percentage revenue to increase throughout the year?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So let me do the second, first. There's elements on voice over Wi-Fi that are both consumer and business. And I think we'll continue to see that. I think consumer will be up over last year; it actually was Q1 over Q1. I'm not sure it's going to increase as a percentage of revenue for the year. Hosted has grown pretty quickly. The consumer continues to be in the 5% discount for us. Trunking is actually down to the 15 percentage range and the rest is hosted UC.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. Keep up the good work.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker
This is Fahad (46:35) again for Paul. I'm not sure if I missed this. But have you given us the geographic revenue breakdown by region.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
I'm not sure we have. As a growth rate or percentage?
Unknown Speaker
Percentage.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So I just said, North America was about $30 million, Europe was about $15 million and Rest of World was the rest.
Unknown Speaker
Okay. Thank you.
