Welcome to the Markit Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is John and Iâll be your operator for todayâs call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note the conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Matthew Kolby.
Matthew Kolby
Thank you, John. Welcome to Markitâs earnings conference call to discuss our third quarter results for 2015. With me today in New York is Lance Uggla, Founder and CEO; and Jeff Gooch, our CFO.
As usual, Lance will begin by walking through some key highlights during the quarter and then Jeff will cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open up the call for Q&A. As a reminder, the call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the IR section of the Markit Web site. The press release and supporting documents can also be found on our Web site.
Before we get started, Iâd like to remind you that this call may include certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed by our comments today. Information about the factors that can affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F.
This call may also include certain forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
And now, Iâll turn it over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Thanks, Matt. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us on todayâs third quarter call. I want to discuss three things with you today. First, I want to update you on our third quarter financial results. Secondly, I want to highlight some key developments that demonstrate the progress we are making with our long-term strategy. And lastly, Iâd like to talk briefly about acquisitions.
Letâs get started with the quarter on Page 5 of the deck. Okay. In Q3, we grew revenues on a constant currency basis by 6%. Information and Solutions both saw strong organic growth of 5% and 13% for the quarter, which was further enhanced with acquisitions in the Solutions division.
Processing, as weâve previously discussed, continued to see a shift to electronic trading and clearing, price cuts in derivative processing coupled with lower volumes overall in the primarily loan market reduced processing organic revenues year-on-year by 14%.
Overall, Iâm very pleased with the organic growth achieved in both the Information and Solutions divisions and Iâm equally pleased with our continued management of expenses which is allowing us to deliver strong margins.
Let me now take a moment to talk about a couple of recent product developments. This quarter, we continued to innovate and launched new products and enhancements across the firm that will generate future organic growth for us.
There are many examples but thereâs two Iâd like to highlight. First, we recently launched WSO Credit Manager for the loan market. This product embeds our extensive credit pricing datasets on to a platform that gives the portfolio manager and credit analysts the tools they need to streamline the credit selection process.
Also this quarter, we launched KY3P, which stands for Know Your Third Party. Weâre very excited about this new product that we built in partnership with our customers and will help them better manage the on-boarding and compliance of their vendors and third-party suppliers as well as allowing them to lower cost and reduce risks, particularly with regard to the notification of cyber security events. KY3P like KYC will have a period of about 12 to 24 months growing and developing as it heads towards profitability in the second half of 2017.
Now let me talk for a moment about people. This quarter, Yaacov Mutnikas and Rob Flatley both joined my executive team. Let me tell you a little bit about Yaacov first. Not only does he hold the world record for rowing the Atlantic but Yaacov also has a wealth of buy-side and sell-side experience in software and analytics with roles at the Bank of England, Bridgewater and as CTO and Head of Products at Algorithmics. Yaacov will co-head solutions with Michele Trogni focusing on enterprise software while Michele continues to focus on managed services.
Now Rob Flatley, he joined us through the recent acquisition of CoreOne Technologies where he was the CEO and he brings a depth of equitiesâ experience to our team. Rob will head equities products globally reporting to me. Both Yaacov and Rob are great additions to our team and are already making a positive contribution to the firm.
Finally, let me talk about acquisitions. Weâve announced four new acquisitions this year; Halifax House Price Index at the beginning of the year, Information Mosaic, CoreOne Technologies and since our last earnings call, DealHub.
We closed DealHub in early September and it is highly complementary to our FX processing business allowing us to offer a comprehensive solution for FX including venue and clearing connectivity, trade confirmation, trade management and regulatory reporting. DealHub will make it easier for our customers to transact and will fuel long-term growth in the Processing division.
Each of these deals are classic Markit acquisitions given their strategic fit with our existing businesses. Itâs too early to measure the return profile but as you know we are highly focused on achieving our targeted return on investment capital, and we expect each of these acquisitions to produce a return in excess of our weighted average cost to capital.
To demonstrate our strong capital allocation performance related to acquisitions, Iâd like to review the acquisitions we made in the three-year period prior to this year. During that period, we made six acquisitions investing a total of around 850 million. In aggregate, these businesses today are producing a return on invested capital in excess of our cost to capital.
Each of them has helped build out our offering and produced strategic benefit and financial results in line with our expectations. We will maintain our disciplined approach to acquisitions and will only execute where we can meet or exceed our return on invested capital target within a reasonable timeframe.
Now before I handover to Jeff, Iâd like to mention our agreement to settle the antitrust class action lawsuit relating to CDS that we and a number of firms have been parties to. Our final settlement agreement was provisionally approved by the court at the end of October and is 45 million. They finally approved it will have no material effect on our financial condition or our liquidity.
We continue to believe that we acted properly at all times just given the time and legal cost involved in protracted litigation as well as the overhang we ultimately decided that settling the matter was in the best interest of our company and our shareholders.
Overall, in Q3, Iâm pleased that we continue to make excellent progress in delivering our long-term growth strategy. We have established deeper relationships with our customers, attracting great new people, launched new products and made important acquisitions, all of which will fuel growth in 2016 and the years ahead.
Iâll now handover to Jeff who will take you through our financial performance in greater detail.
Jeff Gooch
Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. As usual, Iâll start by walking you through a summary of the Q3 financial results on Slide 7. Revenue grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis or 2.8% on a reported basis, including the negative impact of foreign exchange movements.
Adjusted EBITDA was $124 million and margins decreased year-over-year to 44.9% primarily due to reduced revenue in the Processing segment. Adjusted earnings were $68 million with Q3 diluted adjusted earnings per share of $0.37 in line with the prior year. Diluted share count decreased 1.3% largely as the result of our previously announced share repurchase in Q2.
Turning to Slide 8. Organic revenue growth in Q3 was 2.3%, which brings us to 4.5% for the nine months. Both Information and Solutions continue to perform well while Processing showed an expected organic revenue decline as a result of the price changes implemented in Q2 but also due to lower primary issuance volumes in the leverage loan market.
Acquisition-related revenue growth was 3.3% for the quarter, driven by thinkFolio and CTI Tax Solutions which were acquired in 2014 and more significantly by our most recent acquisitions Information Mosaic and DealHub respectively acquired in July and September of this year.
The acquisition of CoreOne announced in our Q2 earnings call closed on October 1, 2015 and is therefore not included in our financial results for this quarter. FX movements adversely affected the quarter reducing revenue growth by 2.8% primarily due to the strength in U.S. dollar against both sterling and the euro.
As you can see on Slide 9, we have approximately 94% recurring revenues. Focusing on fixed recurring revenues, you can see these increased as reported in our revenue base from 54% to 57%. The increase year-over-year of 10% or $15 million was attributable primarily to new business wins across Information and Solutions.
Conversely, variable recurring revenues fell to 36% largely due to lower revenue in Processing year-over-year. We expect the fixed recurring proportion of our revenue to increase further in Q4 due to the acquisitions of DealHub and CoreOne. Renewal rates on fixed recurring contracts continue to be strong at approximately 90% for the quarter.
Now let's look at our operating expenses on Slide 10. Q3 operating expenses increased by $7 million or 5% compared to the prior year. This increase was due to acquisitions, new product development, revenue royalties and SOX implementation costs was partially mitigated by movements in foreign exchange. As Lance mentioned, we incurred an exceptional item this quarter of $45 million related to our settlement of the U.S. antitrust class action lawsuit.
Letâs move on to talk about the performance of operating segments in more detail, starting with Information on Slide 11. Organic growth was 5.1% driven by solid growth across fixed income pricing and reference data and indices. We continue to see demand for data to manage risk and the regulatory requirements. Low pricing, in particular, continued to show strong double-digit growth as we continue to win business from competitors. Low pricing also showed high single-digit growth driven by expansion of the existing customer portfolios and new entrants in the asset class.
The continued trend towards more passive investments in fixed income drove double-digit growth in our indices business. We saw inflows into ETF assets under management tied to our iBoxx indices at $84 billion. Overall bonding mix revenue grew by 30% year-on-year on a constant currency basis.
We also saw good growth in our PMI franchise as a result of the new sponsorship agreements we had mentioned on last quarterâs call. Our valuation and trading service sub-segment was largely flat year-over-year, however, we were pleased to see a strong quarter from portfolio valuations combined by higher trade volumes from existing customers and increased business from fund administrators.
When we look at Q4, the acquisition of CoreOne closed on October 1, that will be included in the financial results. And to help you model this, CoreOne has approximately $50 million of revenue at the time we closed the deal and will be split evenly between Information and Solutions. Products will be included in Information and the regulatory reporting solution in RegOne and the index ETP management product, DeltaOne. We expect EBITDA margins from these combined products to be broadly in line with the Information division average.
Turning now to Processing on Slide 12. Reported revenue in Processing decreased 15.1% with organic revenue declining 13.6% compared to a very strong third quarter in 2104. Breaking down these results in more detail, we saw strong underlying rates of processing volumes with low double-digit growth. However, this was offset by the price changes in Q2 and adverse foreign exchange rate movements, which meant we saw an overall revenue decline year-over-year. In credit derivatives, we continue to see weaker volumes compared to last year as the market continues to consolidate.
In loan processing, we saw strong secondary volumes at a similar level to last year, however, the primary loan volumes meant we were down overall in loan revenues. We do anticipate the primaryâs market will pick up in Q4, however, we remain bullish on the asset class over the longer term.
As Lance mentioned, we closed the acquisition DealHub in September 2015. At the time of acquisition, DealHub was generating approximately $12 million in annual revenue and we expect it run at mid-30s EBITDA margins. This will accelerate growth in our FX offering and increase the importance of the FX franchise within Processing.
The processing teamâs continued focus on cost resulted in Q3 adjusted EBITDA margins of 51.2% despite the revenue decline. Looking ahead to Q4, Iâd like to point out the fourth quarter of 2014 included one-off revenue of $6 million related to an industry protocol change in the credit markets.
Turning now to our Solutions segment on Slide 13. Q3 reported revenue increased by 21.3% or 13.1% from an organic basis. We continued to see good growth across our largest managed services products, including both On Demand and WSO. On Demand customers in wealth management are increasingly looking to us to provide an enhanced user experience and tools for their clients.
Looking at WSO, customers generally continue to grow assets under management. Weâve also extended the reach of our agency platform to more mid-tier players as regulatory pressures have impacted Tier 1 banks. Growth in enterprise software was driven by new business wins in EDM where we see an increasing demand for both hosted and managed solutions as well as new customers seeking broader used cases.
In terms of acquisitions, thinkFolio, Tax Solutions and Information Mosaic contributed growth 10.7% overall and continue to perform well. In Q3, Information Mosaic contributed $5 million to acquired growth. Going forward, we expect it run at segment level EBITDA margins. This business complements our existing Corporate Actions product, which continues to grow strongly since acquisition in 2013 with our revenue CAGR since then of 14%.
Overall, adjusted EBITDA increased by 26.1% to $30 million and margins this quarter were up from Q2 to 33.8%. Year-to-date margins of 32.9%, as mentioned last quarter, we anticipate continuing to run the segment margins at this level whilst we invest in new initiatives such as KYC and KY3P. Looking ahead to Q4, Solutions organic growth rates will be negatively impacted by the first time record addition of KYC revenue in Q4 2014 comparative.
Also in Q4, CoreOne products will be included in Solutions for the first time. These products have a data management solution VistaOne and a prime brokerage platform PrimeOne. We expect EBITDA margins from these combined products be broadly in line with the Solutions division average.
Looking now at Slide 14 on net debt and leverage. Acquisition considerations during Q3 resulted in cash outflow of $100 million related to Information Mosaic and DealHub. Iâd just like to add two other points with our capital management strategy. Firstly, it is still our intention to utilize the remaining $150 million for share repurchase utilization. We expect to do this by year-end subject to market conditions.
Secondly, you will see in our 6-K filings last week that we finalized arrangements for our U.S. private placement to secure $500 million of additional debt capacity with a mix of 7 and 10-year tenures. This will protect earnings from future interest rate rises and give market additional capacity and flexibility.
Lastly, before we open up for Q&A, Iâd like to give you an update on the change regarding our presentation of the quiet revenue growth. Starting next year, to align with our peers, we will treat revenue from new acquisitions as acquired for the first 12 months only. Given the timing of our recent acquisitions, we will have no impact in our results until Q3 2016 that should give ample and plenty of time to update their models. Overall, despite the challenges in the loan market, this was a positive third quarter results and I am remain confident in the long-term trends of the business.
Iâd now like to hand the call back over to Lance.
Lance Uggla
Thanks, Jeff. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, weâd like to now open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Iâll begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik
Thank you. Good morning, guys. Lance, first question for you is just around the M&A pipeline, just trying to understand how big that pipeline is, like what we should expect over the next year or so. And also if you could address in the context of that pipeline some of the larger deals and maybe the one that was done recently that you see that as any big competitive change in the marketplace?
Lance Uggla
Okay. Thanks, Manav. I guess the focus at the moment is integrating the recent deals to broaden the future organic growth. So that would be number one on my management teamâs list in terms of short-term priority. The pipelineâs strong and as Iâve said over the last few quarters, probably is strong as weâve seen it with a lot of very good opportunities across our three segments, and thatâs the second thing Iâd say thatâs important to note. The third thing Iâd like to say is that when we look at bolt-on acquisitions, weâre looking for those acquisitions that combine well with current market assets, can be integrated very well and then together we can grow the acquired assets better than it was growing on its own and we can develop new organic growth between the acquisition and existing market products. So that strategy is very strong, very disciplined. Today, I wanted to give some background on how we look at ROIC and that we remain very disciplined. On your second part of the question, which refers to larger acquisitions that we were strongly rumored to be involved in and Iâll leave it at that. It did trade â IDC did trade to ICE. What I would say to you in all aspects, if weâre going to look at any asset whether small or large and we will analyze most assets that come through the financial state, we see it as part of our D&A and itâs very important for us to understand all parts of our landscape. So weâll look at all assets. But we have to take a very disciplined approach. Youâve got employee, shareholders and the shareholders that have invested in our company and for us, we will keep ROIC at the very front of our agenda in terms of making any decisions. And with respect to that particular transaction at the prices that traded, it would not have met our hurdles.
Manav Patnaik
All right, fair enough. And then just for you, Jeff, real quick. I think weâve gotten better on the processing side in terms of at least tracking the primary loan issuance and so forth as it relates to you guys. Can you help us give some sense of the other categories, what the outlook there looks like in terms of volume, if there are any particular, I donât know, regulation or events that potentially move those around a lot that we should know?
Jeff Gooch
No. As you know, there has been a number of regulations impacting the primary market. Itâs hard to know exactly what impact each of them have and the primary marketâs been somewhat slowed last quarter and had a good Q2. It was a quiet Q1 as well. Secondary loan markets, volumes have been very strong and it was up a lot last year, and it remained equally strong this year. So I think we feel very good about that trend. I think even the derivative asset cost is â I donât see regulation changing or anything over the next 12 months or so. Weâre not really expecting electronic trading in Europe until 2017. The big unknown is when is the Fed going to move on rates. It would be good if Janet Yellen had moved things a few months ago, we would have loved the volatility that would have created. At some point, rates will probably start to move up. So if I look at the interest rate market, we still saw double-digit growth despite that lack of a rate increase, which weâre very pleased about, because of an upside in terms of underlying volumes. So clearly electronic trading and currency [indiscernible] back a little bit. Credit markets are very subdued and continue to contract. So as I said, these are certainly two big trends. Equity markets have been very volatile as you know this year up and down, same thing with derivatives. So I would say the big trends are good underlying growth in rates with an upside expected if we see some more volatility. Credit market continues to decline though, probably will bottom out at some point. In the loan market, we have strong FX, strong secondary volumes, primary subdued at the moment. And then the FX asset class, weâre not really exposed to volumes. Most of our business there is subscription, so thatâs a little less an issue for us.
Manav Patnaik
Okay. Thanks a lot guys, really helpful.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio
Hi. Jeff, a couple for you. If we look at the Processing division, can you maybe just break out the price decreases versus maybe the tougher comps and loan origination? And then second, you had called out that KY3P is going to be â youâll be investing in it until the second half of '17 but thatâs already included in your roughly 33% EBITDA margin, is that correct? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
Yes, thank you for those entirely. So in terms of the impact of pricing changes very similar to last quarter, we think about $5 million total impact from both price changes and a general move to electronic trading and same-day clearings. So there is no acceleration of that trend. The other movements really underlying volume movements. And then in terms of KY3P, yes, weâve been investing that product over the last 12 months or so. Thatâs been in our numbers, as you say already, Paul. That will ramp up slightly as we launch the product in terms of sales coverage and other things, but thatâs largely already in our run rate.
Paul Ginocchio
Great. Thank you.
Operator
We have a question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan
Hi. Good morning. Can you just give us a sense a little bit more on Processing? I think you said youâre hoping that the primary loan issuance gets better in 4Q but just wondering if you could give us similar color on your expectations for next quarter? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
Okay. So I donât expect Q4 primary volume to pick up not through the quarter yet, but my expectation will be looking at [indiscernible]. We wonât see any material uptick in volumes in Q4 for primaries. Longer term, we still remain pretty bullish on that asset class but not for this quarter.
Toni Kaplan
Okay. Sorry, I think I misheard but thank you for clarifying. Okay. And then separately, you mentioned the $45 million antitrust CDS settlement and then in the press release you noted the ongoing investigations by the Department of Justice and the European Commission. So I just wanted to know if you could give us an update on sort of the scope of whatâs left in terms of your exposure there? Thanks.
Jeff Gooch
Yes. Nothingâs really changed. In terms of the Department of Justice, weâve had no contact since 2012. So officially the case is open but as far as weâre aware, no oneâs working on it. In terms of the EU case, thereâs still a team working on that. Weâre still waiting to hear back in terms of whether they intend to continue with it. That situation has been the same now for almost a year, so weâre still waiting for news.
Toni Kaplan
Thanks a lot.
Operator
We have a question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin
Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little more insight into the KYC partnership, how skilled that is today in terms of the revenue itâs generating and how youâre thinking about the path, scale and profitability there?
Lance Uggla
Okay. Itâs Lance, Iâll take that one. So KYC is I think Iâve said each quarter really itâs a set of signals in terms of momentum that I think are important in terms of the competitive landscape for the client on-boarding initiatives of ourselves, Clariant and Thomson Reuters. So we continue to gain momentum. Some updated facts; we have 10 banks implementing this service, 10 of the 14 largest banks in the world. I think thatâs a very strong signal of support for our platform. So thatâs important because each of the banks that we add are going through a competitive process to select a platform or even two platforms that they want to participate on. So I think thatâs a really strong sign for us. The second thing, we now have 1,500 firms registered with the service. Thatâs only five sides [ph]. Another growth from maybe the last time I updated was we were just breaking 1,000. I think the third thing thatâs given us a competitive edge is tax and we already have a leading tax utility around FATCA but regulations around the world â the new regulation is called CRS, which are common reporting standards. These are some 90 governments around the world that are looking to do a FATCA-like â look at their individuals investments abroad and ensure that any tax available to be brought back home â to the homeland is made available. These standards need to be reported for several of those 90 countries early next year and the rest of them following. So thatâs very important for our KYC progress because weâre very well positioned of our FATCA position to be the leading provider of CRS due diligence and reporting. Weâre tying that together, itâs given us good momentum. I believe we maintain a leadership position in KYC and weâll continue to do so as we move into next year. I donât know Jeff if you want to give any comment on the expenses that are all in the Solutions divisionâs numbers and are being realized on a regular basis.
Jeff Gooch
Yes, just to remind everybody because we equity account for the joint venture, that means we donât do the normal intercompany clear out of a trade. So we have to show is revenue or cost of any services we provide to the joint venture, which go through Solutions. And then we take back the loss from the joint venture back into the numbers. So one of the comments I made in my remarks regarding Q4, from Q4 last year we set up that joint venture company and did a slight catch up. We caught up about five months of expenses, which were booked in Q4 last year. That will affect the comparative next quarter, so it will have that five-month versus a three-month comparative that will show negative trends or positive trends for that low quarter. I just wanted to flag that. But overall, whilst itâs still a negative drain of EBITDA level, the losses are reducing on that business as we start to scale out, which is very encouraging to see. Iâve talked to Jon May. I keep reminding him weâre set to breakeven by the end of next year, weâll see if we get there but it certainly is going to be a continued investment program through most of '16.
Andre Benjamin
And then I apologize it, I feel like on CoreOne you said itâs at a 50 million run rate now but I donât know if you said either what itâs growing out or how we should model the growth in that asset going forward?
Jeff Gooch
We didnât give any guidance on that. What I can say was its 50% in Information, 50% in Solutions and broadly speaking both those two parts conveniently are roughly the average margins of those two divisions. So it should move divisional margins on all line of cost.
Andre Benjamin
Okay.
Operator
Our next question is from Vincent Hung from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Vincent Hung
Yes, itâs Autonomous actually. Hi. Good morning.
Lance Uggla
Hi, Vincent.
Vincent Hung
So I just want to talk about KY3P again now that youâve launched it. Are you guys the first to move in there or are other firms more advanced? And how important are partnerships in that business compared with KYC where youâve got some decent partnerships with the G14 dealers?
Lance Uggla
Yes, so I think partnerships are very valuable in both KYC and KY3P because they â youâre really building a process that is built on the knowledge and processes that most partners are already engaging in. And so they understand the challenges of complying in both client on boarding as well as in vendor compliance and management. So the partnerships are very important. In KY3P, we partnered upfront with Barclays, HSBC and Morgan Stanley and theyâve been working with us for about a year to create the service. Dell was our first big corporate customer as well as a vendor that industry participants need to do vendor compliance on. So, it was a great first corporate customer. Weâve subsequently had added another six or seven customers post Dell and we havenât made any announcements on those I believe as of yet. So whatâs nice about this utility is it can span across multiple industries but the banks are big because of the regulatory presence that the banks find themselves in. They need to ensure vendor compliance takes place in a very efficient manner. And they have very detailed processes that are very similar to each other. Some banks have north of 50,000 vendors that they need to do compliance on. Now you have to think about the vendors in the financial market, vendors like Markit. Weâre also vendors supplying to funds. So the funds need to do compliance. So when you start to look at the whole ecosystem, itâs asset managers, itâs hedge funds, itâs insurance companies, itâs banks. And then all the vendors that participate â and even as a vendor, weâre expected to do compliance on the people that we rely on. So this ecosystem we see is very large and the banks are great partners for us to build out this service with. And the partnership Morgan Stanley and HSBC are also partners of us in KYC and Barclays was not in the KYC consortium that we put together but are a partner in KY3P. So I think this is really important. Itâs a big opportunity. It is a game changer. We have first mover advantage and overall the platform fits right into the managed service environment where weâre looking for cost reduction, reduction of risks and realization of efficiencies. So I think this like KYC is a big opportunity for us and weâve got momentum. I believe weâre in front in KYC and we havenât seen our first competitor yet show up on KY3P.
Vincent Hung
Okay. Just a follow up on the economics. Unlike KYC where you said before that the top 10 banks spent $1 billion. Am I right in thinking this is incremental spend for the bank because theyâre probably not paying people to do this right now. And in terms of how you get paid, is it similar to KYC where the bank will pay to on board each vendor?
Lance Uggla
Yes. So you should think about it â so let me take Markit for an example. So Markit has â as we get asked to comply to requests from our counterparties. So if a bank, an insurance company, a large fund manager wants us to comply with respect to their vendor compliance, both the person asking for the information as well as us having to provide the information have to staff up accordingly to provide that information to the numerous requests that we get. And the requests are very extensive. So this is a platform thatâs built with a standardized set of information passing from vendor to requestor on a platform. So it allows the vendor to reduce staff and the vendor is willing to pay to put information in a standardized way onto a platform to be retrieved on a permission basis as well as the institutions asking gain benefit in terms of staffing and efficiencies by being able to take from that platform. So it really is a great way of both sides benefitting from efficiencies in terms of what the platform can provide. And we built this out as a privately managed cloud-based service and we see this as being able to be leveraged across the industry very easily.
Vincent Hung
Okay. Thanks. And lastly, can you just give us some color around the growth in On Demand, WSO and EDM? What is driving customer demand there? Is it just secular or was there anything very specific in each of those businesses?
Lance Uggla
Okay. Well, Markit On Demand is delivering mobile devices, device upgrades, Web sites and all the â both Android and Apple tools that are financial market participants that the customer â one of our customers wants to have to stay ahead of the pack. So those tools âthe communications that we have with the companies we deal with, so if youâre a customer of an online broker you want to have the best portfolio tools, you want to have the best alerting tools, the best graph, the best personalization of your experience. And all of those are constantly being updated based on whatâs available in the marketplace. So if you look at the online brokers, theyâre constantly refreshing their offering to their clients to stay ahead of the pack. So thatâs one place that we get growth is our current customers refreshing their sites and looking for ways to gain competitive edge in terms of screening tools, learning tools, personalization, et cetera. The second growth area for us is the wealth management platforms. Most of the wealth management platforms were built in-house. But when you look at the online brokers and the tools that they have and the customer experience they have, the wealth mangers want something similar. That would be the second area of growth for Markit On Demand. And then the third area of growth is personalizing and improving the look and feel and delivery of client reporting. And client reporting then moves into the asset managers who are providing reporting interfaces to their customers, so it might be insurance companies, pension funds, et cetera, who are looking for a better experience when theyâre looking at changes to their portfolio online and historically these have been very old, outdated systems. And having a client reporting portal can be a competitive edge, so weâre seeing growth there. So those would be the three growth areas in Markit On Demand. EDM growth areas are â we only have 150 customers out of hundreds of customers globally, so cross-sell and customer growth but also applying data management tools for new uses. So this year we bought our first commodity customer. So we used the data platform, extended the used case into commodities and we now have a pipeline of customers in the commodity space. So the second part of growth is new uses for the data management tools. Now the third growth is moving to a hosted managed service and those three will be driving EDM. And I think the last one --
Jeff Gooch
thinkFolio is the other one.
Lance Uggla
Right. And thinkFolio again itâs just â we have about 45 to 50 customers, so itâs really growth, very UK-centric when we acquired it. Weâve now staffed up and are focusing on our global client base and cross-sell into that and weâve seen good wins this year in North America 
Vincent Hung
Thatâs great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm
Hi. Good morning, everyone. First, want to talk about pricing a little bit. I donât think it was talked about much. I think historically, you have talked about not really taking much pricing in your existing product and are more focused on cross selling. But I think more recently, youâve opened the door to maybe built-in CPI in GO contracts a little bit. So maybe you can give us a little bit more detail in terms of where you think pricing power can go and what segments in particular and then timing in terms of any sort of big contract re-pricing that we should be thinking about over the next 12 or 18 months.
Jeff Gooch
Yes, sure. I think the pattern over the last couple of years has been for our pricing mix to be largely neutral. Weâve increased prices CPI in certain products, weâve reduced prices in others and I would say overall the impacts in our growth has been fairly negligible. I think as you look forward, I think weâre looking more carefully at pricing. I donât think pricing will be a big driver of growth in 2016. I think we are trying to put more CPI into more contracts, certainly in the software businesses thatâs much more standard. Having said that, CPI is a pretty low number at the moment. It doesnât really make much difference. So weâre certainly looking at pricing opportunities, itâs something weâll look to lever over time. But as of 2016, I donât really see that as adding any material amounts to our growth rate.
Alex Kramm
Okay, fair enough. And then secondly, a little bit bigger picture. I went to an industry conference last week and one of the big topics was blockchain and you might have been asked this before, but Iâm going to ask again. And I think industry participants are particularly looking for gaining efficiencies around clearing, settlement and things like that, which is in the Processing business is kind of just in the middle of that. So in particular, some folks were highlighting the loans business and how blockchain could really bring down those settlement times, which are obviously very long. So as you think about blockchain and innovation in that regard, do you see this as a friend? Are you investing there? Are you trying to make your offerings better using some new technologies or you think this could be a big headwind if some of these new innovations are becoming basically â make some of your products non-valuable anymore? Thanks.
Lance Uggla
Okay. So I guess not a week goes by where blockchain doesnât hit my agenda these days and if many different companies trade block, Digital Asset Holdings, [indiscernible] R3. Thereâs many examples where weâre engaged with discussions around the use of a distributed ledger to enhance processing and settlement times. So to me, given our position in the loan space, I think the use of blockchain technology in the future can be a real friend to us. And it really is taking and using that database technology starting with the agent banks improving the delivery of information on new technology through to the customer base of WSO, which is connected through Markit Clear. And so we see this as a real positive innovation and one that between the agent banks and ourselves will prove an opportunity to reduce costs and leverage that new technology. So we do have teams under Brad Levy that are focused on it. We have our own in-house experts that are focused and weâre working with key providers that we think could be helpful developers of this technology with respect to the loan space. So thatâs the first base and we have a big position there and we think the technology is enhancing. We also need to keep an eye on the technology with respect to derivative processing, credit and rates and there we have some, 1,500 buy-side globally that are leveraging and utilizing our pipes. And if thereâs ways to improve and utilize new technology, we need to be aware of it. And again, the same team under Brad is very focused. We have environment setup ourselves to test the technology and we have lots of discussions with participants in the marketplace to understand how theyâre approaching and how it might be beneficial to the market and to us in particular. So, yes, weâre very focused. With respect to loans, we see it as a friend.
Alex Kramm
Excellent.
Jeff Gooch
Iâll add one thing to that. Iâd say generally anything that can make markets more cost efficient and more frictionless, will increase trading, blockchain I see that very friendly to our businesses. So weâre very supportive of anything that can make it cheaper to do a transaction.
Alex Kramm
All right, very helpful. Thank you.

You have a question from Sara Gubins from Bank of America
Sara Gubins
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Within Processing on margins, are we at a full run rate in terms of cost savings or is there more to come? And could you talk to us about what youâre doing to lower costs?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, I think weâre going through a program of a number of things; moving staff to lower cost locations, being more efficient in terms of staffing levels themselves, looking at the way we apply technology. Weâve been very focused on delivering technologies to help our customers meet regulatory requirements without applying some of that technology to help us reduce our internal costs. So thatâs helped us bring down the cost base. Brad and the team still have more to do, so we donât view ourselves as being done. I think we mentioned on the last quarterly call or if itâs the one before, I think itâs the last one that we had the headwind from electronic trading but we still think on average through that cycle we can maintain a 50% margin. You saw this quarter, despite some tough volume numbers, we still hit 51%. There will be a little bit more headwinds come in '17 but it also has more cost reduction we can work on just between now and then. So, weâre not knocked down yet.
Sara Gubins
Okay, great. So probably margins drop in '16 in Processing and then begin to improve, is that fair?
Jeff Gooch
It depends on the timing. Weâre probably not â weâre expecting less of a revenue headwind in '16 on some derivative side of things. So my guess is you will probably see reasonably strong margins through '16 and then the rest of the headwind will hit in '17. So we need to be ready for that in terms of cost reductions. Itâs hard to look at the timing. We had a slight problem, if you remember, in '14 when we got some of that cost reductions ahead of the price changes and our margins popped up 56%, 57%, which wasnât intentional. But we may see slight ups and downs. I mean some low volume quarters will probably be like 50%, some will be above as well. We certainly expect some volatility but 50% is still average.
Sara Gubins
Okay, great. And then I know you donât provide guidance, but could you give us some high-level color on how youâre thinking about the three segments over the course of the next year or so?
Lance Uggla
Yes. So we have our guidance that weâre very comfortable with on a go-forward basis. So the 5% to 7% organic growth, thatâs something that we reconfirm regularly. If you look back to last three years, we were right in the middle of it twice, above it nicely once and looks like weâre on the lower cusp of it or just outside this year. As we look forward next year, we feel very comfortable with the 5% to 7% as our guidance and we start to plan for next year. Weâre also comfortable with our margins performance and weâll continue to give that guidance. And then finally, acquired growth, we have made several acquisitions this year, so those will start to roll into the numbers. And our guidance of double digits for acquisitions is clearly strongly in place for next year.
Sara Gubins
Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.
Gunnar Hansen
Hi, guys. This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary Bisbee. I just have a question on the Processing. You guys have previously said about 20 million impact to the electronic trading for this year and 30 million, 35 million for 2017 as Europe rolls over. Are those numbers still a good number to use?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, thatâs about that estimate that Europe is still finalizing dates and things since Q2, so weâll wait and see, but thatâs our current view.
Gunnar Hansen
Okay, fair enough. And I guess just in terms of â you guys have in the past given some updates geographically. Anything you guys want to comment on or highlight particularly in Asia or Europe that have seen some strength or anything of that nature?
Jeff Gooch
I think the trend is probably, we mentioned a couple of quarters ago, the European market remains relatively weaker, not surprising. U.S. has been a bit more bullish. I think Asia is doing very well. Weâve seen increased growth out there. I think weâre very pleased with the progress in the number of markets out in Asia Pacific; so nothing really to change there in terms of the feedback we gave previously. And also Iâll just pick up one thing. We like to talk about our long-term objectives and we answered the previous question, I think you used the word guidance, which is [indiscernible]. But those objectives are our long-term financial objectives that we look to meet over a number of years. We have a pretty good track record of being in the range, as Lance just said, but I think certainly I believe the next year that that will change for this comment.
Gunnar Hansen
Okay, fair enough. And I guess on that topic of long-term targets, in terms of leverage targeted, have you guys still 1.5, 2 times leverage, is that still the base case?
Jeff Gooch
Yes, I think our core proposition is to be in that 1.5 to 2 times range and then weâll spike above with acquisitions. At the moment, obviously weâre still well below, so [indiscernible] back below. We took the $500 million worth of debt of last week. That gives us between revolving credit facility and the private placements three turns of leverage in place, so we can now go up to three without having to arrange additional financing. So, I think that gives us the capital structure we wanted that we said previously. So weâd still view ourselves as slightly under-levered at the moment and look for opportunities to improve that. The 150 million buyback will help. As Lance said, the acquisition pipeline is still robust and weâll kind of work on those things through into next year.
Gunnar Hansen
Great. Thanks.
Lance Uggla
Okay. I think thatâs all the questions we have in the queue, so thank you to everybody for joining today and we will see you again next quarter. Thank you. Bye.
