Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Catherine and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2011 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakersâ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Greg Klaben. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Greg Klaben
Thanks, Catherine. Joining me today to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2011 financial results are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics President and CEO; and Barbara Scherer, Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and CFO.
Iâd like to remind you that during the course of todayâs conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties as outlined in todayâs press release. As weâve highlighted before, the risk factors in our press release and SEC filings are not standard boilerplate. We update these risk factors every quarter, adding and dropping language and changing the order depending upon the timing and potential impact of the concerns that we foresee.
We believe forecasting results of operations is difficult and we ask you to focus particular attention on these risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by any such statements. For further information, please refer to the companyâs Forms 10-K, 10-Q, todayâs press release and other SEC filings.
Please note that all financials, metrics and comparisons are stated in terms of continuing operations, which exclude Altec Lansing or the AEG division. The sale of Altec Lansing was effective as of December 1, 2009.
Plantronicsâ third quarter fiscal 2011 net revenues were 181.6 million, compared to guidance of 180 to 185 million. Plantronicsâ GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.64 in the third quarter, compared with $0.47 in the same quarter of the prior year.
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.66 compared with $0.50 in the prior year quarter, and guidance of $0.55 to $0.60. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter includes stock-based compensation charges, restructuring and other related costs and purchase accounting amortization, all net of associated tax benefits and a tax benefit from expiration of certain statutes of limitations.
Iâd like to remind you that on the Investor Relations section website â section of our website; we have an updated PowerPoint presentation as well as an Analyst Metric Sheet with the financials and metrics released today. Weâll also be holding an analyst and investor meeting on May 18 at New York Stock Exchange, please contact me for more information.
With that, Iâll turn the call over to Ken.
Ken Kannappan
Thank you, Greg. And thank all of you for taking the time to listen to our call. Iâd like to start with the key takeaways for the third quarter. Our third quarter net revenues were within our guidance range and the quarter was highly profitable, meeting the high end of our operating profit and earnings per share objectives. This was achieved through strong office and contact center revenues in all geographies year-over-year including increased sales of Unified Communicationsâ headsets and continued high product margins.
We believe that the global economic environment continues to improve, particularly in Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific regions. Second, we believe that the recent introduction of Microsoft Lync along with advanced platforms from Cisco and Avaya will increase the rate of UC adoption and we are already seeing increased activity among enterprises.
Overall, we continue to see increased levels of UC interest, evaluation and adoption, cross geographies, industries, and throughout all size enterprises. We believe that our competitive win rate remains high. And despite the competitive nature of the market our margin of this product group are better than what we would expect for an early stage market.
We believe the calendar 2011 will be a transformative year for the UC market that will begin to have a meaningful benefit to our revenue and profitability in fiscal 2012. Third, while mobile revenue grew 57% sequentially on a pretty decent seasonal up swing the overall category is down from a year ago.
Furthermore the outlook for the category growth remains weak. However, we remain the market leader in the U.S. and our profitability improved from last quarter and last year. This year, Plantronics is celebrating its 50th year anniversary. And last week we had a major launch event including new products, a new website, a new brand message and an IT tool kit to facilitate UC deployments.
We have a webcast of this event, which is currently available on our website and I encourage you to watch it, if you have time and you havenât already. Our vision and strategy is to make communications more effective in our brand message is simply smarter communications.
People can communicate in more and better ways than ever before. And unified communications further increases their capabilities and options. With so many ways to communicate, from voice to video to conferencing, so many different ways you could reach someone, so many devices you could use, including the PC, which is still unfamiliar as a phone to many people. The challenge is to make everything you choose to do easy and intuitive.
To do that, communications needs to get smart in order to be simple. Knowing the best way for you to answer a call and letting the system automatically know your availability. Over the years, the office has transformed from four walls, a desk, and a computer to something much more fluid.
No matter the location, home, airport, coffee shop or cafe, todayâs distributed workforce requires instant access to information and people. We all want solutions that save time so we conduct our business with more productivity and efficiency. Plantronics is uniquely positioned to understand the needs of this new world and create an interface for voice, communications, whether users want to communicate via PC, mobile phones, desk phones, or soft phones.
Our new products address the changing workplaces and modes of communication needs. Plantronics new voyager pro UC with our patented technology enables you to answer mobile phone and PC calls simply by placing the headset on your ear. No buttons to press, no applications to open, no voice commands required.
From either device the headset senses whether or not it is being worn and routes the call appropriately. The voyager pro UC brings a new level of intelligence to PC and mobile phone communications by integrating with PC soft phone clients.
For example, when youâre on a mobile phone conversation, voyager pro UC automatically informs applications such as Skype or Microsoft Lync. You are busy and changes your present status to busy so contacts know not to interrupt you.
Similarly, if you are on a Skype call, voyager pro UC updates your status on Microsoft Lync. The smart sensor technology automatically pauses streamed media for mobile phones and PCs when the headset is taken off and automatically reassumes the stream when the headset is put back on.
The voyager pro UC also eliminates accidental dialing by locking the call button when the headset is not being worn and features auto pause for streaming media. If your PC is locked you can still answer phone calls with your voyager pro US. You donât have to worry about missing calls as you type in your PC password.
Our next family of products is called the Calisto 800 Series. This is the first speaker phones in our unified communications product portfolio that combine multi-device hands-free connectivity with intuitive visual call management to future full duplex wideband audio.
The Calisto 800 series products were optimized for use with Microsoft Office Communicator and Lync and designed for private office and home office workers who depend on multiple communication devices to collaborate effectively.
Included in this family is a unique wireless microphone that provides excellent private speaking audio quality with freedom of movement, so you can connect this to your landline, your PC, and your mobile phone, answer any one of those products, have an integrated call log so you can call back on any one of those.
Finally, we introduced the industryâs first complete set of tools, training, and documentation for IT departments in an online UC Toolkit. The Toolkit is a portfolio of IT best practices, guidelines, recommendations and training tool that encompass the entire lifecycle of Unified Communications implementation. Helps IT organizations to easily implement the best deployment practices and ultimately optimize our companyâs UC investment.
Since the end of fiscal 2010, we have improved our profitability, grown our cash balances, improved our inventory turns, our collections, and our on-time delivery. But most important, we have invested heavily to prepare for the growing UC opportunity.
Our strategy for UC is unchanged. Number one, continue to deliver a superb user experience for the high value added portfolio. Number two, partner with the major UC vendors to make our products tightly integrated with their platforms and with system integrators, so that we are the UC communications product of choice. Number three, grow our sales reach and depth and continue to lead all headset sales in this important category.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Barbara to discuss our quarterly results.
Barbara Scherer
Thanks, Ken. We had a solid quarter with revenues of 181.6 million and non-GAAP operating profit of 40.6 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 were well above our guidance of $0.55 to $0.60, primarily due to tax items.
Without the favorable tax items we would have been at $0.60 a share which was the high end of our guidance range for non-GAAP EPS. We were also strongly cash flow positive generating approximately 29 million in cash flow from operations in part due to improved inventory turns.
Our total net revenues were up 15.7 million, or 9% compared to the third quarter last year. OCC revenues of approximately 123 million were up 19.9 million or 19%, compared to Q3 last year, while mobile revenues of 43.2 million were down 3.7 million or 8%.
Within OCC, we experienced another quarter of double-digit revenue growth in every region of the world. In terms of products, both UC and traditional products contributed to the 19.9 million increase in OCC revenue from year-ago quarter.
UC revenue was 13.5 million in the quarter, bringing fiscal year-to-date UC revenues to 36.6 million. At 123 million our OCC revenues were also up 5 million or 4% sequentially.
Our mobile revenues were down from the year-ago, primarily due to factors that increased demand in Q3 last year, such as hands-free legislation in Canada and a small amount from Serbia and a BMW hands-free campaign that were not present this Q3. In addition, the U.S. market for Bluetooth is fairly weak, and we lost some market share in the U.S., although we gained share in EMEA and Asia-Pac.
On a sequential basis, our revenues were up in all product categories and in all geographic regions consistent with the growth we typically experience in the December quarter. Geographically, our mix was 57% domestic and 43% international, compared to 60/40 in Q3 last year and 61/39 sequentially, and the 57/43 mix represents our highest ever international mix driven by strong revenue growth in our EMEA and Asia Pac regions for really all of our products.
Our non-GAAP gross margin was 53.2% compared to 48.9% in the December quarter last year. The 4.3 point improvement was primarily due to three points from higher standard margin, approximately half of that from favorable mix and half from improvements in product margin themselves, and 1.1 points from lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty.
I would also like to point out that our gross margin on UC products was up from Q3 last year and also increased sequentially. We had a non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4% in Q3 up from 19.2% in Q3 last year. All of the 3.2 point improvement is due to gross margin. Our operating expenses were, in fact, a bit higher as a percent of revenue in the year-ago quarter.
As noted in our call last quarter, our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was the highest in over five years on an unusually strong OCC mix at 75% of total revenues and was expected to decrease on a more typical OTC mix of 65 to 70% of revenues, which is what, in fact, occurred in Q3.
Turning to taxes, our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, compared to 24.9% in the year-ago quarter. The lower than anticipated tax rate was primarily due to the cumulative benefit of Congress extending the federal research tax credit during the quarter, meaning we recorded a benefit not only for the December quarter but also for the four quarters prior to that.
Also, related to the R&D tax credit, we had a change in our estimate of required reserves, which was smaller than we had previously. In total, the benefit of these R&D tax credit related items, together with a few other very small items is $3 million, or $0.06 per share. On a GAAP basis our Q3 tax rate on income from continuing operations was 13.6% compared to 20.5% in the prior year quarter.
The current quarter tax rate includes a tax benefit of 1.6 million related to the release of tax reserves due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation. The year-ago rate also included the tax benefit of 1.2 million in tax reserve releases for similar reasons. As a result of all of the above, our Q3 non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 30% to 32.6 million compared to 25 million in the year-ago quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, our strong profitability helped to generate approximately 29 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter. In addition, we received proceeds of 33.6 million in cash from stock option exercises and 9 million from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China. Our primary uses of cash in the quarter were 10.3 million to buy back stock, 5.9 million in CapEx, and 2.4 million in dividends.
We ended the quarter with 414.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, which were up approximately 55 million from 359.4 million in September and 369 million at the end of fiscal 2010. We also have 18.1 million of long-term investments, up from 14.8 million at the end of September. And of the 414.3 million in cash equivalents and short-term investments at quarter end, 146.9 million was domestic.
Cash collections were strong and DSO decreased to 55 days from 61 days in the same quarter last year, and increased from 54 days sequentially. The quality of our aging continues to be very good.
Net inventories were down 5.8 million from September and non-GAAP inventory turns increased from 4.1 in the September quarter to 5.3 in the December quarter. The increase in inventory turns is consistent with the increase we typically experienced in December quarter as a result of increased inventory movement during the holiday season and is in line with our goals. In Q4 we expect net inventories to increase our inventory turns to decrease slightly.
On the CapEx front, our Q3 capital spending was 5.9 million, up from 1.3 million in the prior year-ago quarter and up from 3.2 million in Q2. As noted in the prior quarter, the increase in CapEx is attributable in part to our investment in an expanded solar energy system at our corporate headquarters.
Depreciation and amortization expense was 3.6 million in Q3, which was down from 4 million in the year-ago quarter and 3.8 million in comparison with Q2. We expect capital expenditures for F11 to be in the 15 to 16 million range and depreciation and amortization also to be 15 to 16 million.
Turning to the business outlook now, we typically experience a decline in revenues from the December to the March quarter due to a seasonal downturn in demand for consumer products. We expect this pattern to recur in the March quarter. We believe our net revenues will be in the range of 167 to 172 million on a decline in revenues from consumer products, partially offset by growth in OTC product. A 167 to 172 million would represent 3 to 6% growth in total from our Q4 FY 10 revenue of 162.3 million, but please do recall that Q4 last year was a 14-week quarter. And we are expecting strong OTC growth compared to Q4 last year.
On January 21 we agreed to accept a payment of 5.1 million to dismiss litigation involving the alleged theft of our trade secrets by a competitor in mobile headsets in exchange for a full release and settlement of the claim. We therefore expect to record these proceeds as part of operating income in Q4.
Depending on the revenue mix and other factors, we believe non-GAAP operating income will be approximately 40 million to 42 million compared to 35.8 million in the 14-week March quarter last year and would expect a 12% to 17% year-over-year nominal increase. Based on all of the above, we currently expect non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be $0.58 to $0.62.
And finally, the GAAP charges we currently expect include approximately 4.2 million in equity compensation expense and 0.3 million in purchase accounting amortization, bringing total estimated GAAP charges to 4.5 million pre-tax and 3.1 million or $0.06 EPS after-tax. We thus expect GAAP EPS on continuing operations of $0.52 to $0.56.
With that Iâll turn it back over to Catherine, the conference facilitator, for the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Bright.
Ken Kannappan
Hi, John.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Thank you. Hello, Ken. Hello, Barbara. Hello, Greg. Ken, UC â sequentially you increased this quarter. In your prepared remarks, you talked about the rate of adoption to continue to increase, and alluded to FY â12 to be a transformative year. Number one, how do you think that ramp is going to play out, and number two, are you gaining more visibility in that segment of your business?
Ken Kannappan
Okay. So let me comment a little bit on what we expect, and I have to say that some of this is a hypothesis rather than known fact. Over the course of the time period in terms of UC, weâve gone from what I would call people knowing that itâs the next-gen, feeling that they wanted to evaluate it at some times for extended time period, as they knew that they would ultimately wait for next-gen technology before going forward with actual rollouts.
Those organizations that decided they were going to proceed with rollouts, we often saw them take quite some time to define a rollout plan, call it three months or longer, and then we saw the rollouts go in the three to 12-month timeframe.
We believe that the technology is now generally speaking reached a maturity point that more organizations are going to have a faster evaluation. Meaning that theyâre already familiar with the tools and capabilities, and that, therefore, as they get, link, and make a decision about links and weâve already seen more sales for link, and the competitive products that in some cases they were trying to decide between, that they will make those decisions on a slightly more timely basis and still think it could be three months or so for those who are at that decision point.
For other organizations, it may still take them some time before they conclude that theyâre going to go forward. But I think, if you will, a significant chunk of the market will go forward during the course of the next year. We expect it will still take them close to three months to figure out an actual deployment plan, and then the rollout of that plan will take another, call it three to 12 months. So thatâs roughly our expectation.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Do you think youâre gaining more visibility?
Ken Kannappan
Yes, I do think weâre gaining more visibility. Again, I think there are a number of organizations that do intend to move forward. Having said that, I also want to caution that in the case of link, for example, it was announced December 1, it wasnât immediately available to everybody for full trials, and so some organizations clearly have not had a chance to go through that, and so we, therefore, donât have that feedback at this point in time. So I think our visibility will increase during the course of the March quarter. I think weâll start to see some revenue impact personally in the June quarter, but I also think during the June quarter our visibility will become dramatically higher than it is right now.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Any of the assumptions that you the eve made in the market opportunity, have any of them changed, particularly the attach rate, cannibalization of core OCC?
Ken Kannappan
No you know we actually did a fairly extensive re-review because we wanted to update that analysis that weâve done at an early stage and overall what we really did was reconfirm the assumptions that we had in our model. Iâd say thereâs probably been a little bit of a geographic distribution where the markets for a variety of country specific regions from China and India are a little less than we had expected but thatâs been offset by a greater interest in Europe and to some degree in the states.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Barbara, question, Plantronics continues to perform above the stated long term operating model, particularly on the gross margins. What do you say to investors that are concerned that gross margins might decline in the near term?
Barbara Scherer
To investors that are concerned they might decline in the near term so in the near term I donât think that is a very large risk. Thereâs always some risk, but really the model is premised on winning and winning big in UC, and participating fully in a fairly robust consumer market. And even within UC, I must say that weâre â so far, weâre earning better gross margins than we thought we might at this stage, but the market is still very small, and there is lots of road in front of us. So I think it continues to be appropriate for us to have that as a long-term model, but in the short term, I donât see any significant pressures on gross margin.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Last question, youâve built and continue to build a strong balance sheet. Talk about the use of cash, particularly maybe a dividend discussion, and with the potential maybe to have a tax holiday to repatriate some of that offshore cash.
Ken Kannappan
Well, that is a topic that â we have obviously noticed our rising cash balance, and it is a topic that we intend to discuss with our board of directors. Itâs something that we think is probably appropriate to change in the context of a new fiscal year. But again, thatâs a board decision. Weâll have that discussion â communicate exports. We do believe that weâre dealing with cash above and beyond that needed in the business. As it relates to tax holidays, everyone on the phone knows probably this better than we do, we have no inside information about the prospects. Clearly if such a tax holiday came about, we would be very pleased to repatriate the cash and then figure out how best to use it for shareholders, whether it was a larger repurchase or a larger dividend of some one-time nature or something like that. But as of yet, thereâs nothing on the table that weâre aware of that we think is going to happen.
John Bright â Avondale Partners LLC
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
Thanks for taking my question. Iâve got a couple of them as well. First, on the Bluetooth business, you said the category was down in the U.S. or you expect it to be down. Can you talk a little bit about your gross margins and how you manage that business in a down environment, and are there any drivers that you expect to turn that trend around this year, or will that continue to be a challenge business, in your opinion?
Ken Kannappan
Well, sure, several things have affected the business, and some of them I think could get better, and some of them I think represent opportunities for us to evolve the business. So over the course of this year, of course, this has been affected by overall consumer demand, and a recovering economy and recovering consumer spending would certainly help that.
I think that thatâs manifested itself both in terms of the replacement rate of headsets and people buying new smartphones and keeping their headset as well as other factors. I think that another thing thatâs certainly been the focus of the carriers on both other accessory category, cases and so forth where they get better margins when they do on headsets and other things, consistent with their own efforts in their business, and those have a way of cycling over time, and in this case some of the category shelf space has been diminished, and that at some point in time gets normalized and stable.
I think we also had a few times when the market was very hot, and therefore, there was a lot of fulfillment of new products by shipping to peopleâs homes. Obviously, we depend on in-store traffic for accessory attach rate and so that definitely makes a difference and can evolve.
I think also that thereâs a great deal of interest in content delivery. More people are using smartphones for streaming media, for games, for a variety of music and movie applications and that represents an opportunity to provide a different type of product solution in order to increase your sales in that area, and thatâs an innovation opportunity. Thereâs other opportunities to bring more people into the category.
I think from a gross margin standpoint, thereâs been a little bit of a squeeze in terms of the business in the middle of the market, where we had a very strong position, so thatâs probably hurt us a little bit. Nonetheless, I would say that our overall gross margins have held up rather well.
We havenât seen â weâve certainly seen some excessive black Friday promotions at the low end that probably created a little bit of price degradation, may be a little bit of margin pressure on us, but overall weâve managed to compete very well in terms of our offering. So I think our gross margins, despite some of that weakness, have been good.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
And then on Unified Communications, although it was up, it was pretty slightly up in December relative to September. Was there some forward buying in September or I would expect a little higher of a number. Was there anything specific?
Ken Kannappan
Well, I think that thereâs a few factors. We expected December would probably be a slightly slower level of growth. I mean, one, of course, you had the launch of link coming in December 1st. So not a lot of people are going to roll out R2 just before link is available. It wasnât kind of an easy upgrade path. Different server architecture, a whole bunch of other things so people werenât going to naturally roll something out just before the new version is available.
And, of course, the new version requires a little bit of evaluation, et cetera, before you go forward. I think thereâs a few other things that are kind of disassociated with end of the year in terms of bringing out a whole new system that weâre going to make that by nature a slightly slower period. So that was not a surprise to us, actually, I thought the fact that we had sequential growth in that environment was actually good.
Barbara Scherer
Yeah, it was really kind of a natural digestion period for the market, too. Evaluate link, even us as a partner and obviously being committed to rolling out link, weâre only rolling it out right now. Thatâs as fast as we could go. So in terms of just having it available for people to purchase and move forward with, itâs been limited.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
Got you. And then Barbara, you mentioned inventory to expect to be up a bit in the fiscal fourth quarter, but you didnât exactly say why. Is there a specific driver of that?
Barbara Scherer
Well, itâs really more around the outlook beyond this quarter and in terms of the â kind of the timing of â normally March is up quite a lot. Itâs a very strong month and so we tend to bring in a lot of inventory and be prepared. And we generally â we donât always see that, but we generally expect that to carry on into April. So we need the inventory in place and in this quarter with Chinese New Year and whatnot, sometimes thereâs a little bit of disruptions and catch-up. And so I donât expect it to be up much, but I think it could be up a touch.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
And in terms of the tax rate expectations going forward, I presume 20% is not correct for Q4. Whatâs a good number to use?
Barbara Scherer
Right. So if it werenât for the litigation settlement that I mentioned, I would have asked you all to be using 25.5% for Q4, which would get you to about 25% for the year in total. And we would be looking at something around â probably around 26% next year. But with this litigation settlement, itâs still to be sorted out in terms of exactly, which entities that income gets attributed to. But to net it all down, Iâm assuming a 27% rate in Q4 because thereâs kind of the underlying rate, and then thereâs this kind of discrete item that may attract a higher tax rate.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
Okay. And the non-GAAP EPS guidance of 58 to 62, is that includes the litigation settlement, what is the actual per share amount that that includes?
Ken Kannappan
Itâs about $0.05.
Tavis McCourt â Morgan Keegan & Co
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Ken Kannappan
Youâre welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra.
Rohit Chopra â Wedbush Securities
Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple of questions. International was very strong. Youâre playing on somebody elseâs tariff (ph) in EMEA. And I just wanted to know what youâre doing differently there. Maybe thereâs some products that are different or just maybe give us a sense there, because Europe has faced some recent pressure, especially at the consumer level, and I think theyâll face some more. And then Barbara, just quickly on the CapEx, when does that tail off and come back to a normalized level, I realize what youâre building over there, but I just want to get a sense of where we settle in?
Ken Kannappan
So Iâll make a couple of comments on Europe. I donât want to go into a great deal of detail, because, of course this is about, in this case, competitive items, and we do have a competitor, and so some of our areas we do like to keep confidential. I would say that as a general rule of thumb, Unified Communicationsâ creates a more open opportunity for us to talk to account that perhaps did not want to talk to us before. They may have been satisfied with our competitorâs products and services, but this is now a big deal. This is now a major decision. And so when they talk to us on that, they are able to talk to us more broadly.
I think from the standpoint of the consumer products, some of the gains there reflect, again, the fact that some of our new products are very interesting stories, have some unique capabilities, and thatâs attracting interest and intention. So let me just kind of leave that at that. Barbara, do you want to cover the other?
Barbara Scherer
Yeah. So on CapEx, if you look at it for the year as a whole, weâre running around 2.3% and prior to the recession, historically weâd run around somewhere between 2 and 3%. In the recession, we cut back dramatically on CapEx, and then things have gotten better. Weâve added some back. The solar project is fairly big, so we spent 2.4 million on that during the quarter, and by the time â once itâs done and we get the rebates that we think weâre going to get, the net cost of that will only be about 3.2, but we canât account for the rebates until, one, we get the project done, we get it tested in service and apply for the rebates, and theyâre not a straight guarantee. So thatâs a little bit of a bubble, but in general, spending around 2% of revenue or so for CapEx is well within the range of normal. So I donât think weâre much out of the range of normal, even with the solar project.
Rohit Chopra â Wedbush Securities
Okay. And then, Ken, can I just ask you a quick follow-up on the UC products? Are there more UC products that are coming out for the Lync side or the Microsoft partnership? And the reason I ask is that, it seems like your competitor has a lot more skews (ph) that are certified with Lync than you do, just according to their website. And I just want to know if thereâs more products on the way, and maybe thatâs also part of the driver and your thoughts behind UC growing as your go through the upcoming year â the upcoming calendar year.
Ken Kannappan
Well, I think we have actually a full portfolio. And itâs actually not the case that people want to have too many products or overcomplicate some of these rollouts. So I think we have a very good portfolio. It is the case that there are some areas that weâre definitely looking to improve our competitive position, and it is also the case we will constant be bringing out new products, in some cases frankly not to increase the number of products we have. We may be killing an existing product, and weâre just moving to the next generation.
But actually I think we have a very broad and effective portfolio, not just for Lync, but generally, and so weâre happy with it. At the same time, gives us the key focus of continuing ongoing development it is. Some of the things that went through in the call that were also in our webcast are really not so much about added products, this is about added capabilities that are very, very important to organizations that are also being uniquely offered by us.
Rohit Chopra â Wedbush Securities
Thanks, Ken. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore.
Mike Latimore â Raymond James & Associates
Great, thanks. On the â you mentioned that the gross margins on UC products are maybe a little better than expected at this point in time. Is that largely related to pricing, or more your cost for components, or both?
Barbara Scherer
I think itâs definitely a combination. The market is competitive, and weâre competing well and still winning. In terms of the mix that weâre seeing, itâs not as much toward the low end as we thought was possible in this market. And as weâve designed products, weâve certainly thought about where we think the competitive pricing levels could be, and so we have designed with that in mind, so I think itâs our own mix, and we â I donât want to say overestimated, but â because it is a very competitive market, but weâre expecting it to be very competitive. And weâre still doing a bit better, even in that environment.
Mike Latimore â Raymond James & Associates
And so is it â is the favorable mix partly because itâs â I mean is it â are the people that are buying these products, the ones that would have bought your high end anyway, and they really â were really not going to kind of the other segment of the potential user base yet?
Barbara Scherer
Yeah. We are getting â itâs a mix, right. Everything is a mix. And weâre definitely getting some of the lower end corded products for the broad employee population. The organizations that weâre seeing roll out UC generally are doing it for a very, very, very large percentage, if not the entire organization, because once you go to UC, you really need to just operate as a business that way. But thereâs a large mix, especially in terms of revenue dollars, a lot less on units, but in terms of revenue dollars, a very large percentage of the mix thatâs wireless and thatâs higher end.
Mike Latimore â Raymond James & Associates
And it seems like a lot of these RFPs, well, for link in particular, seem to also want to have some IP phones in the mix. Where thatâs key, do you have a sense of what percent of the endpoints would be headsets versus these IP phones?
Ken Kannappan
Well, so we do have a sense. Iâm not going to comment on it, but I will say that youâre right, that thereâs a very significant portion of it that is IP phones, and I would say, Polycom and Snom have done quite well in that market. But, yes, absolutely, there is a significant portion of it that has been phones.
Mike Latimore â Raymond James & Associates
All right. And then with regard to the Bluetooth market, you commented in September that your partners were lowering their inventory levels, and then are we back to kind of normal inventory levels now for that channel?
Greg Klaben
Thatâs what it appears to be the case, yeah. So I think we â we did have almost the full sequential increase that we were expecting, not quite, but it was a very large sequential increase, and the retail on hand, weeks on hand numbers look very normal at this point.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
Good evening. Thanks for taking the call. Just to circle back on the â I guess the sequential growth you saw in UC, understandable why it kind of slowed in this quarter, but a month in here, could you just give us a little color on what youâre seeing now and the outlook going forward?
Ken Kannappan
Sure. This particular quarter again, I would say that we would not expect to have huge growth for the simple reason that, again, itâs still very early relative to time frames for people to evaluate link, put together decisions, put together deployment plans and proceed with the rollout. So our expectation is that we would see more impact in terms of potential growth in the June quarter than in the March quarter. Every sign for us is that the momentum is overall building within the UC market, both Microsoft and other vendors, such as Cisco and Avaya. So we remain very much believing that things are on track.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
Okay. And Barbara, the SG&A was up a little more sequentially and year-over-year than I was modeling. I was just wondering if you could highlight whatâs kind of driving that increase.
Barbara Scherer
Well, in terms of the SG&A, one of the items in there is certainly the expenditures weâve been making, pursuing this trade secrets matter, which has since been settled and weâll get the settlement proceeds in Q4, but that was a significant amount of spend in the December quarter versus pretty close to nothing on that matter, any similarly sized matter in the year-ago quarter, and then, of course, we have our 50th year coming up, which weâve kicked off, and there were a lot of things that we were doing to prepare for that in December, and to prepare for the CS show in terms of a whole variety of materials.
Youâve seen our new website, I hope. And so the investment on the marketing front is up, and weâve also been steadily expanding our field sales force, and weâre going to â we intend to continue to do that really over the next 12 months, and so year-over-year, our sales force is up pretty significantly as well. So we have been investing in the growth opportunities that we see, and those are three of the key areas.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
Okay. So I guess going forward, I mean, does it come down as a percent of sales, continue to rise notionally or how should we think about that?
Barbara Scherer
Actually, we do expect in total for our operating expenses to actually be down sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Part of it is much lower litigation than some of the structural things like, yeah, we hired people. Okay, theyâre in the mix. But, no, I donât expect it to continue rising as a percent of revenue. It varies by quarter, depending on what activities we have planned, but probably more typical levels that youâve seen in the past from us.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
Okay. Then just lastly here, on the revenue guidance, could you just kind of give a breakdown of how that shapes up between mobile and office contact center?
Ken Kannappan
Also we donât typically break it down between those two, but I do want to give you some, without giving exact numbers, give more insight into it. So we do expect the mobile numbers to be down from the year-ago mobile numbers, not just sequentially, but also in comparison to Q4 last year, and we expect the OTC revenues to be up sequentially from Q4 â up sequentially from Q3 and also up quite significantly from Q4 a year ago. I think that should help you map it out.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
It does, thanks. And then maybe just one last one. The new smart sense technology, really kind of enhancing interaction with the UC products, can you just talk about the pipeline of kind of some other issues you might have to differentiate the product portfolio?
Ken Kannappan
Well, so we are clearly continuing to invest, as we indicated. We think that the announcement we made with not just the sensor technology, but frankly what weâve done with that to integrate with the platforms and create some really unique capabilities for people are pretty dramatic and to have the opportunity and build kind of the infrastructure for that platform to bring out more capabilities, and our discussions with customers are probably going to be a little bit less about, hey, less hereâs the new headset design, and, hey, hereâs what we can now do. And so thatâs going to become more and more the dialogue. I think that the product thatâs close to â and lot of you have got private offices, and some of you when youâre on a call for hours donât necessarily want to wear the headset. People on video calls, itâs nice, you donât have the headset as part of your appearance, but having a wireless mic, allowing you to hear well and talk is kind of the unique capabilities. Itâs got some really nice integration in terms of its capabilities.
We mentioned the call log before. Another one is the mute. People forget whether theyâre on mute. You could mute these things on the headset, on the phone, on the line and itâs nice to have it all synchronized and clearly visible.
So thereâs a lot of capabilities that weâve got and weâll be continue to come out with and new product. I donât really want to specify specifically, but I will tell you that we launched our new brand, and we call it Simply Smarter Communications.
And again, itâs all about the fact that there are so many things you can do with so many devices, so many different modes of communication, so many ways, somebody might try to reach you, where you might or might not be available, and the ability to make it smarter and to also make it simpler for you to do things is core to what weâre trying to do.
One of the applications that we mentioned earlier, but I didnât highlight on this call also is one that we call instant meeting, and what itâs about is, if you have a call, conference call, and youâre needing to drive somewhere in the car, you donât necessarily remember the exact moment to dial in. You could miss that call. And you get a prompt on your BlackBerry or something, but if youâre not looking at it, if youâre looking at the road, you might miss it.
So we give you a prompt, both an audio prompt as well as pop-up, to give you two chances. You can either say yes or press a button, so you can be totally hands-free. Normally, if you remember it, you can open it, and then you can auto dial the number, but youâve got to scroll down. And then youâve got a complicated thing of trying to memorize some numbers, going back to the other screen, entering the code. We do all that automatically for you.
Dial the number. Dial the conference code. If youâre the leader, we dial the leader pin. We know your outlook, so if itâs within the scheduled time of a call and you get disconnected, we automatically reconnect it for you. Thatâs another example of the way that we can make a typical communication activity a whole lot simpler, a whole lot easier for you.
As a side benefit with that, weâve been using this internally with Plantronics, and one of the things we discovered is, weâd have somebody on four minutes earlier, we have somebody else five minutes late, kind of relapsed nine minutes dead time for the first caller. And the nice thing is by getting everybody on at the same time, you actually save a significant amount of organizational productivity.
So there are other things that weâre working on. Again, I donât really want to give the specifics, but theyâre all about how can we, from our unique standpoint, being focused on the person, being connected to the person, integrate to the advantage of the system and the way that makes the system more effective for everybody, or make things easier and simpler for the end user.
Gregory Burns â Sidoti & Company
Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
The last question comes from the line of Paul Coster.
Paul Coster â JP Morgan
Good evening. This is actually Maria on behalf of Paul. Thank you for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been answered already, but I do have one last. So I was wondering, how do you think about the tablet market, and especially as it pertains to the next-generation tablets and voice application on them.
Ken Kannappan
Weâre excited about tablets. There are people clearly looking to use tablets for mainstream voice communications in the office. If we say that the phone is a familiar device, and then the smartphone and the PC is less familiar, from the standpoint of voice communications, the tablet is at the extreme end of that. To the extent that youâre using the tablet for great content delivery, you donât necessarily want to overlay on that a keypad and other functionality.
The ability to have the controls and the interface be, again, very intuitive and very easy is a natural opportunity for us. So on the one hand I donât want to kid anybody, this is very nascent, itâs okay, but on the other hand, kind of like a PC, they donât come with a phone handset attached. If you want to use those for voice communications or audio content delivery, we think that represents a growth opportunity for us, and an opportunity where weâre already, typically compatible with the technology being used.
Paul Coster â JP Morgan
Excellent. And then just briefly also, I know we talked about the unified communications a lot but I was just wondering, is there anything specific that you can point to that could give us some confidence that the revenue from the UC pick up in the June quarter? Thank you very much.
Ken Kannappan
Well, I mean, thereâs nothing specifically I can give you except to point to the fact that if you talk around the industry, will you find that more and more corporations are looking at it and moving forward with plans in that area. Microsoft did announce on their call that their sales involving link had grown where they had been, and thatâs obviously a leading indicator for us as to where deployments will ultimately go. I think you will hear similarly from the other vendors that their UC sales outlooks and their pipelines are continuing to rise.
Operator
