Greetings and welcome to QEP Resources' Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. William Kent. You may begin.
William Kent
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the QEP Resources' Second Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. With me today are Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Doleshek, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Torgerson, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Business.
If you've not done so already, please go to our website qepres.com to obtain copies of our earnings release, which contains tables with our financial results and the slide presentation, which contains maps and other supporting materials.
In today's conference call, we will use a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is referred to as adjusted EBITDA in our earnings release and SEC filings and is reconciled to net income in the earnings release and SEC filings.
In addition, we'll be making numerous forward-looking statements. We remind everyone that our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. We refer everyone to our more robust forward-looking statement disclaimer and discussion of these risks facing our business in our earnings release and SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.
Richard Doleshek
Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. I will quickly give you some color about our second quarter 2015 results and our updated guidance for 2015 and then turn the call over to Chuck.
Our second quarter results were substantially better than our first quarter results. We delivered significant production growth in the quarter and we also realized higher prices for our production. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $279 million, up 25% compared to the $223 million generated in the first quarter of the year and the $368 million of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2014.
Production in the second quarter was 80.9 Bcfe or 5.7 Bcfe higher than the 75.2 Bcfe reported in the first quarter of the year. Well volumes were 4.9 million barrels, up 400,000 barrels. NGL volumes were 1.2 million barrels, up 250,000 barrels. And natural gas volumes were 44.5 Bcf, up 1.9 Bcf from their respective first quarter volumes.
Crude oil comprised 36% of our total production in the second quarter, which was about the same level as in the first quarter of the year. Oil production was up 338,000 barrels in the Williston and up 56,000 barrels in the Permian from their respective first quarter volumes. Pinedale gas lines were up 2.5 Bcf and Uinta Basin gas lines were up 0.8 of a Bcf while Haynesville volumes were down 1.3 Bcf from their respective first quarter levels.
Our updated guidance for 2015 oil production is a range of 18 million to 19 million barrels, this midpoint of which is up .75 million barrels from the previous guidance midpoint and reflects results that continued to improve in both the Williston and Permian Basins. Our updated guidance for NGL volumes is unchanged at 4 million to 4.3 million barrels and our updated guidance for natural gas production is unchanged at 165 Bcf to 175 Bcf.
QEP Energy's net realized equivalent price, which includes the settlement of our commodity derivatives, averaged $5.94 per Mcfe, which was $0.33 per Mcfe higher than we realized in the first quarter of the year. Weighted average field equivalent price in the quarter was $4.80 per Mcfe, which was 12% higher than the first quarter. The equivalent price reflects field level crude oil prices that were $51.34 per barrel, field level NGL prices that were $21.68 per barrel, and field level natural gas prices that were $2.52 per Mcf.
Field level crude oil revenues accounted for 64% of total field level revenues, which was about 8% higher than in the first quarter. Derivatives settlements added $92.3 million or $1.14 per Mcfe to QEP Energy's net price realizations compared to $1.36 per Mcfe in the first quarter.
QEP Energy's combined lease operating and transportation expenses were $133 million in the quarter, up slightly from the $129 million in the first quarter and up marginally from the $132 million in the second quarter of 2014. On a per unit basis, lease operating expenses were $0.71 per Mcfe, which is down $0.11 per Mcfe from the first quarter and transportation expense was $0.93 per Mcfe, which was up $0.03 from the first quarter. Reflective of improved operating results, we have revised our guidance for leased operating and transportation expenses downward by a nickel per Mcfe to be in a range of $1.65 to $1.80 per Mcfe for full-year 2015.
Excluding an $11.2 million noncash charge in the second quarter related to freezing our defined benefit pension plan, G&A expenses were $40 million, which is down about $7 million from the first quarter primarily as a result of lower labor costs and lower stock compensation expense. Our guidance range for G&A expenses for full-year 2015 is unchanged at $170 million to $185 million, excluding the $11 million charge for the pension curtailment.
In the second quarter we generated a net loss of $76 million. There were several noncash items that impacted net income. As a result of forward curve crude oil and natural gas prices strengthening at the end of the quarter, the value of the derivatives portfolio was lower than at the end of the first quarter, resulting in a $158 million unrealized loss. DD&A expense was up $20 million from the first quarter driven by higher production volumes. We also recorded a gain on asset sales of $24.5 million primarily due to the sale of our Arkoma Basin properties.
Capital expenditures for E&P activities on an accrual basis for the second quarter were $275 million, which was slightly less than our second quarter adjusted EBITDA. As Chuck will describe in a moment, in spite of making the decision to keep the rig running in the Uinta Basin through year end, we expect our capital expenditures to decline in the second half of the year and are not changing the guidance range for 2015 capital spending.
With regard to our balance sheet at the end of the quarter total assets were $8.4 billion, shareholder equity was about $3.9 billion. Total debt was approximately $2.2 billion, all of which was our senior notes and we have $446 million of cash. And just to remind everyone, our credit facility is not a reserve-based loan and it is not subject to semiannual borrowing base redeterminations. It is a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving corporate credit facility that matures in December of 2019 and the facility is undrawn.
I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.
Chuck Stanley
Good morning, everyone. Since Richard has already discussed our second quarter operational and financial results, I'll spend a few minutes briefly reviewing each of our core areas to share some recent operational highlights before we move on to Q&A.
During the second quarter our asset teams delivered a number of very positive results in our core plays. In the Williston Basin, we saw some very early, very encouraging results from our high-density infill program in second bench Three Forks test. Our Permian Basin team continues to deliver improvements in well performance and is moving toward pad-focused development mode in de-risked intervals while they continue to test additional prospective zones.
At Pinedale, our new completion design continues to deliver superior production results at no incremental cost. And in the Uinta Basin, we remain excited about the huge long-term development potential of this multi-Tcf resource. We're driving substantial capital and operating efficiencies in all areas while delivering well results that are exceeding our historical results and our expectations.
While total gas equivalent production declined 4% from the second quarter of 2014, crude oil production was up 22% from the second quarter of last year and up 9% sequentially from the first quarter of this year. If you exclude the production from our Midcontinent assets, the majority of which were divested in 2014, our total gas equivalent production was actually up 10% from the second quarter of 2014 on a continuing basis.
As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we deliberately slowed our drilling and completion activity through the first few months of 2015, which was allowed us to capture additional service cost savings and drive further operational efficiencies. During the second quarter we continued to make significant progress lowering drilling and completion costs across all areas of our operations. It's important to point out that not all of the decreases in completed well costs are from service and supply cost reductions.
We also continued to see significant efficiency gains in both drilling, thanks to faster drill times and to pad-focused development, and in completions, thanks to zipper fracs or simultaneous frac operations and ongoing completion operation optimization, both of which have continued to generate significant component of long-term sustainable completed well cost reductions regardless of the commodity price and service cost environment.
As we work through our inventory of previously drilled wells that are waiting on completion, AFEs for new drilled wells are, in our oil plays have declined over 30% from late last year. And even at Pinedale, where it's really tough to squeeze out additional savings, we've managed to drive down gross well costs on newly drilled wells by over 14% from last year.
Before I move on to the discussion of our operational results I want to take a minute to provide some color on our capital program for the balance of 2015. Rest assured we're keenly focused on our 2015 capital program and it's important to emphasize that our capital spend is front-loaded and that we have a good explanation as to why. Because of the significant inventory of wells in progress at the end of last year and early this year, we are just now seeing the full benefit of lower service and supply costs and operational efficiencies begin to flow through our financials.
As Richard indicated, we expect our second half capital investment rate to decline from the first half of the year as we are able to fully capture the significant reductions in the cost of services and supplies and through continuing efficiency improvements in our drilling and completion programs. And while we cut our operating drilling fleet by more than 60% since the peak of the, in the third quarter of last year, we still expect that lower service and supply costs and ongoing operational efficiencies combined with our superior asset quality will allow us to deliver double-digit year-over-year crude oil production growth while spending in and around EBITDA.
Now let me provide some details on our recent operational results by area. As I do, you can refer to the slide presentation that accompanied our earnings release yesterday afternoon. In the Williston Basin we had two QEP operated rigs running at the end of the second quarter and they were both on South Antelope. Williston Basin net production averaged approximately 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was about 89% liquids during the second quarter with an 11% increase over the first quarter of this year and a 48% increase over the second quarter of last year.
We completed and turned to sales 20 gross operated wells during the quarter with an average working interest of 72% with 15 new completions on South Antelope and 5 on Fort Berthold. We also participated in 11 gross outside operated wells that were completed and turned to sales during the quarter with an average working interest of 9%. See slides 5 and 6 and 10 for the location of our Williston Basin acreage.
We're extremely pleased with the early production performance from the first family of high-density infill development wells that we completed and turned to sales about three months ago on our South Antelope acreage. This group of wells evaluated both 400 and 600 foot high-density infill well spacing and also tested the second bench at the Three Forks formation. The early life cumulative performance of the production from these high-density wells is tracking pretty close to the performance of our recently reported enhanced completion design well performance.
And more importantly during the early life, these wells are significantly outperforming the original wells that we drilled on 1,280 acre spacing, which we would call the parent wells on this acreage. So that would be four wells per reservoir per 1,280 acre spacing unit. On average these wells have delivered 90-day cumulative production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent each, which is outstanding early performance. You can see the details of the relative performance of these new high-density infill wells on slide nine in our slide deck.
Our initial test of the second bench of the Three Forks formation on our South Antelope acreage is exciting too. In its first 90 days online, this well has produced over 98,000 barrels of oil equivalent placing it significantly above the 90-day cumulative production performance of the first generation middle Bakken and first bench Three Forks wells that are also plotted on the graph. Assuming early life performance of these wells holds up, the results will have a profound implication for the future development inventory on our South Antelope lease hold.
We have additional pilots underway to further refine our high-density spacing model and help evaluate the potential for development of deeper Three Forks benches including one third bench of the Three Forks test, which is scheduled for completion late this year. Based on the early results, our remaining development inventory at South Antelope could now exceed 400 additional locations. Slides seven through nine provide additional details on our high-density infill pilot program on South Antelope.
On the enhanced completion front we continue to pump about 1,000 pounds of proppant per lateral foot over about 50 stages in all of our wells. And as we collect more production history from the older wells completed with this design and we continue to add new wells to our database, we remain convinced that the enhanced completions are critical to maximizing the recovery of oil from the Bakken Three Forks petroleum system.
And as you will note on slide nine, the performance of our enhanced completions, that red curve on the graph continues to positively diverge from the performance of the original completion design parent wells in the later time periods. We expect that the increase in this performance will ultimately result in increased recovery or increased reserves from these wells. But obviously it won't be proportional to the early life increase performance.
As mentioned on our first quarter call we applied this new completion design to our most recent wells drilled in the Fort Berthold acreage and early performance from those wells is very encouraging. While we don't believe we have a large enough sample size and enough production history to draw empirical conclusions at this time, the data from our own South Antelope pilots as well as other activity both on the Fort Berthold Reservation and immediately adjacent to our acreage by other industry participants makes me optimistic about our ability to increase development inventory on our Fort Berthold acreage as well.
Even with some of the exciting changes to our Williston Basin drilling program, we've made huge progress driving down well cost. And while current gross well AFEs are down on average about 30%, per-well productivity is up thanks to our enhanced well completion designs. You can find details of our current Williston Basin well costs in yesterday's release and on the accompanying slides. We plan to invest about half of our capital budget in the Williston Basin for 2015 and we plan to operate two horizontal rigs in the play for the remainder of this year.
Turning to the Permian Basin, daily production during the second quarter averaged 11,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, comprised of about 81% liquids. That's up 27% from last quarter and 48% from the second quarter of 2014. You'll notice if you compare the periods that the percentage of liquids in the gross production stream that we reported declined slightly from the first quarter, which is actually a good thing as we saw an increase in gas and total equivalent production volumes as a result of new gas processing arrangements, less weather-related downtime in the second quarter, and due to some upgrades that we made at the field level.
The Permian has really started to deliver from an operations perspective. During the quarter our Permian team turned the three strongest QEP operated wells to date to sales in the Wolfcamp D, a 1,310 Boe per day 24-hour peak rate, in the Wolfcamp B, a 1,484 Boe per day 24-hour peak rate, and in the Spraberry Shale, a 1,556 Boe per day 24-hour peak rate. In total we completed and turned to sales 1 vertical and 12 horizontal QEP operated wells in the quarter. The QEP operated horizontal wells were comprised of eight Wolfcamp and four Spraberry wells.
10 of the 12 wells that had cleaned up and hit maximum rate by the end of the quarter had an average maximum daily production rate of 11,138 barrels of oil equivalent per day while 7 of the horizontal wells with enough production history had a maximum average 30-day production rate of 832 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Both statistics, as many have already remarked in notes that were out this morning, are significant improvements over our previously reported results and have been driven by continuous improvements in our completion design, carefully targeted landing zones, and by improvements in our artificial lift design for early well production performance.
During the second quarter we began moving our Permian operations to pad development mode. The reasons behind this move are two-fold. First, pad- development greatly reduces the downtime from offset well fracs as we can now batch complete new wells. And second, drilling and completion costs are reduced significantly due to the efficiencies that are inherent in pad development operations. Our current Permian well AFEs have been reduced by an average of over 30% compared to last year and we believe that there's more opportunity to drive these costs event lower. You can see the details in our release and accompanying slides for more information on well costs.
We had two operated horizontal rigs active in the Permian at the end of the quarter. One was targeting the Spraberry Shale and one was targeting middle Spraberry. We expect to run two rigs targeting horizontal intervals for the remainder of the year and that'll be focused primarily on the Spraberry. We plan to invest about 25% of our total capital budget in the Permian Basin in 2015. Slides 11 through 13 provide details of our Permian Basin properties.
At Pinedale at the end of the second quarter we had three rigs operating on our acreage and during the quarter we completed and turned to sales 35 gross wells, including 7 that we operate but in which we had only a small overriding royalty interest. During the second quarter our Pinedale net production averaged 274 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day. That's comprised of about 14% liquids.
As a reminder in January we began rejecting ethane from Pinedale production and given the current processing economics our guidance anticipates ethane rejection for all of 2015. This decision, of course, results in a 7% to 8% reduction in natural gas equivalent volumes compared to ethane recovery, but it has little impact on our revenues given the current value of ethane.
We continue to see very encouraging results from our new Pinedale completion design incorporating 100 mesh proppant. The new design has resulted in an average of 141 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day increase in 180-day cumulative production volumes compared to our old design. And since the new design is simply a change in proppant size, it doesn't cost any more than the old design. You can see the results of this new design and the performance of the cumulative production of the wells on slide 15.
We currently plan to invest about 17% of our capital budget in Pinedale this year running three rigs for the balance of 2015. Slides 14 and 15 provide additional details on our Pinedale asset.
Turning to the Uinta Basin, their production averaged 80 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day comprised of 22% liquids during the quarter 45 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which came from our Lower Mesaverde play. Like Pinedale we began rejecting ethane in the Uinta Basin in January and our 2015 guidance anticipated ethane rejection through the entire year. At the end of the second quarter we had one operated rig drilling our seventh horizontal well in the Lower Mesaverde play in the Uinta.
During our first quarter call we discussed some exciting results from our sixth Lower Mesaverde horizontal well. It continues to perform quite strongly and it's currently produced over 1.8 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent post-processing in rejection mode during its first, ethane rejection mode during its first 165 days online. And don't get this confused with dry gas from other parts of the country. Based off second quarter price realizations, the revenue composition from this well's production is over 40% liquids and provided an uplift of nearly $1.00 per Mcfe.
We continue to believe that the Lower Mesaverde play as Pinedale-like potential and this latest well is a major step on the path to economically developing this multi-Tcf resource.
During the second quarter we also completed and turned to sales a pad with eight vertical Lower Mesaverde wells. These wells, which were drilled to test the Pinedale-style development concept, were a portion of our Uinta acreage. We're still in the early stages of clean up and initial flowback at the end of the quarter.
Due to the encouraging results from our six Lower Mesaverde horizontal well, we expect to continue to operate one rig for the remainder of 2015 in the Uinta Basin and that's a change from our original 2015 plan as we're excited and encouraged by the results and want to continue to evaluate the Lower Mesaverde potential. Slides 16 and 17 provide details on our Uinta Basin Lower Mesaverde properties.
Our result for the second quarter exemplify our ability to quickly adjust to the challenging and volatile commodity price environment while we remain focused on driving capital and operating efficiency in the areas of the business that we can control. We significantly reduced well cost across our core plays, we've greatly improved overall well performance through enhanced completion designs, and we've accomplished all of this while under spending adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.
We're also aggressively pursuing organic opportunities to boost the inventory depth on our existing asset base and we've made some great progress to date on high-density infill development in the Williston on South Antelope. And we're working diligently to define the infill opportunity on our Fort Berthold Reservation leasehold in the Williston as well. We're making great strides delineating the potential of the Spraberry in the Permian and are fine tuning our development plans based on those results. And finally, we continue to make great progress unlocking the tremendous potential of our Uinta Basin asset as evidenced by the performance of our most recent horizontal Lower Mesaverde well.
We've worked diligently to transform QEP into a more focused and balanced E&P company with a deep portfolio of high-return investment opportunities that are capable of delivering superior returns in a variety of commodity price market conditions. We remain focused on improving the quality and depth of our portfolio by continued innovation, superior execution, our relentless focus on driving down cost, and by identifying and driving organic opportunities. Our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity and a cash position of nearly $450 million and an undrawn, unsecured non-reserve-based credit facility of $1.8 billion puts us in a great financial position for the future.
It's clearly a tough commodity price environment for all oil and gas producers but we remain intensely focused on driving improvements in the things that we can control to enable competitive performance regardless of market conditions.
With that, Rob, we can open the lines for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Rezvan with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Tim Rezvan
Folks, I had a couple of questions I guess first on kind of the front-loaded skew to CapEx for the year. If we're still looking at the current commodity price environment, I mean how are you thinking about kind of setting activity levels for 2016?
Chuck Stanley
Right out of the box the 2016 question, Tim. Good morning.
Tim Rezvan
Good morning.
Chuck Stanley
So a couple of things, one, I have just - I can't be prouder of the incredible accomplishments that our team have made in the first half of the year on the operations front not only in driving down cost but also superior execution. We've seen drill times come down in our core oil plays by 25% or 30% compared to the average from last year. Even at Pinedale we're seeing some improvement. So when we think about well costs we're seeing a 30% decrease in well costs in our core oil plays. But that's not all just service and supply cost reductions, it's also operating efficiency.
I think there's still opportunities to drive additional operating efficiency. We continue to see progress on drill times in the Williston. More importantly in the Permian as we move to pad development we're seeing drill times come down. Obviously rig moves and things that in between the drilling activity also come down and therefore costs continue to come down. So I'm prefacing my answer to the question with the observation that we're in a mode of remarkable continuous improvement operationally, which is helping drive down well costs.
It's also resulting in better wells. As we noted on the call, incredible performance out of the infill wells in the Williston Basin, much better than we had anticipated and we're very excited about that. We're also very pleased with the results we're getting out of our Permian program as we're really hitting our stride not only in our completion design and execution, but also where precisely we land the wells in the horizontal target intervals. And we're also operationally making progress on artificial lift.
So production volumes are coming up so we're seeing a stronger production response for every dollar of capital employed. If we think about 2016 it's pretty darn early given all the variability around pricing, uncertainty around pricing as well as continued improvements in production performance of well cost. If I think about a 2016 price environment that sort of mimics what we saw on average the first half of this year and I think about capital in the second half of the year being down sequentially versus the first half of the year and you can do the math as Richard and I both told you, we think capital declines as we see the full benefit of the costs and efficiencies roll through the financial statements.
If we annualize second half CapEx and think about that as a 2016 run rate that's probably a good starting point. Now there's, the level of activity that's driven by that, obviously rig counts may not be as important because as I jokingly said anticipating this question to someone this morning, with the continued efficiency gains we might be able to drill all of our wells with one rig next year. So it's a remarkable amount of efficiency that we've been able to wring out. So I wouldn't think about it in terms of rigs per area. I would think about it in terms of capital and then production response.
So activity levels, I would think about number of wells drilled and then obviously the east well that we're drilling, we're getting more production. So it's too early to give you a hard number but I think that gives you some sense. And then production response, flattish to slight growth if we were to take that second half run rate and push it into 2016.
Tim Rezvan
Okay. I appreciate that answer. I'll switch gears a bit. I know you've talked in the past about the Uinta possibly replacing the Pinedale that's going to be your core Rockies gas play. Can you talk about how much running room you have left in the Pinedale? I know you're running three rigs now. What's the life of that play kind of looking like?
Chuck Stanley
It's probably got four or five years of development opportunity left and part of that depends on how many wells we choose to drill and complete over the next timeframe. And we continue to look at Uinta and see the results there, we may make capital allocation decisions to push more dollars toward the Uinta because given the liquids content and given the performance of the most recent wells there, we think it's, it may be a higher return project than even Pinedale, which is as you know is a great asset but one that we may choose to slow down on as we accelerate the Uinta.
Tim Rezvan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Corales with Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Corales
Good morning. Just a question on 400 locations at Antelope. Can you maybe talk about how a drilling unit would make up?
Chuck Stanley
Well at 400 plus locations, and it would be over 400 locations, that would, in essence, be a doubling of the well count or wells drilled in between each of the existing wells, both in the first bench and the middle Bakken. And it includes some second bench wells. And right now, Brian, we've got one well that we reported in the quarter. There's another second bench well that's online that looks better than the first second bench well, much to my chagrin because I have to admit I was a doubter on second bench performance based on just the petro-physics of the play. And as we noted in our release and in my prepared remarks, we're also preparing to evaluate. We'll complete a third bench test in the fourth quarter. We have not included any third bench potential in that inventory. So it's a combination of first and second bench development and the middle Bakken development.
Brian Corales
Okay. And maybe just a follow-on to what Tim was asking right off the gate on 2016. Can you talk about the level of capital spend? Would you still see the oil production grow? Or be flattish? Or is that where you're talking total production? And would it be flattish through the whole year or just from 2015?
Chuck Stanley
Look I feel like I'm out over my skis here because it's mid-year 2015. We haven't even, we have, as I'm sure every ENP companies does a ton of different scenarios. And part of the answer to that question is what do you think the relative pricing of natural gas for crude oil is going to be next year because obviously we'll allocate capital around between gas and oil depending on pricing and returns. So to give you an answer at the level of granularity that you're asking is a little premature.
At this juncture, flattish overall and I would say flattish gas and oil volumes are a reasonable base case. And we think we can do that without spending EBITDA significantly going into 2016. But as I said, lots of variables here. We continue to have to revise and refine our production forecast just based on the well performance that we're seeing across the board in the Williston, in the Permian, at Pinedale as we're seeing the results of these enhanced completions that we're pumping. And we're seeing much more encouraging results in the infill program than we had initially anticipated.
Brian Corales
Okay. No, fair enough. And one last one from me, in the Uinta that seventh well, I think you commented you said it was flowing back. Are you seeing, I mean from the early stage flowback, does it look just like the sixth? Or I mean can you maybe comment or elaborate a little bit more?
Chuck Stanley
So the seventh well we just turned around and started flowing back so it's too early. I mean it's just barely started to make gas. We, the comment that maybe you misheard or maybe I misstated, we completed a pod of eight vertical Pinedale-style wells that were flowing back right at the end of the quarter. And they continue to clean up and that's - part of the scenario here is or part of the question is how to maximize recovery of gas in place on this acreage.
Parts of it are clearly amenable to horizontal development. Other parts, in order to maximize the recovery of the gas in place may require a hybrid development scheme where we drill some Pinedale-type vertical wells in order to capture all of the different horizons.
Brian Corales
Thanks, guys.
Chuck Stanley
Thank you, Brian.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Tameron with Wells Fargo Bank. Please proceed with your question.
David Tameron
Hi. I'll wait to ask my 2016 question until my follow-up. But can you help me out, so in the Williston, just in the Williston infill you previously said it was tracking below the 1,280 spacing. Now it sounds like they're exceeding that. Can you just talk about what you think is driving that? Is it proppant, I mean is it just more frac? Is it more sand? Is it placement of - can you just give me a, best you can some color on that?
Chuck Stanley
Sure. I think your statement when you said it was tracking below the original completions, in the last quarter I sounded a note of caution and maybe it was premature but I wanted, I tried to make a point that I think that the analyst community and investors maybe misheard that when we ran the economics on these infill wells, they made economic sense at 65% or so of the performance of a parent well. So when I looked at the infill program and approved the first round of pilot wells that was the risking basically that we put on the performance. And that's what we put on the production forecast as well.
What we're seeing is performance that's well above the original completion performance and in fact it's tracking pretty close to the high profit volume completions that we've done. The slide that we included in the release, slide nine, I think drives home the point graphically. This includes, that graph includes all five wells. So it includes the 400-foot spaced infill wells, the 600-foot spaced infill wells and the one Three Forks second bench well.
One of the things that has sort of suppressed that blue curve a bit was early on, we had some problems with the 400-foot spaced wells. We think it was basically sand obstructing a portion of the wellbore, and in the process of running a pump in the first of those wells to try to get it to kick-off, we burped the well and it started flowing. And it basically now, the 400-foot spaced well looks just like one of the 600-foot spaced wells which looks just like one of the high density wells.
So the first 90 days, 120 days of production was impacted by a well that about halfway through the time period started performing normally. We have another 400-foot spaced well which was also performing abnormally, and it has now started responding better over the past week or so.
So we're going to - we have a lot to learn on how to manage these wells, not only the new wells that we're drilling, the new infill wells, but also the offset older wells in order to minimize downtime, maximize early time performance. The one thing that is astounding to me, and it wasn't in my prepared remarks, but if you have any reservoir engineering background, you'll appreciate this. All of these wells are flowing naturally. They're all flowing naturally, so these are infill wells that are offsetting older wells. And so one of the questions that we worry about is how much depletion there had been from the older wells and would these wells flow at all when we completed them and flowed them back?
They're all still flowing naturally. The cumulative production therefore over the first 90 days is not manipulated by large pumps and an attempt to make the performance look similar to the old wells. The original wells were completed and flowed naturally. These infill wells are completed and flowed naturally from the get-go. So it's an interesting observation because it tells you there's a lot of reservoir energy there, there's a lot of oil in place there, and the performance we're seeing is confirming what we've known all along which is the South Antelope area is some of the best rock with some of the highest oil in place in the basin.
It's also in a spot in the basin where there's lots of reservoir energy. And we're seeing incredible performance. The thing that, outstanding performance. And the thing that if you stop and think about it, 100,000 barrels out of these infield wells. And that's both the 400 foot one that we got cleaned up. The other one I think will come up on that performance curve as we get it cleaned up. But 100,000 barrels on average from these infield wells stands up well against the cumulative early-time performance of damn near any oil play in North America. So these results are just astounding to me and very exciting. And obviously we're still processing this. We have other infield pilots that are ongoing. But just the infield performance in and of itself is very exciting.
The other thing, as I said, the second bench test was just, is amazing. The second bench well which we've turned to sales is not in the release. But we'll talk about it in more detail in the second quarter is performing better than the first one. So all of this stuff points to an incredible additional resource that isn't fully reflected in the NAV of this asset in either the stock price or in our own evaluation at this point.
David Tameron
Okay. That's great color. Thank you. So I'm going to go to 2016, but I'm going to try come out philosophically. How do you think about your program? Obviously you have some cash on the balance sheet, and you guys got conservative early which in hindsight obviously was the right place to be. Are you in a, some CFOs I talk to say hey, right now it's about survival and I want to be here in 12 months. And you guys with your balance sheet don't have to worry about that. But how do you think about 2016? So if we're 55, 60, do you tap the balance sheet and try to accelerate? Or do you want to be within cash flow? How do you think about that?
Chuck Stanley
It's philosophically, the unanswerable question is, what's the shape of the price curve going forward? And is this a two-year downturn, 18 month downturn? We just don't know. So obviously both the CFO who I guess I'm answering for and I have a philosophical bend to run the company for the long term and not get too far out over our skis on our leverage metric, especially in an environment like this where we just don't know how long the downturn will last.
It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It didn't make a lot of sense to me in the first half of the year to drive production growth into a declining commodity price into a dramatically decreased commodity pricing environment and then in an environment where service costs, service and supply costs, were both declining. In the second half of the year, I think we still have the opportunity to capture some additional service and supply cost decreases.
But now we're seeing the benefits of the efficiency gains. So we can anticipate further improvements and capital efficiency, and therefore production response for every dollar weak invest going forward. I don't want to overdrive activity and lose that efficiency. And I don't want to necessarily drive huge production growth into an uncertain commodity price environment and stress the balance sheet to do it. So you'll see us continue to wait and watch.
And then the other, the third component is there may be opportunities as things continue to play out in the second half of the year and into 2016 to pick up low-cost assets out of the chaos that this commodity price environment is creating in the industry.
David Tameron
Okay. No. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks.

Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
David Heikkinen
Good morning, guys. And thanks for the answer on the infield. We were amongst the other analysts that misunderstood 65%. And your results look good. As we think about your pace going forward, can you just talk about how many wells you get completed given the efficiency improvements that you're seeing in the lowest and in the Permian? I'm just trying to recalibrate to the faster pace that you had in the second quarter.
Chuck Stanley
Sure. If we look at the inventory, second half doesn't look dramatically different than the first half in total well completions with the exception of Pinedale, obviously, where we normally slow down stop as we move into the winter. So fourth quarter we'll see a pretty significant decline. The Williston remaining completions on a gross basis we've got 35 or so, 35 and a lot of that depends on our completion pace going forward.
And year-to-date I think we completed 36 or so. So there's a mix of both South Antelope and Fort Berthold in that first half. Most of them will be South Antelope in the second half as we continue to, we really have been focused, as you know David, on trying to get all these pilots on line so that we can really finally decide do we do 400 foot spacing or 600 foot spacing. And that's a big determiner. The other thing people in a couple notes people have focused on the declining duck count or uncompleted well inventory count. And there's a couple of things there. Obviously completion pace consumes part of it, but we're also adding to it with the drill time efficiencies that we're seeing.
So when you see even in an area like the Williston where we thought we had wrung out most of the efficiencies, when you're seeing spud to spud times come down six or seven days at South Antelope, we're continuing to build up an inventory of uncompleted wells which is not building up, but replacing our inventory of uncompleted wells thanks to just faster drill times and more productive drilling rigs.
David Heikkinen
And then just on the Williston, there's two follow-ups. One the non-consents on these lower AFEs surprised us at South Antelope. Do you think that continues so your working interest may be a little higher as well?
Chuck Stanley
The non-consent that we picked up was one partner. I think it was about $6 million or $7 million. I'm looking at Matt Thompson. About $7 million. And it was from a partner who, how should we put it, was having some financial problems. So I would, I was shocked to see somebody not consent to wells. But hey, look we'll take it. It's free acreage. And so going forward a lot of the stuff we're drilling and completing, the partners are pretty strong. So I don't think we'll see a lot of non-consents in the second half of the year there. I wouldn't model a change overall.
David Heikkinen
Yeah. And then the well costs down so much. You're not doing anything different from a well design that would cause any lowering of productivity? It's really just better efficiency and better cost structure? Nothing that is actually going to...
Chuck Stanley
No, it's the same - as I mentioned we continue to think 1,000 pounds, maybe a little more per lateral foot is the right proppant volume. So proppant loading hasn't changed. Stage count hasn't changed. We're just getting more and more efficient. So even, as you'll recall, we talked about the team has convinced me to try some plug-and-perf wells, which we have been completing along with the sliding sleeve wells at South Antelope. And we had initially thought that they were going to slow us down, they were going to be a lot more expensive. What we're seeing is we can zipper frac those wells and not quite get back the sliding sleeve efficiency and completion but pretty darn close.
So we're not seeing the delays in getting those wells online, and we're not seeing the resultant shut-in impacts that we had originally anticipated. I will say as an aside, we do see a slight improvement on plug-and-perf but it's not sure it's an economic improvement on plug-and-perf performance and the team's still working on long term analysis there to decide on this infill program what the right answer is.
So we're not changing the completions on the drill times, as I mentioned. The drilling team in the Williston Basin has just made remarkable performance improvements, so on average we're down about 30%, 25% year-over-year, our second quarter compared to our average drill times last year. So in thinking, in adding the completion improvement and the drill time improvements together, that's a big piece of it. And then of course just the savings and day rates on rigs and on pumping services and sand et cetera.
The other thing, David, to think about, these high-density infill wells, they share some facilities. They share a surface location. We may have to modify the service location but for the roads, the basic infrastructure's in place. We're able to share a LACT unit potentially for each one of the pads. Some tankage - we may have to add some tankage especially since these wells are coming on at very strong rates. But there is an infrastructure sharing benefit on the infill program, which helps reduce the cost as well.
David Heikkinen
Okay. And then just bigger picture on thinking about your valuation, your liquidity, cash on hand, there must be some expectation for an acquisition or almost a cash bond buyer in your stock price today. And so how do you think about the acquisition market, what your appetite is? You talked about oil and gas ambivalence and time that you think you have to use the canteen up? Or would you use that canteen of liquidity?
Chuck Stanley
Richard has it locked away in a lock-box. So one of the things that I think, one of the messages that we're trying to convey not so subtly here is that we think we just solved part of the inventory problem. Obviously we're going to look for opportunities to bolt-on to our existing assets. But look, the acquisition market, especially the asset market, hasn't been very active so far. We've seen a few deals. We're seeing some distressed assets start to come out now, and there may be some opportunities. Our A&D and new ventures teams are continuing to evaluate opportunities. But it hasn't been a huge deal flow in the first half of the year.
The question around what do we do with the balance sheet hasn't changed. We're going to look for opportunities to invest in assets that will generate returns above our cost of capital. And if it's assets, if it's continuing to de-risk and build inventory on our own assets for the time being until the right opportunity presents itself, that's what we'll do. We don't feel, we haven't set a deadline for ourselves to say, gee, we have a big pile of cash, we've got to spend it by X date. And so that hasn't changed and I don't think it will ever change as far as this management team is concerned.
David Heikkinen
Thanks, guys.
Chuck Stanley
Thanks, David.

Our next question is from Brian Gamble with Simmons and Company. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Gamble
Good morning, guys. Maybe if we could finish that thought up real quick, Chuck, from a slightly different angle. When you think about the wells that you drilled, the success you've had at Williston, in fact the success you've had in pretty much all your basins over the last six months, has it changed your appetite to bolt-on to any one of those basins? Has it changed the economic thought of walking into basins and knowing that an asset that you may not have completely been on board with at the beginning of the year is now much more attractive from an acquisition standpoint?
Chuck Stanley
If I answered that question, I'd just shoot myself in the foot looking for deals. So I would say that, just to echo what I said earlier, we have been extremely pleased with the performance of some of the enhanced completion designs and also some of the target intervals that we have seen, whether it be the third bench of the Three Forks in the Williston, second bench of the Three Forks in the Williston, or some of the shallower targets in the Midland Basin, the Spraberry Shale, the Spraberry, the lower, I'm sorry the middle Spraberry. So as we continue to think about that it sort of informs our target area. The problem is those results also inform the sellers, right? So it's not like we suddenly have this great tactical advantage in acquisitions because everybody's seeing all of the results. They're all in the public domain and it makes, it doesn't really change the bid outspread or the calculus in my mind around evaluation or at least it hasn't to date.
I think what changed the calculus is a realization that prices may be lower for longer, A. And B, that liquidity is a precious commodity and some have it and some don't and that may be the driver of opportunity more so than geology.
Brian Gamble
Okay. I'll take that. And then you mentioned of the 400 locations you're talking about the infill that there were some second bench wells in there. If the additional second bench well that you're testing you've had some success already, if that continues how many additional locations in the second bench could you theoretically add from an organic basis?
Chuck Stanley
So the first two, the first well, first second bench well is on that Thompson unit, which is on sort of the Northwestern part of our acreage. The second well is on the extreme northern part of our acreage. We really need to get some tests across the Southern end in order to extrapolate the inventory count from logs and from core, which by the way both show that the second bench is wet. It's hard to make an extrapolation.
We really need to see production performance and we've got four more second bench wells that are either drilled and cased or will be drilled and cased and complete five more that will be tested between now and the end of the year and one third bench well, which we should have online around the end of the year. So we have a lot of additional data coming in that will help us. It's just a little too soon to extrapolate that.
Brian Gamble
Fair enough. I appreciate it, Chuck.
Chuck Stanley
