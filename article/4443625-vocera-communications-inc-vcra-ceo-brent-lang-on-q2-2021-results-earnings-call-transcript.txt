Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Vocera Communications Conference Call. My name is Emily and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I now would like to turn the presentation over to your host for todayâs call Sue Dooley of Vocera Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Sue Dooley
Thanks, Emily. Hello everyone. Welcome to Voceraâs conference call to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings. This is Sue Dooley and joining me today are Voceraâs CEO, Brent Lang and Steve Anheier, our CFO. Earlier today, we distributed a press release detailing our announcement. The release is posted on our website at investors.vocera.com and is also available from normal news sources. This conference call is being webcast live on the Investor Relations page of our website where a replay will be archived.
Before we begin our prepared remarks, Iâd like to take this opportunity to remind you that during the course of this call we will make forward-looking statements regarding projected operating results and anticipated market opportunities. This forward-looking information is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Voceraâs filings with the SEC and actual results or events may differ materially. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements. On this call, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our posted earnings release.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Brent.
Brent Lang
Thanks, Sue. Hello, everyone. I hope this finds you well. We have a lot of good news to cover this quarter so I will jump right into it. We just completed the strongest second quarter in the companyâs history, building on the great start we achieved in Q1. Our solution is a rising priority for hospitals and our market leadership position is translating into consistent outstanding performance. The success was broad-based across our business. Stellar execution from our sales team drove tremendous bookings growth, and our services organization continues to effectively deploy our solution leading with our clinical expertise.
In a moment, I will speak more about the drivers of our robust performance. But first, here are some highlights from Q2. Bookings growth was terrific with many large new customer wins and sizable expansions bolstered by our high competitive win rate and reliable customer renewal. Software bookings set a new record, driven by excellent performance in our Engage software and the full functionality of our software platform.
Revenue in Q2 grew 19% compared to last year and grew 19% overall in the first half of the year. Like Q1, software revenue was a bright spot, with great execution in large new system deployments by our services group. At the end of Q2, our combined backlog and deferred revenue was $218 million up 71% compared to this time last year. This reflects three favorable dynamics, the strength of our bookings, contributions from recent acquisitions, and the healthy and growing trend toward long-term contracts and software maintenance renewals. In the area of product leadership and innovation, Vocera Ease won the MedTech Breakthrough Award, a real honor among a competitive field of household names with substantial market clout. This award demonstrates the impactful nature of this patient-facing solution. And finally, we closed the PatientSafe transaction in May. We are well underway with the integration and are thrilled with the momentum.
Here are some of the highlights from our sales and services organization during the quarter. Our Q2 bookings performance was simply outstanding. We added several new hospital names, drove expansions among existing customers, and continue to build on the healthy trend of sizable multi-year maintenance renewals, a meaningful indicator of the value our customers align to our solution. These large wins and multi-year renewals enrich our long-term visibility which Steve will discuss more in a moment.
Overall, during the quarter, we had 6 wins over $1 million, a remarkable performance in any quarter and especially for Q2. These big wins included such names as Summa Health, Tampa General, Newark University, and Kaiser Permanente. And as we previously highlighted during our Q1, we won the largest booking in our companyâs history with Providence Health Care. This win provides a shining example of our enterprise-selling approach, the strength of our Engage software offering as well as the opportunity that exists for growth within our installed base.
Iâd like to take a moment to share the story of our success. For a decade, Providence has been Vocera customer across a disparate group of facilities and in various limited departmental deployments. In the recent quarters, our enterprise sales leaders elevated the discussion to the C-suite with the aim of creating a unified and strategic enterprise-wide approach to communication. Our team worked with the clinical leadership to address the systemâs most severe and pressing clinical workflow challenges. Together, we created a plan to rollout our solution across over 50 hospitals, spanning the U.S. over several quarters. We will deploy in the acute care environment limited to nursing, respiratory and key physicians, and there is plenty of room to broaden our footprint as we demonstrate the achievement of the clinical and workflow benefits. With Providence, we hope to set a standard for other leading hospitals who look to them as an example of best practices in their approach to clinical communication and collaboration.
We also won $1 million plus booking at the Malcolm Randall VA this quarter. The fed continues to roll out our solution as the de facto standard, and this win underscores our continuing opportunity for growth in this market. With the Q3 selling season in front of us and plenty of opportunities to land new facilities and cross-sell within existing facilities, we expect to continue our strong bookings momentum in both the short and longer term. In international, Canada produced particularly strong results as the team leverages the northern supply chain purchasing agreement we put in place last year intended to speed up the acquisition process by enabling hospitals to buy from us without having to issue an RFP.
In Australia, New Zealand, we continue to expand beyond the aged care marker with a great win at the Southern District Health Board, our second acute care facility in New Zealand. Also, our recently signed agreement with Wavelink in Australia will add local expertise to our marketing and sales efforts. International is a large opportunity and a top priority for us, and we are pleased to have a growing overseas pipeline. Outside of healthcare, weâve brought in two new Four Seasons Hotels expanding our strong presence within this marquee brand.
On the service side of our business, our teams completed a robust schedule of new customer deployments, motivated by a desire to replace pagers and wireless phones and improve patient care, Care Team safety, as well as throughput and efficiency. Froedtert Hospital, UCLA Health, and Norton Womenâs and Childrenâs Hospital are all rolling out our solution in large-scale deployments. As weâve discussed in prior quarters, our professional services team is executing well, continuing a level of excellence through a combination of onsite and remote services and online tools that allow our teams to be efficient and optimized in time with customers. In other news, we just launched Vocera Edge, our cloud-based clinical communication and collaboration solution, derived from our recent acquisition of PatientSafe.
With Edge, customers can now choose how they want to purchase and deploy our solutions. Edge is ideal for hospitals and health systems that have invested heavily in their EHR mobile workflow software, are smartphone-centric, and prefer a cloud-based CCNC solution. This cloud-based solution simplifies system administration and enables bi-directional communication with the EHR. Hospitals can get more value from the EHR and bring the whole Care Team together centered around the patient. Two-way communication between Edge and the hospitalâs EHR system makes it easier for clinicians to complete documentation and manage patient-centric communication right from their smartphones. We expect Edge will enable us to extend our market reach, broaden physician use cases and adoption, and deepen EHR integrations to support patient-centric workflows. This is a natural extension of our strategic vision and is particularly well suited to match the speed and scale of each organizationâs needs to improve patient care, safety, and experience.
Now Iâd like to describe some of the factors contributing to our healthy market environments. Then I will take a moment to describe our view of the growth drivers that lay the groundwork for our future. One major trend supporting our long-term success is the rising importance of staff safety as a priority in healthcare. The events of the past year and a half have culminated in a new era for safety one that we believe is here to stay. Based on my conversations with hospital CEOs, prioritizing the physical emotional and psychological safety of care teams is rapidly on the rise. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services is earmarking $103 million from the American Rescue Plan to reduce burnout and promote mental health among healthcare workforce.
Modernizing communications technology is core to these principles. We believe Vocera is not only a critical part of PPE but is also a foundational element of the future of healthcare and running a hospital. I believe weâve reached an important inflection point in the desire to adopt better standards and implement change to improve safety. Care teams simply canât do their jobs unless they feel secure in their roles supported by their organizations and have the ability to communicate with their teams. At Vocera, we strive to lead our customers through thought leadership to define a new normal for hospital operations and to help hospitals envision and implement change. In May, we took our thought leadership initiatives to the next level.
We launched the groundbreaking CEO Coalition aimed at driving widespread adoption of initiatives focused on safety and healthcare. The CEO Coalition unites founding group of 10 health system CEOs who as leaders in the space authored and published a set of standards for safety and healthcare. The coalition is kicking off a national plan for meaningful change and has invited other healthcare leaders to join. Recently, Healthcare Finance News mentioned the CEO Coalition in an article as evidence of this rising priority. Another important trend bolstering our success involves hospitals looking to consolidate the number of vendors that they are working with. They want to deploy platforms that are secure, unified and fully integrated. This plays right into the heart of our value proposition and our selling approach. We have earned a powerful seat at the table to discuss clinical workflow goals, thanks to our broad customer experience and customer clinical expertise. Hospitals require a partner who can deliver results now and prepare them for this new era of safety.
At Vocera, we become the ideal partner because we have the most complete solution in the market, bolstered by a proven ability to support our customers with a mix of internal development and careful M&A. With these market factors as context, Iâd like to describe the growth drivers as we enter the second half of 2021 and begin to think about next year. First, with momentum at our side, we continue to work to drive large new customer wins and expand within existing customers who are looking to broaden their use of our solution and extend its benefits to new users. Second, we will strive to continue our strong software growth through new customer wins with Engage, Ease and now Vocera Edge.
Our international teams will seek to build on their momentum and broaden our market penetration across the regions. For our non-healthcare team, we will seek to reach into new markets like school safety. Weâre extending our strong brand name in areas, such as hospitality. And finally, we plan to continue to innovate and enhance our product offering, our market-leading position, and our addressable market. We believe our focus on these priorities is driving success and is laying the groundwork for the quarters ahead.
Before I turn the call over to Steve, I would like to summarize my commentary about our results, the environment, and the drivers of our business. Simply put, Q2 completes a tremendous first half of 2021. We achieved our strategic priorities including further penetrating the market with key wins and leading health systems, expanding within our existing customer base, enriching our software mix, growing our international presence, and leading with new product innovation. As we enter the second half of the year, we are in a great position to continue delivering on these priorities. Our large backlog and deferred revenue provide revenue visibility and help create a solid foundation for our future. Our mission is more relevant than ever, and we have a remarkable momentum in the business.
Now, Steve will cover the financial details of our Q2 results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Steve?
Steve Anheier
Thanks, Brent, and hello, everyone. We had a very strong second quarter, highlighted by bookings, revenue and profitability growth. All of which were ahead of our expectations for both the quarter and the first half of the year. Starting with revenue, we delivered $56.2 million or 19% year-over-year growth in Q2, completing an outstanding first half of the year, which also grew 19%. Q2 product revenue, which includes both devices and software increased to $28.3 million or 18% year-over-year growth. Device revenue of $16.3 million was slightly down from the prior year. But we continue to see good levels of bookings and shipments for our devices.
As a reminder, last yearâs Q2 device revenue was extremely strong, in part driven by COVID-related demand. From a first half of the year perspective, our device revenue increased. And we continue to have healthy levels of hardware related backlog, demonstrating the compelling value of hands-free communication. Smartbadge continues to gain momentum with solid bookings growth in both Q2 and for the first half of the year.
Software revenue in the second quarter was a real highlight and grew 76% over the prior year. At $12.1 million, software continues to be our fastest-growing revenue segment and being led by our Engage product line. Engageâs strength highlights the growing value customers based on our clinical integration and event-driven workflows. An example of this is the Q2 Providence booking that Brent highlighted. We are engaged with the single largest component of the deal. For the first half of the year, software revenue was up 80%, fueled by strong bookings and backlog conversion. Thanks to our strong bookings performance. Our software backlog continues to grow. And as of June 30, itâs at an all-time high. The growth in software backlog positions us well for continued software momentum and is a key driver as we progress towards our long-term operating model.
One final comment on our software business, as previously discussed, we evaluate the health of our software business by combining software with the subscription and support revenue streams, which we view holistically as a software-related business. We like this view because subscription and support includes the software maintenance contracts as well as our reoccurring SaaS offerings such as Ease and now Edge.
Software plus subscription and support revenue combined grew 34% in Q2 and represented 62% of our total revenue, up from 55% in the prior year. We expect this mix to continue to increase over the long run, driven by demand for our core voice and messaging solution, Engage and a new subscription-based software offering of Ease and Edge. Our service business continues to have strong growth rates. Service revenue increased 19% year-over-year to $27.8 million, with growth in both our subscription and support revenue as previously mentioned and our professional services revenue tied to healthy new customer deployment activity.
Now, turning to our combined backlog in deferred revenue balance, due to the strong bookings in the first half of the year and the contributions of our two most recent acquisitions, Ease and PatientSafe, we have significantly grown our backlog in deferred revenue. At the end of Q2, our combined backlog in deferred revenue was $218 million, up $91 million or 71% versus last year. The acquisitions accounted for $34 million of the increase. And excluding this, our backlog in deferred revenue balance still grew an impressive 45% year-over-year.
Now, turning to something we highlighted last quarter. We have a higher proportion of multiyear subscription and support contracts and a growing number of larger multi facility deployments that span more than 1 year. Our Ease and Edge solutions are subscription in nature and the majority of those contracts are multiyear agreements and will convert to revenue beyond 2021. We view all of this as positive for our business as our backlog in deferred revenue growth not only provides visibility into 2021, but also to 2022.
Iâd like to briefly go into more detail on non-GAAP gross margins and operating expenses. Non-GAAP gross margins in Q2 were 69%, representing a 300 basis point improvement from last year. Our product gross margins increased more than 800 basis points from last year, primarily due to the increase of high-margin software revenue in the quarter. Our device and services gross margin continued to be very healthy and consistent with historical levels. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $31.2 million, mostly due to expenses related to our recent acquisitions and our investments for growth. Now, I would like to comment briefly on our profitability. Our adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was $8.6 million and was up 49% from last year.
As a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA was 15% in the second quarter, which increased from 12% in the prior year. The growth in our software business, along with our continued focus on driving operating leverage has resulted in expanded profitability, which highlights our strong business model. Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $2.3 million, also better than last year.
Transitioning now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $292 million in cash and short-term investments, up roughly $58 million from this time last year. The year-over-year growth in cash will be attributed to our most recent strengthening of our capital structure and cash generated from operations, partially offset by our two recent strategic acquisitions.
Now, let me turn to guidance. On the strength of a great first half of the year in both bookings and revenue, we are on track to deliver strong revenue growth for the full year. Our substantial backlog in deferred revenue provides short-term revenue visibility along with enhanced line of sight to 2022. As previously discussed, the long-term revenue visibility comes from large enterprise bookings that deploy over multiple years and also our growing subscription and support business. As a result and for the second quarter in a row, we are increasing our annual revenue guidance. In doing so, we have applied our usual historical backlog inversion and visible revenue rollout methodology. And we are raising both the top and bottom of the guidance range by $3 million. The new revenue guidance range is now $221 million to $231 million.
Turning to our guidance for profitability, we are also raising the top and bottom of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $3 million. We now expect adjusted EBITDA in 2021 to be in the range of $29 million to $34 million, reflecting the impact of the greater top-line revenue and expectations and the software risk backlog mix. The rest of our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance can be found in our press release.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with the overall business momentum and financial results in the second quarter, capping off an outstanding first half of the year and leading to our new guidance range. Our solutions are rising in priority. And our recent acquisitions are adding to our strong product portfolio and enriching our software offerings. Thank you for your time.
And now, I will turn the call back to Brent.
Brent Lang
Thanks, Steve. Before opening up the call for questions, I want to conclude by thanking the entire Vocera team, which continues to execute well as we navigate this stage of the pandemic in a remote working environment. Our mission has never been more relevant than it is now. And I am very proud of how our people have risen to the challenge of this difficult time. Our business is performing well and the results we delivered are evidence that our solution is valuable and in high demand. Our teams executed well in Q2, winning impressive bookings, accelerating our revenue growth and making important strategic moves with the creation of the CEO Coalition and the introduction of Vocera Edge. In selling our solutions, we are leading with software and the results showed the power of our platform. We have a large market opportunity, a highly differentiated solution and a finely tuned selling engine generating robust demand for our unique solution.
With that, we are ready to conclude our formal remarks. Thank you for listening today. Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions. Thank you very much.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Sean Dodge from RBC Capital Markets. Sean, your line is now open.
Sean Dodge
Great. Thanks and congratulations on another great quarter. Brent, you touched on it a bit, but if we take all of your and Steveâs comments around the healthy market demand, the recent large deals just you signed with deployment that will stretch into 2022, did the 45% growth in backlog and deferred revenue when you exclude the acquisition. Help us translate that a little bit more precisely into the visibility you have now on growth into next year? It certainly feels like you are sitting in a much better position now at this point in the year than you have historically. I guess how do you feel about visibility on sustaining mid-teens or better growth into next year?
Brent Lang
Yes. I will start and then Steve can chime in here as well, but I think we feel like where we sit right now itâs midyear this year that we have got better visibility into future years than we have had in the past. And I think thatâs representative of the changing nature of our business, the increase in subscription and maintenance revenue as well as the increase in the large deals that get deployed over an extended period of time, both of those provide visibility into the future. For the rest of this year, we are using very similar methodologies for determining our guidance, but I would say that sitting here midyear, we are feeling really good about next year.
Steve Anheier
Yes. So, I will just add to that. The key drivers, as you mentioned, are very healthy, the bookings, the backlog, the deferred revenue, which puts us in a great position for 2021. And as Brent mentioned, we used a very historical conversion rate when thinking through our 2021 guidance, which now the top end is 16%, which we obviously aim to be at or be. As far as 2022, as Brent mentioned, we do have increased visibility at this time this year versus prior years. I would say, Q3 and Q4 will also be very important as we head into 2022 and we will provide the appropriate guidance at the time, but absolutely, these large enterprise bookings that are having multiple quarters to deploy our multiyear maintenance and subscription has given us enhanced visibility into 2022.
Sean Dodge
Okay, great. Thank you again.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Schoenhaus from Stephens. Scott, please go ahead.
Scott Schoenhaus
Hey Brent, Steve, Sue. Can you hear me okay?
Sue Dooley
Yes, we can.
Brent Lang
Hey, Scott.
Steve Anheier
Hey, Scott.
Scott Schoenhaus
Hi. Brent, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you are seeing â you saw revenue â you saw strength in your software revenue due to new systems deployments in the quarter. Can you just talk about which software platforms drove this growth? And was the growth mostly from new customers or was it cross-selling and up-selling to current customers?
Brent Lang
Yes, Scott. So, in terms of the product mix, most of the software growth was driven by our core communication collaboration platform, both the voice and messaging piece as well as the Engage piece. We had a particularly strong quarter with Engage. Thatâs continuing to accelerate as an important part of our business. I think I mentioned last quarter that we are seeing more deals that are actually being led by Engage, where the strategic driver behind the deal is the Engage portion with clinical workflow and then the communication piece is coming along with that. So, Engage played a really important role. At this stage, Edge and EASE are relatively small pieces, didnât play a huge role in the quarter, but it was more our core communications piece. And then the second part of your question, I am forgetting, what was the second part of your question? The deal size, yes. So, the â it was a mix actually. We had really strong new customer deployments, but we also had some great expansions. Itâs a little bit counterintuitive, but even as a bookings province technically is an expansion because they are an existing customer. And so itâs a little bit hard to differentiate between the two in terms of what technically falls in one bucket versus another, but we are continuing to see really good strength both with expansions amongst existing customers as well as new customer wins. We added a very large number of new hospitals with new bookings this quarter. And obviously, on the revenue side, the services team was doing deployments with both new and existing, so itâs across the board.
Scott Schoenhaus
Great. Thank you. Congrats on a fantastic quarter, guys.
Brent Lang
Thanks.
Steve Anheier
Yes. Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Ryan, your line is open.
Ryan Daniels
Yes, thank you for taking the question and I will add my congratulations on the quarter as well. Brent, maybe one for you, it seemed like in your prepared comments, you were highlighting renewals a lot more and talking about long-term renewals with the clients. I know you have always had a very high renewal rate in the mid-90% range or so. So, is there anything unique that got you to specifically call that out meaning in terms of the renewals or length or just ease of which they are becoming accomplished? Thanks.
Brent Lang
Yes. Hey, Ryan. So I would say that the renewal success rate has remained really, really high. the renewal success rate has remained really, really high. So, really no change there. But we are seeing an increase in the number of customers who are interested in signing up for multiyear maintenance renewals. Historically, in the business, the vast majority of the maintenance renewals were done on an annualized basis. And so they would sign a new contract each year with a corresponding new price point. And what weâre seeing a little bit more of now is customers who basically want to go ahead and issue the booking for, letâs say, 3-year maintenance renewals as opposed to a 1-year maintenance renewal. That obviously provides us additional visibility into the longer term revenue because weâre able to sort of map that out into our financial plans.
Ryan Daniels
Perfect. And one if I could squeeze in. Does that enable your sales force then to maybe focus on other things in the out years, such as new client adds or expansions because they donât have to go back for those maintenance renewals. So there is another benefit there, too. Thanks.
Brent Lang
A little bit. I mean we have a dedicated team that manages the majority of the maintenance renewals. So itâs a different selling exercise. They do a phenomenal job of building relationships with existing customers, and itâs very much of a mechanical automated or I should say, repeatable process. And so what that allows us to do is actually focus more time on customer interaction and customer success management and less time on working on those maintenance renewals, but it is a slightly different team of people than the ones that are going out, driving new customer sales and expansion.
Ryan Daniels
Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Larsen of BTIG. David, please go ahead.
David Larsen
Hi. Congratulations on a very good quarter and the continued momentum of the overall business. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about Edge and PatientSafe? I just remember, like years ago, PatientSafe Solutions, there was actually like a time that nurses and doctors would sort of hand off between each other to sort of ensure that there were no gaps in care. Can you maybe just talk about the actual product itself, what it does and the unique sort of value-add from the hospitalâs point of view with Edge? Thanks.
Brent Lang
Yes. Thanks, David. So I think youâre referring to the early founding of the company. Over the last several years, they had pivoted to be primarily focused on the clinical communication and collaboration space. So there is no longer any hardware component of the business. Itâs a cloud-based smartphone app thatâs really focused on clinical communication and deep integration in the electronic health record. They do continue to do some administration work, and there is some workflows that involve barcode scanning, but itâs entirely leveraging the camera thatâs part of an iPhone or other smartphone device. And because itâs cloud-based, it provides reduced administration levels and more flexibility even to sites that might not have the same level of IT resources. And part of the strategy that PatientSafe was applying before we acquired them was to create a solution that was very complementary to the work that the electronic health records were doing. So customers that have already made a big investment in one of the mobile apps from one of the EHR companies can still get a tremendous amount of value by pairing that with what weâre now referring to as the Edge solution. So it sort of leverages, for example, the texting functionality that might be built into the EHR app by adding more of the clinical workflow capabilities, and some of the voice capabilities, some of the clinical integrations and event-driven integrations. And so itâs more of a complementary piece that point alongside those customers that have already decided they are fairly committed to using the EHR mobile applications. But that was a pivot that the company did probably 3 or 4 years ago, and they had just begun rolling out this new solution over the last year or so once they put in here and work into it. And so by the time we made the acquisition, it was 100% software business sold on a subscription basis.
David Larsen
Great. Thanks very much. And then just one quick follow-up if I can. Can you maybe talk a bit about Kaiser? Was Kaiser already a client or not? And what region of Kaiser did you actually win and what did they buy? It seems like that would be a very substantial client?
Brent Lang
Yes. They are a very substantial client, David. We have had them as a customer, both on the Engage side as well as on the voice and messaging side as well as the badges for a number of years. They continue to expand a little bit region-by-region in different time frames. So what this was in Q2 was another large expansion order that included new groups of users and different facilities pretty much across various regions within Kaiser.
David Larsen
Great. Thanks so much. Congrats again.
Brent Lang
Thank you, David.
Operator
Our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Karan Juvekar
Hi. This is Karan Juvekar on for Meta. Thanks for the question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess just digging into the software versus device revenue and the upside there? I guess, is it difference in upside? Is it partly because of customer election differences? So for example, customers electing to have the platform as a smart Edge on their phone or some like that with the customer preference? I guess just triangulating the upside there or the difference in upside between software revenue and device revenue would be helpful?
Steve Anheier
Yes, great question. So the first thing Iâd say is, as weâre starting to see more large enterprise-wide bookings like the providence booking that Brent mentioned, which was the largest booking in the companyâs history. We are seeing higher percentage or proportion of the deals being software. For instance, that booking had a really strong engage element component to it. It did also have smart base, but we really want to be device agnostic and whether itâs on a smartphone or the badge and just really give the customer a full suite of options. And â but what Iâd say is software is our fastest-growing segment. It grew 76% in Q2. As we look at our backlog, itâs also healthy and the fastest-growing segment in our backlog. So, one of the key themes for this quarter was just the strength all around from bookings to backlog to revenue in our software business. And what weâre hearing from our sales force is a lot of these deals are being read by the software now.
Karan Juvekar
Got it. Thatâs helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Iris Long from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Iris Long
Hi, good afternoon, team. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a follow-up on the bookings number. It is quite strong from 9% organic growth over Q1. Iâm just wondering, given that this number now increased the impact from the acquisitions. Roughly whatâs the set of current bookings versus non-current? And then Iâm also wondering what portion of that booking is related to software. I know, Steve, that you kind of callout that software bookings were very strong. So Iâm just wondering if you can kind of help us to quantify that, what portion is related to software?
Steve Anheier
Yes. Hi, Iris. So what we can say is, if maybe we take a step back and just think about the key drivers of our business, and we just had excellent momentum in bookings, backlog, revenue and just itâs showing that the priority of our solution is elevating. Now getting specifically to your question, our total backlog and deferred revenue, which we report was $218 million, 71% year-over-year growth. When we take up the two acquisitions, which is EASE and PatientSafe over the last 12 months, itâs 45% growth, so still very healthy. We donât go into our split of our backlog of whatâs software versus whatâs hardware. What we can say is, and what we said on the script is that our software backlog is at a record high. And what thatâs very important is not only do we have really strong software revenue in the first half of the year, but our bookings replenish that revenue and backlog and even added to it to create a new high watermark for us. So hopefully, thatâs helpful context.
Brent Lang
The only thing that I would add is that you asked specifically about the acquired products and the magnitude of the software bookings from the acquired products was not substantial during the quarter. Most of the bookings was driven by our existing businesses.
Iris Long
Got it. Thatâs very helpful. Just a very quick follow-up, so for the EASE and the PatientSafe, those deals, are those typically within a year? Whatâs the contract lines like?
Brent Lang
Yes. Thatâs a good question. The contracts really vary. We have seen them from 1 to 5 years, but a typical contract, you see is 3 to 5 years is the time. And so that was one of the key points that we wanted to make sure was clear in the script that this backlog being added from our subscription business or the two acquisitions, has a longer time to roll out. So we look at that as very positive as it gives us more visibility and predictability into 2022 and beyond revenue.
Iris Long
Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital. Matt, please go ahead.
Matt Hewitt
Good afternoon. I'll echo everybody else and just say congratulations on a really strong quarter. The question for me is regarding the PatientSafe business. You recently added some smaller customers through that acquisition. Have you seen any early signs of success cross-selling that into your installed base? Thank you.
Brent Lang
Matt, thanks for the question. So I would say that weâre in the early days here. We only closed the transaction in May. So itâs still pretty early. What I would say is that as our sales organization has gone out and talk to our customer base and prospects, weâve gotten very favorable reviews. They are excited about the new functionality. They are interested in exploring the cloud option here. Many of them are evaluating the role that smartphones are going to play and also the role that the EHR based software is going to play. And so I think, in general, we got very positive responses. The sales cycle for these products is in the 9 to 12 to 18-month time frame. So I think itâs too early to know how itâs going to translate to new bookings. Weâre going to have to do the work, build the pipeline and close those deals once we get budget approvals, but I would say that the early returns based on the original outreach has been quite positive.
Matt Hewitt
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Polark from Baird. Michael, please go ahead.
Michael Polark
Hey, good evening. Two quick ones, if I can, perhaps for Steve. Can you quantify, Steve just the contribution from the two acquisitions to revenue in the quarter? Kind of to give us a flavor for what the organic growth rate was? Thatâs number one. And then number two is zooming out, winning a lot of business here, multiyear implementation cycles. Brent, Iâd be curious just for your assessment of your services organization, do you expect to have to add resources here over the next 6 to 18 months of some of these bigger multi-site deals start to rollout?
Steve Anheier
Yes, Michael, thanks. Good question. So from the acquisition, I characterize it as still very modest from a revenue increase. We â when we acquired PatientSafe back last quarter, we said they would have a $3 million full year revenue impact and we are still tracking to that number. So, very modest for the quarter and similar with EASE. However, you can see in the backlog that they did add approximately combined $34 million of backlog. So we see future growth in both EASE and PatientSafe because they are SaaS and will be in the cloud. Theyâll be in the subscription and support line in our revenue stream. For the quarter, that line grew 19% year-over-year. So we had a very healthy growth rate, and we continue to see and believe that will be one of our fastest growing revenue segment, but specifically to the quarter, a very modest impact from EASE and PatientSafe if you see at more of a longer term play.
Brent Lang
And Michael, to your second question about the services organization, we do anticipate needed to continue to grow those organizations. We are investing in customer success by bringing on more professional services resources. One thing that I would highlight is that the pandemic has really given us the opportunity to innovate in terms of how we deliver professional services, both on-site and remotely, and weâve invested in online tools that we can use to leverage to reduce the amount of travel and on-site work that needs to be done. So I would say that our overall level of efficiency has also gone up. But given our current utilization rates of the professional services team, we do anticipate adding additional head count within those groups, just in order to support the growth. So itâs an investment in our future.
Steve Anheier
Yes. And Michael, if you look at the service margins, they remain very healthy and hopefully, it was a bright spot that â the same community picked up was just our overall gross margin growth in the quarter was strong, driven by software.
Michael Polark
Fair to say that investment is considered in your â the second half of the year in the guidance?
Brent Lang
For sure, yes.
Steve Anheier
Yes, absolutely.
Michael Polark
Yes. Okay, thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis from SVB Leerink. Stephanie, please go ahead.
Stephanie Davis
Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question. I was hoping we could explore the Edge platform a little bit more and some of the use cases that are in development. Should we think about this more as a platform for physician facing tools? And where do you draw the line around things that fit into the physician facing to share a spirit influence as opposed to something youâd rather keep off the platform?
Brent Lang
You broke up a little bit, Stephanie. So Iâll try to address the question, and then maybe you can clarify if I donât address the point youâre giving after. The primary use cases for the Edge platform, our focus on acute care facility is similar to the way the traditional Vocera platform is. The bulk of their customer base there is acute care facilities. Although the workflows within those acute care facilities are more â some are more geared towards physicians who are on-site within those facilities. We also think based on the cloud nature of the product, that there is an opportunity to extend out to ambulatory and physician practices and areas outside the acute care environment. And the integration with EHR makes it ideal for some of those workflows and dynamics as well. Does that answer your question?
Stephanie Davis
So itâs helpful. What Iâm trying to get at is that it helps with the workflow, but this also gets you into a kind of a broader physician base that you historically have. So would you then want to branch out into some other areas of software that are more physician facing, such as decision support, stuff like that?
Brent Lang
Yes. I mean I think weâre at the stage of our companyâs growth where weâre looking for opportunities to expand our TAM. We do that both organically and inorganically. And many of the opportunities weâre looking at for M&A would add new TAM opportunities for us and some of the new products weâre introducing. If you think about the Alexa skill that we talked about earlier this year, some of the analytics work that weâre doing with new insights capabilities. These are expanding into new areas that we havenât traditionally been in. And the reality is weâve got an incredible platform reach where weâve literally got millions of end users carrying awareness of Vocera device and being able to use either the screen or the voices are face to access not just other people but data and information and clinical results. And we see this as an opportunity to grow over time to add a tremendous amount of new use cases to our platform.
Stephanie Davis
And should I think about â because you mentioned M&A first, is this more of a buy strategy as opposed and it will be a balance of both?
Brent Lang
Itâs both. Yes, I think we look at every opportunity in a build by our partner mindset. In some cases, we end up partnering with third-party solutions and integrate them in. In some cases, we build them internally. And in some cases, we decided that, that course of action is to actually make an acquisition. But it really depends on a lot of factors related to the market opportunity and the available competitive landscape and that kind of thing.
Steve Anheier
And Stephanie to add to that, our balance sheet is even stronger this year than last year at this time even after the two acquisitions as we said in the script, after the convertible note raise. And so, we have about $58 million more of cash than we did last year, it just gives us a lot of flexibility for the inorganic or organic growth rates in past we can take.
Stephanie Davis
Helpful. Thank you, team.
Brent Lang
Thanks, Stephanie.

Our next question comes from David Windley from Jefferies. David, please go ahead.
David Windley
Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, you had mentioned the importance of third and fourth quarter as it relates to kind of building the outlook for â22. And youâve also both emphasized the conversion software in the first half, but yet still record high backlog. How does the pipeline look behind that? How is that building? Is that also replenishing? And maybe specifically within that, how does the government pipeline looking as we sit here in the third quarter, which is typically strong for government? Thanks.
Steve Anheier
Sure. And so, you did pick up on that correctly. The third and fourth quarter are always important entering the next year. I think not to miss so that our record backlog in deferred revenue, as we said, gives us great visibility to 2021, which led to our guidance raise and the 16% top of the end growth. But as we said, it does give us more visibility at this time and since 2022. So we look to improve on that in Q3 and Q4. But we like where we sit right now for that. As far as the pipeline, it is something we monitor very closely, and we continue to see growth in our pipeline. And we look for â in many ways, we look at our pipeline, and how it rolls out the probability. But we really see broad-based strength. And the government, specifically, as you know, is usually a typically a really strong Q3. We think we will have another good second half of the year. We watch that closely. It can come down for the last week. So we donât want to make any concrete statements. But we continue to feel really good that we could take a step back on the government and just the long-term opportunity to continue to land and expand and ROIs becoming the facts of standard choice there. 
Brent Lang
The only thing I would add on top line is I continue to see the trend towards larger enterprise-wide deals. So the portion of the pipeline thatâs tied to these larger deals is definitely increasing. And at the trend weâve seen developing over the last several years, and weâre definitely seeing that continue to transition.
David Windley
Thanks for that. In regard to sales activity and sales cycle, certainly, weâre in a different place than we were more than a year ago when the pandemic first hit, but some increase in infection rates and things like that, fortunately, maybe not as much hospitalization. Iâm just â Iâm getting that, is there any impact at all in your ability to kind of maintain the attention of your client or prospective client counterparts in the sales cycle as we progress through the second half?
Brent Lang
I think we remain very much of a top priority. I think the increased focus, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks around safety in health care and reducing burnout amongst the nurses is continuing to be a really important aspect. The other thing that I would say is that while there is a lot of distraction and obviously, a lot of things going on in the hospital environment, we are seeing somewhat of a reduction in the level of bureaucrat decision-making processes. I think hospitals are recognizing that they need to streamline their own operations. And weâve seen situations where once they have been able to identify the funding, the decision-making process is maybe even a little quicker than it has been historically. And I donât know if thatâs a result of just them wanting to make sure that they are keeping as much of their resource available to focus on the pandemic and other health through equity related issues and therefore, kind of streamlining the overall decision-making processes a little bit.
David Windley
Thatâs interesting. Thanks. And then, Brent, you had mentioned in the past, I think, more at kind of a beta stage, but some attention and focus and investment in analytics as a product. Any update on that?
Brent Lang
Yes, itâs progressing nicely. Weâre learning a lot from the beta. This is obviously a new area for us. But I think an area youâll continue to see more and more focus from us over the coming quarters.
David Windley
Very good. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jessica Tassan from Piper Sandler. Jessica, please go ahead.
Jessica Tassan
Hi, thank you for taking my question. So I think you guys facilitated some emergency deployments during COVID. Weâre interested to note to the extent that those deployments are outside of your installed base, kind of how are they converting to permanent contracts? And have you sort of turned over every stone or do you have a significant amount of backlog of those emergency deployment with whom you have yet to engage and just any color maybe on the conversion rate you have experienced to date would be helpful? Thank you.
Brent Lang
Hey, Jess. So I think, in general, the way to think about this is that the temporary license key, which I think is what youâre referring to, that we started issuing in Q2 and Q3 of last year, have all, at this point, either been converted or had expired. So itâs not, there is no really additional overhang there. Weâve seen benefit from customers who saw the value of our solution. And once funding did become available, we hadnât made those conversions, but that was probably towards the end of last year. So it really hasnât been a dynamic for this year. I think the dynamic this year has been more around focusing on what they can do to reduce the level of stress and intention for the nurses, how can they free up more time to them and how can they make them safer to be able to deliver frontline care. But the emergency deployment dynamic is largely in the review here at this point.
Steve Anheier
Yes, Jess, that is a good question. Most of that was deployed by Q2 and expired in Q3. I would say the broader highlight would be that just the priority of our solution seems to be elevating, and weâre really seeing that come through our financial results. So maybe a broader enhanced need for clinical communication collaboration along with the battery or the hands-free device.
Jessica Tassan
Got it. Thatâs helpful. And if I could just follow-up with them, do you have any engagement metrics on the Engage for iPhone app? Maybe what percent of clinicians with access have downloaded and then what percent you did and how often? And thanks.
Brent Lang
I donât know that we have any statistics specifically around that. As I mentioned earlier, Engage is becoming a much more important part of the overall sales process. If you roll the clock back several years, the typical sales pattern would be that the customer would buy the communications aspect, voice and messaging first and then they would think about clinical integration, almost as an afterthought, maybe at a subsequent deployment. What weâre seeing in the marketplace today is that many of these large strategic deals are actually being driven through Engage and with the clinical workflow aspect being the strategic driver as a way of reducing cognitive overload and clinician payout. And then the communication piece is kind of bundled to meet that. We obviously can see utilization within our customer base, but I donât know specifically about your question as it relates to the app.

Our next question comes from Gene Mannheimer from Colliers Securities. Gene, please go ahead.
Gene Mannheimer
Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on a great quarter in first half. My question, I think, relates to the last one. And you talked guys about how device revenue was down year-over-year, I think about 5% due to that tough comp that was COVID related. So the question is, how much of those emergency deployments were in last yearâs quarter. If you could quantify that, that would help us get more of an apples-to-apples comparison on device sales? Thank you.
Steve Anheier
Yes, Gene. Hopefully, we can give some color around there. So as you said, device revenue was down in the quarter on a very tough compare. On the first half of the year basis, however, it is up year-over-year and still represents approximately 30% of our total revenue, so still significant. The thing I can give you is that backlog â device backlog is up significantly year-over-year. So that bodes well for the second half of this year. But we didnât break out specifically last year, the device from COVID versus non-COVID. But hopefully, those other metrics are helpful.
Gene Mannheimer
Thatâs great. Thank you.
