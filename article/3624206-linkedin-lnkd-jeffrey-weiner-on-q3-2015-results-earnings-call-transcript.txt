Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the LinkedIn Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available for replay from the Investor Relations' section of LinkedIn's website following this call.
I will now turn the call over to Matt Sonefeldt. Thank you. Sir, you may now begin.
Matt Sonefeldt - Head-Investor Relations
Good afternoon. Welcome to LinkedIn's third quarter of 2015 results call. Joining me today to discuss our results are CEO, Jeff Weiner, and CFO, Steve Sordello.
Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, management will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include statements relating to expected member growth and engagement, our product offerings including mobile and our product deployment process, results of our R&D efforts, revenue including revenue growth rates, adjusted EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, share dilution, taxes, the product mix between online and field sales, churn rate and expenses.
Actual results may materially differ from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. A discussion of risks and uncertainties related to our business is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, the section entitled Risk Factors in our Quarterly and Annual Reports, and we refer you to these filings.
Also, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables in our earnings release. This conference call is also being broadcast on the web and is available through the Investor Relations' section of the LinkedIn website.
With that, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Jeff Weiner.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Matt, and welcome to today's conference call. I'll start by summarizing the operating results for the third quarter of 2015, and I'll recap some of the key milestones that demonstrate the execution of our strategy. I'll then turn it over to Steve for a more detailed look at the numbers and outlook.
Q3 was a strong quarter for LinkedIn. Our member-facing product pipeline has never been stronger, and recent roll-outs are driving continued positive engagement trends. In terms of our business lines, Talent Solutions performed well, while Marketing Solutions remained stable. We also made good progress in Sales Solutions and lynda.com, our more nascent opportunities, which are future growth drivers for the company.
For Q3, overall revenues grew 37% to $780 million. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $208 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.78.
Q3 cumulative members grew 20% to 396 million, and last week reached the 400 million member milestone. Unique visiting members grew 11% to an average of 100 million per month, and member page views grew 33%. This has yielded 20% year-over-year growth in page views per unique visiting member, continuing a pattern of accelerated growth throughout 2015.
This is in part a result of placing more emphasis on quality engagement for our members and less on transactional engagement generated by emails. Mobile continues to grow at double the rate of overall member activity, and now represents 55% of all traffic to LinkedIn.
LinkedIn's value proposition is simple; connect to opportunity. For our members, this means three things: connect to your professional world; stay informed through professional news and knowledge; and get hired and build your career. In 2015, we made substantial progress on delivering these value propositions. Here are a few highlights of the progress we've made since our last earnings call.
We continued to expand the LinkedIn network globally. Since our last call, China has continued to accelerate the absolute number of signups, and now has more than 13 million members, up more than 3x since early 2014 when we launched our local language version. Though still early, we are also seeing strong sign-ups and engagement for Chitu, our first professional networking app designed specifically for the Chinese market.
In Q3, we replaced the traditional Inbox with Messaging, a more lightweight and casual communications interface. While still early, we have already seen a double-digit percentage increase in the number of messages sent between members, and a significant lift in one day reply rates. Messaging is already available for our English-language members, and we are in the process of completing the roll out globally.
Finally, a few weeks ago, we previewed the next generation of LinkedIn's mobile flagship experience. This new app was developed mobile first; does fewer things better; and is faster, simpler, and more personalized. It's structured around five key pillars: The Feed; Profile; My Network; Messaging; and Search, and will launch next month. In 2016, these pillars will also serve as the foundation for the ongoing evolution of our desktop site.
Connecting our members to relevant news, knowledge, and skills is another strategic priority integral to creating member value. Our publishing platform is central to this effort. In Q3, the number of long-form posts published per week reached more than 150,000. We also recently added the ability to post long-form content in more languages, including Portuguese, French, and German. And last week, we welcomed Oprah Winfrey to the Influencer platform.
Lastly, helping members get hired is one of the fastest growing areas of engagement on LinkedIn. We continue to increase the scale of jobs on the platform, with more than four million active job listings today, compared to roughly one million a year ago. Monthly job page views were up over 90% year-over-year in September, and we have seen a 75% year-over-year increase in applications to those jobs.
Creating value for our members enables us to transform the way our customers hire, market, and sell on a global basis through our three diverse product lines. In Q3, Talent Solutions grew 46% to $502 million, inclusive of Learning & Development revenue from lynda.com; Marketing Solutions was up 28% to $140 million; and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions, increased 21% to $138 million.
For Talent Solutions, Q3 saw continued strength stemming from the sales force realignment done at the start of the year. We've been investing in Talent Solutions R&D throughout 2015, and we now have the most powerful pipeline of new products for recruiters in our history.
At Talent Connect, we announced two of our biggest; LinkedIn Referrals, and a completely revamped Recruiter platform. Both products enable employers to more easily leverage better data and employee relationships to hire the right talent faster. Referrals is expected to launch in November, and the new Recruiter early next year.
The ongoing integration of lynda.com progressed in Q3 with the launch of new LinkedIn Influencer courses and new features for our members. And the enterprise business remains strong; last quarter, lynda signed an existing customer to multi-year renewal for more than $4 million, the largest deal in its history.
For Marketing Solutions, we continue to create a more scalable business and become the most effective platform for marketers to engage professionals. In Q3, Sponsored Updates accounted for approximately half of all Marketing Solutions revenue, and continues to grow in excess of 100% year-over-year.
In Sales Solutions, we launched a new Sales Navigator homepage with integrated Social Selling Index data. Sales Navigator customer satisfaction continued to increase during Q3. In addition, the field sales team is seeing early success with a land-and-expand go-to-market strategy.
Additionally, just this week, LinkedIn and EY agreed on the largest single deal in our history, leveraging Sales Navigator as a platform, as well as a go-to-market alliance to help accelerate our respective growth in the business-to-business enterprise market.
Our collaboration with EY will enable us to leverage EY's extensive capabilities, footprint and global reach. Together, we'll help companies develop deeper and more trusted customer relationships through social and data analytics. We believe this strategic relationship will lead to collaboration and co-creation of solutions, generating opportunities for both of our organizations.
Lastly, LinkedIn @Work, our newest value proposition for our customers, continues to gain momentum. In August, we launched LinkedIn Lookup, a standalone app that allows members to find new contact co-workers. And in September, we announced the general availability of LinkedIn Elevate to all large enterprises. Nearly all of the pilot partners up for renewal have purchased the product.
As we think about 2016, we expect to accelerate our focus on how we integrate all of these assets to help enterprises hire, market, and sell by using LinkedIn to connect to opportunity.
Finally, a word about our Talent, our most important operating priority. In Q3, we made strong progress on hiring senior level engineering talent, as well as hiring a record number of engineering managers, both of which are key objectives for us in 2015. This traction enables us to scale faster and deliver our product roadmap more effectively.
And now, I'll turn it over to Steve for a deeper dive into our operating metrics and financials.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks, Jeff. Today, I will discuss growth rates on a year-over-year basis unless indicated otherwise, and non-GAAP financial measures exclude items such as stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles, and the tax impacts of these adjustments.
During the third quarter, we demonstrated strong financial performance, and made significant progress on our long-term product roadmap for both members and customers.
With respect to revenue, in Q3, we generated $780 million in total sales, an increase of 37% year-over-year, or 43% on a constant currency basis. While lynda contributed approximately $41 million to revenue in its first full quarter post acquisition, the vast majority of our outperformance relative to guidance was driven by the core business.
Talent Solutions, showed strong performance, with revenue of $502 million growing 46% year-over-year, and represented 64% of sales versus 61% last year.
Within our Hiring business, revenue grew 34% year-over-year, or 39% on a constant currency basis.
In our field sales channel, we saw nice year-over-year improvement in both churn and the net ratio. We also saw steady growth in new customers as we approach nearly 40,000 enterprise accounts under contract.
Our online channel is where small companies turn to LinkedIn on a self-serve basis, and in Q3 showed solid growth. All three products lines, Recruiter Lite, Job Seeker, and Online Jobs, exhibited strength, the result of an upgraded customer experience.
Learning & Development contributed $41 million in the first full quarter following the lynda acquisition. Our product and go-to-market teams have focused on growing lynda's existing business, and we plan to begin launching more integrated consumer and enterprise products in 2016.
Marketing Solutions grew 28% to $140 million, or 34% on a constant currency basis, and represented 18% of revenue versus 19% last year.
Sponsored Updates maintained strong momentum, and continues to be the driver of our advertising business. Sponsored Updates represented nearly 50% of marketing revenue, and once again grew in excess of 100% year-over-year. Recent growth has been driven by increased customer demand, aided by the launch of our new online campaign manager.
As expected, CPM-based premium display continued to face secular-driven headwinds. We experienced similar trends as compared with last quarter with revenue decreasing in the mid-30% range year-over-year. Premium display now represents approximately 15% of Marketing Solutions mix, compared with approximately 30% last year. As Sponsored Updates continues to grow, we expect premium display to contribute a smaller portion of our long-term mix.
We also remained focused on the B2B opportunity and continued to evolve our recently launched LinkedIn Lead Accelerator product. During the quarter, we saw churn decrease due to the emphasis on annual versus quarterly campaigns.
Premium Subscriptions grew to $138 million, up 21% year-over-year, or 26% growth on a constant currency basis, and contributed 18% of revenue versus 20% last year.
Sales Solutions remained the faster growing component of Premium, now representing over one-third of this revenue line. We continue to make both product and go-to-market gains as this new business enters its second year.
In addition to introducing Sales Navigator to new enterprise customers like EY, we continue to gain traction with our land-and-expand play book. Microsoft provides a terrific example, having grown their social selling practice from 15 Sales Navigator seats to more than 3,000 in less than two years. In the process, their social selling reps have seen nearly a 40% increase in productivity when compared to traditional sales reps.
General subscriptions still represent the majority of Premium revenue, though since launching the new on-boarding experience late last year, we continue to see the individual subscriber mix shift towards Job Seeker and Recruiter Lite, which are both reported within Talent Solutions.
In terms of geography, revenue generated outside the U.S. represented 38% of overall revenue versus 40% last year, or 40% this quarter on a constant currency basis. EMEA performed well showing acceleration during the quarter, and APAC showed nice improvement as well.
By channel, field sales contributed 62% of revenue versus 60% last year. While a smaller portion of our overall revenue, higher margin online products performed well during the quarter, especially within Talent Solutions.
Moving to the non-GAAP financials, Adjusted EBITDA was $208 million, a 27% margin. This exceeded our expectations with revenue driving over half of our outperformance, the vast majority coming from the core business, with especially strong performance from high-margin online products. The remainder of over performance was tied to lower expenses oriented across several areas; including lynda and facilities.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $118 million, while stock compensation was $127 million. GAAP net loss was $41 million, resulting in a $0.31 loss per share, compared to a loss of $4 million and $0.03 last year. Non-GAAP net income was $103 million, resulting in earnings of $0.78 per share, compared with $66 million and $0.52 last year.
The balance sheet remains well positioned with $3.1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Operating cash flow was $240 million versus $181 million a year ago, and free cash flow was $73 million, up from $61 million last year. Note, CapEx increased meaningfully quarter-over-quarter as we began the buildout of our third self-managed data center.
I will end the call with guidance for the fourth quarter and an updated outlook for 2015. For the fourth quarter: we expect revenue between $845 million and $850 million, 32% growth at the midpoint; we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $210 million, a 25% margin; and for non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $0.74 per share.
For the full-year: we expect revenue between approximately $2.975 billion and $2.98 billion, representing growth of 34% year-over-year; this represents an increase of $35 million to $40 million compared to prior guidance; the majority of the out performance was driven by Q3 results, with the remaining increase from a slight up-tick to our Q4 outlook for both our core business and lynda; we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $740 million, a 25% margin; and this represents an increase of approximately $75 million compared to prior guidance, with Q3 out performance of about $60 million; for non-GAAP EPS, we expect approximately $2.63 per share.
I'd like to provide some additional context on guidance. With respect to revenue in the fourth quarter: within Hiring, Learning & Development, and Sales Solutions, we expect healthy underlying trends to continue, albeit compared against a particularly strong Q4 in 2014; for Marketing Solutions specifically, we expect Sponsored Updates to continue to drive our growth, offsetting consistent secular display headwinds and our first full quarter with year-over-year comparison post the Bizo acquisition last year; we also expect an approximately 5% growth headwind relative to FX, unchanged from our previous Q4 outlook.
With respect to adjusted EBITDA guidance: we expect greater expense impact from a heavier quarter of sales rep hiring; greater field sales seasonality after a particularly strong online quarter in Q3; and ongoing investments in key areas, including China and our member platform, as we launch the new flagship app.
Lastly, I want to touch on how improvements to member-facing products will impact engagement metrics in the short-term: first, we are streamlining our new mobile app thereby decreasing the number of page views necessary to deliver a high quality experience. Specifically, more intuitive tabbed browsing replaces a dedicated navigation page, creating more seamless interaction; and second, we continue to remove emails and other transactional pages that generate lower value engagement to the site. This creates a better experience and long-term value for members, but will have a short-term impact on page view growth, especially when compared against a heavy transactional period like Q4 2014.
Both initiatives reflect our commitment and investment in the member platform. Throughout 2015, we have increasingly seen deeper member interaction across our core value propositions, including greater than 90% growth in traffic to jobs, and publishing content growing two times faster than the overall site. We look forward to sharing continued progress as we further innovate on our member platform.
Additional guidance incorporates: depreciation of approximately $78 million in Q4 and $281 million for the full-year, with fourth quarter amortization of approximately $47 million and $135 million for the full-year; stock-based compensation of approximately $135 million for Q4 and approximately $510 million for the full-year; other expense of approximately $16 million for Q4 and $57 million for the full-year, including GAAP-only convertible accretion of $12 million in Q4 and $46 million for the full-year; and in addition in Q4, we are evaluating and may adopt new accounting guidance with regard to our China JV, which increases the volatility of non-cash other expense; a Non-GAAP tax rate of 23% for Q4 and the full-year; CapEx of approximately 20% of revenue for the full-year, reflecting the second half data center build-out.
And for share count: on a GAAP basis, we expect 132 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q4, and an average of 129 million for the full-year; and on a non-GAAP basis, we expect 134 million fully diluted weighted shares in Q4 and an average of 131 million for the full-year.
In closing, LinkedIn delivered strong performance during the third quarter. As we end the year, our focus remains on the long-term realization of our mission and vision. This is an exciting period for LinkedIn as our product innovation takes root with complete re-designs of both our flagship mobile app and Recruiter platform. We will continue to focus on areas that drive the greatest long-term business impact, while scaling our platform to create the most value for our members and customers.
Thank you for your time, and we'll now take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from Tom White with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Tom White - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. Hiring revenues per enterprise customer, I think it was up around 1%. Can you disclose what that was FX-neutral? And, I know you guys don't manage the business to that metric, but any color you can sort of give us on how to think about ARPU trends going forward, just given the customer and product mix shifts?
And then, just quickly, lynda, I think I heard something about launching more enterprise products in 2016. Any more color you can share there? Is that just new courses or new verticals? Or, is that new tools and functionality for enterprises? Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, all of our underlying metrics in the Hiring business were strong in the quarter. In particular, on ARPU, we did see an uptick, despite adding a healthy number of new customers.
On an FX-adjusted basis, it's actually magnified. So, we have about 1%, up about 5% on an FX-adjusted basis. I think the way that we're thinking about pricing over the long-term, you know, we have a very much land-and-expand approach.
And so, when you think about ARPU, it's always a tension of customer growth versus selling deeper into accounts. And I think, we kind of had the best of both worlds in terms of healthy growth in customer accounts, and maintaining record levels of ARPU.
And I think going forward, that land-and-expand approach is going to continue. We've had successful price increases in the past, and we've had â which is a nominal component of the increase in ARPU; the vast majority is selling deeper into accounts.
And as you know, we've recently announced some additional functionality for areas like Recruiter, which should add more value, and a product called Referrals, which makes Recruiter more sticky in a lot of ways as well. So, our strategy is land-and-expand, but we feel good about the position we're in relative to the pricing.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
With regard to the lynda question and lynda for the enterprise, one of the things we were most excited about, when we were initially thinking about the acquisition was the marriage of lynda's world-class coursework and the catalog with our go-to-market ability and tens of thousands of enterprise customers.
So, one of the first things we said about doing was validating potential changes to the roadmap and the evolution of that roadmap. You asked specifically, could that take the form of new courses or new verticals? Both of those things are possible, and another potential scenario is to start to think about lynda more as a platform, where enterprises that have already created their own courses, their own knowledge ware, would be able to leverage our infrastructure and our assets to improve the way that their employees are learning and developing. So, we continue to be very excited about the enterprise opportunity, and we're going to continue to develop that roadmap going forward.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mark S. Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Two questions, Steve. I know earlier this year, you had some sales force productivity challenges. Do you feel like you're back on par? You were back on par in the September quarter? Or, do you think that's still a recovery that takes a little longer?
And then, Jeff, the detail you pointed out earlier on the rising engagement, the 20% growth in page views per user. Just a little color on what areas are really driving that increase that almost accelerating growth and engagement?
And, when do we start seeing that really show up in Marketing Solutions? It seems like an obvious monetization opportunity, yet, there's this disconnect between its acceleration and engagement and a slowdown into Marketing Solutions. Is that just a lag that will close? Thanks a lot.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, Mark, in terms of the re-segmentation that was completed in Q1, obviously we talked about that having a kind of shorter-term impact in that particular quarter, mainly tied to add-ons, and we feel like we are through that. And actually benefited as we went into Q3, in terms of execution relative to Q1 and Q2, when we were coming out of the phase. So, we feel like the re-segmentation is behind us, and we're set up well vis-Ã -vis the customer opportunity.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
With regard to the 20% year-over-year increase in page views per unique, part of that is our greater focus on the quality of the visit and the quality of the unique. So, we're de-emphasizing more transactional flows, where people could potentially click on a link common and bounce out of the site, in favor of really honing in our value propositions and ensuring that people are getting value from the site. And that's driving much healthier organic engagement on a per unique basis for those folks that are visiting LinkedIn that way.
In terms of the specific products that are helping to drive the dynamic, certainly the publishing platform continues to generate traction. As we alluded to earlier, we've seen material acceleration in year-over-year growth for our jobs site, our jobs application, not only manifesting itself in terms of page views, but more importantly, in terms of applications for jobs. And we also track the extent to which we're successful in helping people get hired, which is the ultimate realization of that value proposition.
I think the ongoing transition to greater mobile engagement, versus desktop engagement, is certainly helping to drive that. We've seen traction in certain markets, like China, that will help to drive that. But I think all of those things play a role and factor into it.
In terms of when you would see that really manifested in our Marketing Solutions growth, I think you've got â as we've alluded to on a number of occasions, you've got these secular headwinds, with regard to display.
That said, our native advertising product, Sponsored Updates, continues to be our fastest growing product at scale, triple-digit growth last quarter. We're encouraged by the ongoing growth, their ongoing investment in improving Sponsored Updates; and even more importantly, the return on investment for our advertiser customers.
And we're also continuing to invest in LinkedIn Lead Accelerator, and how we can generate value, full funnel value, from the top of the funnel, all the way down, leveraging a product like native advertising and Sponsored Updates, as well as some other products we continue to invest in.

Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, one on the small and medium-size business space. What are you seeing as more SMBs adopt the Talent Solutions product set in terms of their spend? In terms of how they onboard with the platform? What that might mean for customer growth, longer term?
And then, a second question on China. I appreciate the update on member growth you're seeing there. Wanted to know if we could understand a little bit better path to monetization and some of the headwinds to OpEx as you invest against the China opportunity. Thanks.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, with regard to the SMB opportunity, in terms of Talent Solutions, we recently announced some really exciting innovations with regard to Recruiter. Really, the biggest jump in terms of innovation on that platform since it was originally launched over seven years ago.
And the team has really rolled up its sleeves in terms of understanding, not just how we can create value for Recruiters, but also for Hiring managers and small business leaders, folks that are not necessarily in the market to hire a recruiter, per se, but are doing the recruiting on their own. They have a different set of needs. So, our Recruiter product is going to create a simplified Search mechanism, a more intuitive mechanism for doing those searches. We're encouraged by that, and we're looking forward to rolling out that new Recruiter product in Q1.
With regard to China, we've got good momentum there. And though it's a challenging market, it certainly has exceeded our expectations thus far, both in terms of our global platform and localization of our global platform, where we saw growth in membership from 4 million last February to north of 13 million most recently.
And then with regard to our standalone mobile first Chinese-only application, which we call Chitu, Derek and the team continue to do very strong work, in terms of understanding the market, and how we create value there. So, we've been pleased with the results thus far.
In terms of monetization, as we've said from day one, that is a secondary priority right now. We first want to focus on the member value propositions. We want to focus on growth and engagement, healthy, organic engagement, making sure that we are delivering value for our Chinese members.
We are seeing good traction from a customer perspective. Talent Solutions continues to make progress, but that is not the priority right now, and so we're going to continue to focus on growth and engagement. And that said, I do think there's some good traction, some meaningful opportunities there on the monetization front.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open.
Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With regards to just the membership growth and the member page view growth, can you talk a little bit about how much of that is international versus U.S.?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, international represents about 70% of overall member base against a revenue level of 38%. So, it is growing at a faster clip. It's about 80% of our net adds. And as Jeff just alluded to, China is actually more recently a more material portion of that being our fastest growing country in recent periods on an absolute basis.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would also add, in addition to the opportunity in China, we don't talk about it as much. There's a lot of focus on China for good reason, but India continues to be our second largest market in terms of cumulative members added to-date.
And we're seeing good traction there as we continue to focus on specific cohorts. Most recently, the addition of jobs liquidity on our site creates more value for students just graduating looking for their first job. And there's a big population, a big addressable opportunity there. And there's some exciting stuff we're working on that we'll really localize for the Indian market in a not dissimilar way from the way we've been able to localize and have some success in China. So, we're looking forward to continuing to realize that opportunity going forward.

Your next question comes from Kerry Rice with Needham. Your line is open.
Kerry Rice - Needham & Co. LLC
Thanks a lot. Steve, maybe you can remind us what you gave as far as guidance for lynda? I think you said either when you acquired them you updated that for the second half of the year. I thought it was around $75 million. Seems like lynda was pretty strong in Q3. Do you have any updates on â or maybe seasonality in Q4 that we would suspect may change what you previously guided for on that?
And then, the second question maybe for Jeff, when you think about the EY alliance, it sounds like they license Sales Navigator, and they're also selling that. As they sell it how do we think about the monetization and timing of that, if any? Any more details there? Thank you.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, in terms of lynda, last quarter, we had previously guided to about $90 million for the full-year. We're now expecting around $100 million contribution from lynda. Q3 came in at roughly $40 million â a little over $40 million â $41 million in revenue, which we were a little bit back-end loaded in terms of the guidance, so we're expecting a little more muted over-performance in Q4. So, that extra $10 million; $6 million in Q3 and $4 million in Q4, roughly, in terms of over-performance.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
In terms of EY, very excited about today's partnership that we announced, largest single deal in our history across any of our business lines or product lines. Sales Navigator will be foundational to this, but certainly won't be exclusive to the deal on a going forward basis. And Sales Navigator will really be used as a platform, where EY and LinkedIn can partner together to leverage relationship assets, to leverage data, and truly connect not only partners within EY, but also EY with its alumni network. It's got a huge alumni network that's capable of generating value.
And then, of course, EY's clients. And EY can start to generate best demonstrated practices that can be shared with those clients. And part of the uniqueness to the deal for us, and one of the things that we're most looking forward to is the way in which we can then leverage that unique perspective lens and those insights and feed those back into our platform for connecting the enterprise to opportunity. So, very excited about the deal, and we're looking forward to getting started.

Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Thanks. So, Jeff, is the demonstration of ROI for Sales Navigator fairly straightforward for your prospective clients at this point? And, is the customer demand already there? Or, do you still feel like you have to convince a lot of potential clients of the benefits of what this thing can do? Thanks.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think the ROI is there. The more we talk to customers, the more we're hearing case study after case study about much higher yields, greater efficacy, effectiveness in terms of how sales forces are able to benefit from identifying the right prospect, engaging with those prospects, and ultimately, it's about closing the deal.
We're seeing synergies with some of our Marketing Solutions products in terms of identifying those prospects and getting them into the top of the funnel. All of that said, the more we can quantify the return on investment, I think the more attractive the product is going to be, and that's something that we're going to continue to invest in, and we have a team dedicated to doing that. And we're looking forward to seeing the results that we're going to be able to generate there.

Your next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to drill down more on the hiring business. And, in particular, can you guys talk just about how the operational improvements around the sales force changes, how that's playing out? And in particular, if you could help parse out the Recruiter business versus job postings and recruitment media perhaps from a growth perspective? And then, also, if you can give some more detail on Referrals and how that's going to be priced going forward? Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. The rationale for doing the re-segmentation was to get better aligned with our customers in terms of go-to-market, as our customer base has expanded over the years. And so, the support structure and relationship is in, I think, a more ongoing favorable alignment today than it was in Q1.
And what that helps with is, you know, driving more deeper relationships, and I think that's what's shown, last couple of quarters where we've seen the net ratio increase on a year-on-year basis, that's add-ons and renewals, net of churn, and we've seen churn decline on a year-on-year basis. And so we feel like we have some good momentum. And this was pretty much a one-time adjustment. Obviously, we took on a lot in that first quarter.
In terms of the mix of the businesses, not a lot of shifting; still roughly half is Recruiter, 25 recruitment media and 25% job slots of the overall field business. But we did see particular strength on the online side within Talent Solutions in quarter, which also tied to the margin being stronger. And that was across Recruiter Lite jobs, job postings, and the other products that we have. So, we saw a particular strength in the online business within Talent Solutions.

Your next question comes from Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Justin T. Patterson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi. Great. Thank you very much. So, if I look at margins for the quarter, we obviously had a very nice recovery. Does that imply that we're through the bulk of the purchase price accounting headwind from lynda?
And then, secondly, as we look to 2016, you've talked a lot about product expansion, product investment here. How should we think about that in the context of just investment loads with that? Obviously, it's been a very investment-heavy year for LinkedIn. Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, in terms of the accounting implications, with lynda this year, the top line is impacted by the write-down of deferred revenue, about $8 million in Q3, expecting about $5 million to $6 million in Q4, and another $5 million to $6 million for the first part of next year. So, that's really â there's a few other one-time expense items, but they're in the single-digit millions at this point.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
With regard to R&D investment, you're right; this was a big year of investment for us. A lot of foundational work going on in terms of identifying the right value propositions, getting more focused, clearly delineating between what we refer to internally as platform capabilities versus application capabilities, leveraging that technology.
And we're going to start to see â you've already started to see the rate of new products accelerate. It's going to continue to do so over the next several weeks. We're going to introduce into beta, our flagship, a reimagined version of our mobile flagship application. So, we're really encouraged by that.
As I mentioned earlier, there's some great innovation happening within Talent Solutions, our Recruiter product, the lynda roadmap. It's really happening across the board. And so, I don't know that we will see the same level of investment on a going forward basis. I think we're going to be able to leverage a lot of the investment that was made this year. Obviously, we're going continue to bring on a world-class engineering team and continue to add there.
From a capital equipment perspective, which obviously goes hand-in-hand as we continue to scale, we'll continue to build out our global footprint and make sure that we can push our bits as close as possible to our end users.

Your next question comes from the line of Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Arvind Bhatia, your line is open.
Your next question comes from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Youssef H. Squali - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. Thank you very much. Two quick questions. First, Jeff, on the new mobile experience. Can you help us just understand how maybe it differs from what you're offering today? And, if there are any additional key metrics that you'll be tracking to gauge the success of it after it launches?
And then, Steve, if my math is correct, if I look at your Q4 revenue guidance, it basically implies growth in the low-30%, excuse me. And, if I take the comment you just made about lynda's contribution in the fourth quarter that would imply core growing in the mid-20%, if you ex-out lynda. So, I think you also said that the vast majority of the outperformance this quarter was from core? So, just how do you reconcile the two? Thanks.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'll start with the new mobile application for flagship. This application was built mobile first as opposed to on a previous flagship application, which to some extent was porting over some of our desktop functionality. And over time, we kept adding more and more products and services, and you can kind of feel that in the application. So we asked ourselves, how would we build this if we could build it from scratch? So, it's mobile first. It's going to be more responsive. It's going to be smarter in terms of personalization. It's certainly going to be faster in terms of performance. It's more intuitive. It's far more seamless. So you're going to have a far more integrated application that does fewer things better.
And we're excited about the five pillars of that application, starting with the home-page and the home-screen, which is going to be feed-oriented. That's going to help our members to stay informed. Then there's Me; there's Messaging, our newly introduced messaging capability; My Network, which enables you to not only build your network, but also nurture those relationships over time; and our most intelligent, most responsive Search results and search engine to-date.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. Youssef, in terms of the results and guidance, yeah, for Q3, when you look at the top line view, it was just a little over $30 million. About $25 million or so, $26 million, of that was the core business. So, we had a very strong quarter in the core business, as well as lynda to a lesser extent.
In terms of the guidance, yes, correct, we are looking, when we think about each of the lines of business, we expect the Hiring component to continue to grow. It's growing off a larger base, so we do expect some decel there.
On Marketing Solutions, we are overlapping the first quarter where we had Bizo for the full quarter last year, which was about $16 million in revenue last year in that business. And as we spoke about, the display headwinds are still present.
And then I'd say for the other businesses, they just continue to build. I think one other factor â a couple other factors. One is Q4 was a particularly strong quarter last year, pretty much across-the-board. I'd say particularly in Marketing Solutions. And then we're also impacted on a year-over-year basis by the FX, which is still about a five-point headwind to our growth. So, all those factors â and that's mainly touching the core, because most of lynda is domestic.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Youssef, I wanted to also circle back on the second part of your first question, which was key metrics to keep an eye on with the new flagship application. It's not so much key metrics, but as Steve mentioned earlier in the call, by virtue of taking a more integrated approach, we're going with five tabs across those five pillars that I mentioned, versus a separate standalone navigation screen.
So, without that navigation screen in place, people won't need to take that extra step. Those were generating page views. Those page views weren't necessarily generating incremental value; they just kind of got in the way, it just created friction within the application. So, we think we've created better member experience, but you may see that show up in terms of the page views.

Your next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Steve, I just wanted to follow-up on one of your comments about Lead Accelerator, and you noted that churn dropped as more customers moved to annual campaigns from quarterly campaigns and that makes a lot of sense why churn would drop for that reason. But, could you give us sort of the perspective from the client? Are they getting more comfortable with it and moving from experimenting with it to really tucking in and making it part of their marketing program? Or, is there something different than that happening?
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, I'll start, and Jeff can add. I think overall last quarter, we made the decision to kind of do a refocus on larger accounts and the go-to-market and shifting more to annual where they can have a longer time period to evaluate the product, and I think that's where we're starting to see â obviously, when you make a move like that, you're more focused, you're likely to start to see higher renewal rates and we are seeing success there. So, I think that's the main driver. Jeff...?
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Not much more to add. I think the team continues to get focused on the right addressable customers and the right addressable opportunities. It is a full-funnel product and so we're not just focused on people working their way down the funnel, but we think there's some interesting opportunities at the top of the funnel as well, integration opportunities with regard to other parts of our business.
As we've alluded to in the past, we think there's real synergy with Sales Solutions and we want to integrate the success that we're having with Sponsored Updates as much as possible. So, seeing some good signs, and I think the more focused we get on the customers that can generate the highest â or higher ROIs, the better it will be.

Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first on Talent Solutions I think it was the first quarter of this year, where you'd mentioned it's going to be difficult to accelerate this business, given how big it is, yet here we are. Any specific products or customer segments or industries or regions that you'd call out and say these are over-delivering relative to what we thought earlier in the year? And, how we think about the sustainability of those areas?
And then, the second one on lynda. Could you just help us understand lynda's EBITDA contribution in 3Q and then the fourth quarter, and how you think about lynda margins as we go into next year? Thanks.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. In terms of the acceleration in the quarter, we had, like I said, pretty strong metrics across the board that have built from Q2 related to acquisition and renewal rates and add-ons, and I think that building off particularly a Q1, you get some sort of bump resulting out of that.
We also saw a kind of a re-acceleration in Europe, in particular, in this quarter. I think some of that was due to focus and drove some of that success, but that was a region, in particular, that we saw strength in Talent Solutions.
In terms of the EBITDA for lynda, the way, I would describe it is this year, I would call it as a dilutive element to our margin structure; next year, more of a build; and then the following year, more accretive. This is a business that has kind of had a modest negative EBITDA margin so far for us. It performed better than we had earlier anticipated. So, that's the way I would describe it. We're viewing the build-out of lynda on a long-term basis.
On the consumer side, really starting now to take the quality content they have â and match it with the data and scale and distribution that we have. And then, on the enterprise side, really starting to pilot some of the go-to-market capabilities against our 40,000 accounts, of which there isn't a lot of overlap. So, we're really trying to make sure that we manage this business in the right way as we build it. So, from a margin, that's how I would think about it, in terms of impact against LinkedIn's overall margin.

Your last question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you a couple of things. I noticed that deferred revenue usually decreases a little bit in the third quarter, maybe explain that? And how much of lynda was in the deferred revenue balance?
And then, maybe one to Jeff, as you look at the ratio of visiting members to total members, it continues to shrink a little bit and now visiting members are growing around 11%. I know it's a tougher year-over-year comp, but how do you think about that? And, is that one of the goals to get the visiting members up each month? Thank you.
Steven J. Sordello - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. On the deferred revenue side, about $64 million is from lynda, which is up from the high-$50 millions last quarter, $57 million, $58 million. In terms of deferred revenue, I think, pretty consistent performance. A couple of factors that are driving deferred revenue; one is we are signing more monthly deals with the kind of new onboarding process since we released that late last year. So, it shifted some of the annual mix to monthly for our subscription products.
And then particularly on the international side, we've had more customers move to quarterly billing from annual. So, there's been a little bit of mix on the billing side that that's impacted deferred revenue, but, for the most part, you know, pretty stable.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
In terms of unique as a percentage of the overall cumulative membership base, I think in part we're seeing there is pretty rapid growth in international markets, some developing economies where we want to continue to hone in on the right member value propositions, and focus on delivering as much value as we can. And that will come with time. I think China is an excellent example of that. Earlier, I mentioned we'd like to take a similar approach in India.
In terms of the year-over-year growth rate, last year, especially in Q4, there was a fair degree of transactional engagement, people responding to certain optimization efforts that we had made at the time.
And going forward, we've already kind of been introducing this; we reduced the number of emails we sent by 40% on a per member basis. And that was certainly very well-received, in terms of creating a better experience. We had been hearing from our members for some time that they wanted less email; they wanted higher-quality engagement in terms of our reaching out to them. We're going to continue to focus on that.
And going forward, we're going to continue to take an approach where we're putting member value first. And it's not about any specific metric, so much as it's about ensuring that we understand who we're trying to reach, that target audience, with what specific value propositions, and then building the best possible product that we can. Uniques, page views, sessions, these are all going to continue to be some proxy of value, but we're not going to get too focused on any one of those.
Jeffrey Weiner - Chief Executive Officer & Director
