Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations
Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.
Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.
Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance. Jim will provide additional detail on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the rest of the year.
Before I discuss this quarter's performance, I'd like to remind you that Q3 last year was a terrific quarter. Sales were up 10% which includes strong growth in several product lines, including wood, packaging, paints, and china which had a 30% volume growth quarter, and the highly promoted launch of Valspar's Reserve paint at Lowe's.
In this year's third quarter, in addition to being up against last year's strong performance, we've been impacted by FX and the change in product lineup at Lowe's. Despite these challenges, we delivered solid performance in the quarter with sequential volume improvement, a 6% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBIT, and a 10% increase in EPS. These results were driven by strong commercial execution and significant productivity initiatives.
I'll move on now to discuss some segment-specific highlights from the quarter. In Q3, our Coatings segment grew volume 1%, and sales in local currency were flat. We were up against a tough comparison from Q3 last year, as I just discussed. We also saw some uneven market conditions across geographies, including the negative impact of weather in parts of the U.S. Despite these headwinds, we grew our adjusted EBIT by 5% in local currency.
Looking at the Coatings product lines individually, Packaging volume was flat for the quarter, which was an improvement from the modest Q2 decline. Highlighting the quarter was continued very strong growth in Asia and Latin America and further growth in non-BPA coatings in both North America and Europe. Volume growth in General Industrial was up high-single digits, driven by new business wins in Asia and modest volume improvement in North America and Europe. Our Coil product line is having an excellent year. However, we experienced a lower growth rate in Q3 than we had in the past several quarters, largely as a result of weather that adversely affected construction projects in parts of the U.S. So, on balance, while growth in our Coatings segment was not as strong as in previous quarters, I think performance was good in the context of the tough comparisons to 2014 and some unevenness in our end markets. We are well-positioned for the future as we benefit from our technology leadership, diversified portfolio, strong market positions, and significant share opportunities.
I'll now turn to our Paints segment. In Q3, as expected, volumes were down. Volume was negative 4% and sales in local currency were negative 3%. Paints segment adjusted EBIT was up 18% in the quarter. As a reminder, our Paints segment includes our Auto Refinish product line. Auto Refinish, excluding the impact of the Quest acquisition, had a good quarter, with volume up mid-single digits. The Quest acquisition almost doubled the size of our Auto Refinish product line. We've closed the acquisition in June and are on track with the integration. Quest sales in the quarter were on plan, and we've received very positive feedback from our customers on the combined offering of brands and products.
Now, I'll discuss our global consumer paints product line, which is our Paints segment excluding Auto Refinish. Volume and sales in local currency were down high-single digits. We again enjoyed positive volume growth in our international consumer paints businesses, but this was offset by the expected volume decline in North America. So looking specifically at North America consumer paints, as expected, total volumes declined double digits. Strong growth in the hardware channel was offset by the impact of the discontinued price point at Lowe's. Excluding the impact of this price point, the volume and sales in North America were up high-single digits.
We normally don't discuss detail about specific customers, but I know that our investors desire more information on our performance in the North America home improvement channel. Our performance in the third quarter was modestly above our plan. Excluding the discontinued price point at Lowe's, our sell-through of Valspar products was up mid-single digits in Q3. This was excellent performance, considering we were up against the strong comps of the heavily promoted Valspar Reserve paint from last year. And since we are now through the main part of the painting season, I can say, we expect the revenue impact of the discontinued price point at Lowe's to be at the low-end of our original guidance of $150 million to $180 million for fiscal 2015. I'm proud of our team's performance and laser focus on helping Lowe's grow their paint business. This performance is a strong proof point to the value of our world-class retail execution, great brand, and top-ranked consumer paints.
Moving on to international sales in the Paint segment, China volume was up, but sales were down driven by a higher mix of value products and a headwind of the 30% volume comparison to last year. In Australia, volumes were flat. In the UK, our volume growth at B&Q continued to be very strong.
Wrapping it all up, I'm pleased with our performance and our execution especially in light of the challenges we face this year. Based on these solid results, we are updating our EPS guidance to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 for fiscal 2015. Looking forward, I continue to be extremely optimistic about our long-term growth plans. As you know, we have a number of growth initiatives in both Coatings and Paints, and we are very well-positioned to continue to grow our business consistent with the company's long-term trend.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I will cover our third quarter performance highlights and discuss expectations for the rest of fiscal 2015.
Starting first with Q3 performance, reported sales decreased 7% and volume was flat. While sales declined, we increased adjusted EBIT 6% and EPS was up 10%. The impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced sales in Q3 by 5% and the Quest acquisition increased sales by 2%. Excluding FX, Q3 sales decreased 1% and EPS improved 15%.
Gary has already covered many of the key highlights from our sales performance in the quarter. I would like to add a couple of data points and provide you with some additional color. First, looking at sales in the Coatings segment, volumes increased 1% and sales were flat in local currency. To help put this performance in context, these results were up against strong comparison to last year when volumes in most of the Coatings product lines were up mid-single digits. As you recall, volume growth in Coatings accelerated in the second half of last year, driven by new business wins in Packaging, General Industrial, and strong performance in Coil.
In the Paints segment, Q3 sales in local currency decreased 3% and volumes declined 4%. Volume growth at international regions was more than offset by the expected decline in North America. The acquisition of Quest added 3% to Paints segment volume and 6% to segment sales in Q3. As Gary mentioned earlier, excluding the product line adjustment in North America, all regions increased volumes in the quarter.
Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 36.2%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by many of the same factors we discussed last quarter. We saw continued benefit from productivity initiatives in our supply chain and manufacturing activities. In addition, we saw select benefits from cost price where the Asia region continues to see the biggest improvement.
Looking at expenses in Q3, adjusted OpEx of 21% of sales increased 40 basis points. Operating expense dollars declined 5% driven by the impact of FX and benefits from cost reduction programs. We also have lower spending in the Paints segment, given the investments made to support the significant product launches in the prior year. Bringing it all together, consolidated EBIT increased 6% and EBIT margins increased 180 basis points to finish at 15.2%.
In the Coatings segment, adjusted third quarter EBIT of $120 million decreased 2% while EBIT rate was up 90 basis points. The decrease in EBIT dollars was driven by the impact of FX and the decline in sales, partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives and improved cost price. Excluding the impact of FX, we grew Coatings EBIT by $6 million or up 5% in the quarter.
In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $51.7 million was up 18% from the prior year. This increase was driven by benefits from productivity initiatives, lower OpEx spending, improved cost price, and the Quest acquisition which more than offset the decline in volume.
Rounding out our discussion on the segments, the Other and Administrative segment had EBIT of $2 million compared to a loss of $1 million last year. The improvement was driven by increased volumes from our resin and other product lines included in this segment.
Wrapping up the quarter, our Q3 adjusted tax rate finished at 28.2% which was down 200 basis points versus last year. This improvement was driven by increased utilization of foreign tax credits in the quarter (12:08-12:18) resulting from several tax planning initiatives. Given our year-to-date tax rate, we now expect our annual adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be closer to 30% versus our previous range of 31% to 32%.
Let's move on to operating cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations, which excludes restructuring expenses, was approximately $131 million. This amount reflects the decline from the prior year. A majority of this decline is attributed to tiny differences in payments for material purchases versus last year. Excluding the impact of these items which are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, operating cash flow through Q3 would have been approximately 6% below last year. It's worth noting that the fourth quarter is historically our largest operating cash flow quarter. And finally, we pay $24 million of dividends representing a per-share increase of 15% and repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our company stock for a total investment of $75 million during the quarter.
With this as context on Q3, let's discuss the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. Based on our year-to-date results and Q4 outlook, we've updated our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $4.55 to $4.65. This compared to our previous range of $4.45 to $4.65. In addition, we now expect total annual sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared to fiscal 2014. This outlook is modestly lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our actual performance in Q3 and sales outlook for the fourth quarter.
Just a quick reminder that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the quarter we're now in, does not include the 53rd week like it did last year. This impacts our North American business only. For reference, the 53rd week positively impacted the fourth quarter last year by approximately $40 million in sales and $0.04 of EPS.
In closing, our Q3 performance was solid in light of the strong growth last year and uneven demand environment this year. We remain focused on executing our plans to successfully close out the fiscal year. Looking forward, we have a number of exciting growth initiatives in both the Coatings and Paints segments that position us well for improved growth and returns for Valspar shareholders.
With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our first question will come from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I have is that you talked about your Lowe's business being up mid-single digits, which, based on most commentary, it seems like you're outperforming your Paint department. What do you think is driving that, and does this set you up to maybe possibly take some business back as we go into 2016, or is it too early to tell at this point?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Let's not talk about 2016 yet, Ivan. I'll talk though â this is Gary. I'll talk about the quarter and what we've seen, so far this year. So yeah, we're pleased, as I said in my opening remarks, with our performance there. I think there are a number of factors that are supporting it. Number one is that we've got a great brand and great products. And we've got an outstanding retail execution team that supports the Lowe's paint business. We've got almost 400 people in Lowe's stores everyday helping the Lowe's associates grow their Paint department. And you couple that, those three things with the fact that there are literally many tens of millions of people â consumers who had purchased Valspar at Lowe's over the years. And when they go back to buy paint at Lowe's and they're looking for Valspar, they still have options.
We â Lowe's discontinued the price point as you know, but there's an excellent Valspar price point just below that, called Valspar Ultra 2000, and there's an excellent Valspar price point above where that one used to sit, called Valspar Signature. Those are doing extremely well. And in external paints, Valspar Duramax is doing extremely well. So we've got a portfolio of products to serve those consumers. We've got a great team that's helping the Lowe's associates sell those products. And for those factors, brand, product, consumer loyalty and an outstanding team, those are the reasons that we're doing well.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. And then, moving over to the Ace business, has that continued to grow and is that contributing more on a year-over-year basis now that it sounds like your expenses are down?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yes, it has. Yes to both questions, Ivan.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. And then final question, I'll jump back in the queue. In your Coatings business, first quarter, it's been down in terms of EBIT dollars on a year-over-year basis and I guess in a while. How much of FX was the impact there? And when do you â what are you seeing in sort of your international markets in terms of, I guess, the topic of the day is Asia and China, and how that's impacting your business? Do you see any sort of slowdown as we move to the quarter, et cetera?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll answer the last part of your question first and then Jim can answer the question's first part which is on FX. So, nothing has fundamentally changed in our Coatings business side. And we've been on a great run, as you know. And I expect that we'll be on a great run in 2016 as well. This was just an unusual quarter. We had some â as I mentioned in my remarks and I think Jim did, too, we had a little bit of an unevenness in some of our markets. So, for example, our Coil business in the U.S., which has been on a tear, was slowed up by the poor weather that we saw in some parts of the U.S. this year and some construction projects that were delayed. We expect that we'll recover those sales in the next couple of quarters. So, my point is fundamentally nothing's changed.
In Europe, we actually saw some in the General Industrial and Coil product lines, we saw some incremental improvement over Q2 â sequential improvement over Q2. Packaging, as you know, the Packaging business is doing well in Europe, but there was a volume issue that we disclosed I think in Q2 where a high-volume, low-profit product was lost in a competitive bid. But excluding that, the packaging business in Europe is performing well.
And in Asia, in China specifically, our Coatings business in the quarter had a good quarter. Packaging did extremely well. Our General Industrial business which is, as you know, the big parts of that are Container, Pipe, and Off-road did well. We're taking share in Off-road. Despite the challenges in the Off-road market, we're taking share there. The Container business continues to grow.
So, I read the same headlines as you do, and have the same concerns about future growth in those markets that investors do. But we've got big share opportunities. We're taking share. Every one of our Coatings businesses in the quarter grew on a net new business basis, meaning business won minus business lost. So again, it's just â it was just an unusual quarter from the context of seven or eight really good ones in a row.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah, and Ivan, it's Jim. Good morning. You're absolutely right, it's been a while since our EBIT declined in the Coatings segment, which was one of the reasons we called out both in the prepared remarks that if you look at the impact of FX in Coatings, instead of being down too, from a reported standpoint, FX would have been â EBIT would have been up closer to 5% or a $6 million increase year-over-year. So, still saw growth in the Coatings segment based on the productivity initiatives we've driven in the business and the performance we've seen somewhere to previous quarters.
Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yup. Thank you.
Operator
And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. Gary, can you discuss on raw materials, the cadence you expect to realize in terms of benefits going forward and the latest drop in crude? How do you foresee that flowing through your cost of goods over the next six months to nine months here?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, as you know, David, we buy derivatives in crude, some that are way up the value chain and are way down the value chain, I should say. And the correlation for raw material costs in crude is not so high. It's really supply and demand that drives the pricing of our raw materials. I'll say we, again this quarter, saw some modest benefits from raw material costs. Pretty wide disparities across the regions with, as Jim called out in his remarks, Asia seeing a big benefit because of the perceptions of a weak market and some legitimate weak markets in other categories. So we saw a big benefit in our Asia business, less so in Europe and less so regionally in North America. So, in terms of looking forward, we would expect a relatively benign raw material environment. But again, the movements in crude, the almost weekly movements in crude prices don't really factor into our planning.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just on the use of cash going forward, Gary, you've been pretty aggressive buying back stock. Are we going to see a little more debt paydown now post-Quest or how would you think about use of cash going forward?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. David, it's Jim. We really don't think about the use of cash going forward different than we've had historically. We prioritize the utilization of cash to first fund the growth in our organic businesses. Our shareholders enjoy and appreciate the nice dividend the company pays. And then we're certainly always in the marketplace looking for acquisitions that accretively add to our business both strategically and financially. Just similar to history, we just can't time when those acquisitions are going to happen. So in the meantime, we think we've got a great opportunity and have driven shareholder returns by being active in the marketplace over the last several years with share repurchases. So that cash allocation strategy really hasn't changed going forward. It will more depend on the outlook, David, around what do we think the M&A environment looks like over the next several years.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Are there plans to pay down any debt the next 6 months, 12 months or no?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Well, first thing is we paid down a chunk right after quarter-end. So we had a bond of about $150 million that came due at quarter-end. You probably see that in our current liability. So that chunk has been paid. Beyond that, we'll have to see what opportunities present themselves from an M&A standpoint before we make a determination on our debt.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Thanks, David.

And our next question will come from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.
Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. You have a $0.10 range in EPS expectations here for the year which is still kind of wide given just one quarter to go. So just wondering from your point of view what are the biggest swing factors that get us to the high-end or low-end of that range?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah, Kevin, a couple of things. So, as you know, we focus on the annual guidance as a company and not dissimilar to last year as we get three quarters of the way into the business. When we see the results of the performance year-to-date, and we look at the full-year guidance range, obviously there are parts of that guidance range that make less sense in total. So all we're really doing is that we're chopping off the back half â the back end of the guidance range that just mathematically can't make sense anymore. I would look at the guidance range we have out there as just really being a prudent update to our annual outlook overall. We're not trying to signal many things specifically about the low-end of that number or the high-end of that number. That's just the best update we can provide to be prudent in light of the environment we see on the annual guidance.
Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And then we're pretty far along in this paint season, so I think this is really the first true season you've had B&Q â your paint in B&Q. So just wondering if you could update us on your performance so far throughout this paint season.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Kevin. It's been good. I mean, consumer acceptance of our paint is high. We've activated our full team now. B&Q is fully behind the rollout. We've won a couple of new product lines there just as we move into the fall. So I'd say, all systems go at B&Q.
Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. Great. All right, thank you very much.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.

And the next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Bob.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Gary, you had projected a goal in Australia and New Zealand to get up to a 12% margin structure. I'm just curious is â in light of Masters maybe growing a little bit more slowly or the world is growing a little bit more slowly, is there anything that would cause you to be a little concerned about reaching that target?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Absolutely not.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That was an easy one. Let me ask you more broadly. In your GI business, it's full of lots of things where it seems like investors are running heavy machinery, some pipe and valves, some broader-based industrial stuff, but your business seems to be doing exceptionally well. Can you give us a little more granularity on within the GI, the broad umbrella, what's doing really well and maybe what's not doing as well?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. Sure, Bob. I kind of touched on (27:06) I think our container business with Maersk is going well and I expect that particularly with some of the concerns that Chinese regulators and consumers have around environmental issues that further conversions from water-based container coatings to â from solvent-based to water-based container coatings will occur. So that's doing well. Our off-road business in China is doing well despite the fact that that market is soft, as we've talked about in previous calls. We won a lot of market share with the local players there. So that business is holding its own. Our pipe business is having a great year this year. And as I said earlier, and I can't get as granular on the specifics of Europe because there aren't any particularly large segments in Europe GI that we focus on, they're â all tend to be smaller, through the Inver acquisition. But the integration of Inver which is now a couple of years until we made the acquisition has gone really well, and that team is growing their general industrial business there.
So, yeah, I mean it's â again, we all read the same headlines and we listen to our competitors report, and I think that that maybe cast a little bit of doubt on the overall (28:46). We feel like we're really well-positioned and that we're in a place where we can continue to grow.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And then if I might slip the last one in on packaging, if you excluded the lower margin business that you lost or let go, would Europe have been positive or North America positive for the quarter in Packaging?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Europe would have been, yeah, in volumes. Yeah.
Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Thanks, guys. So, I guess, my first question is just in Coatings. I appreciate the tough comp you saw in China, as well as elsewhere. But the comps continue to get tougher, and in the future quarters, I guess, what's your outlook in volume growth for Coatings, and maybe if you can break that down by product line?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. We're not going to go through a forward view of each of the individual businesses, but maybe set a couple of pieces on context, Arun. One is, if you look at the performance of the Coatings segment really, over the last two years, quarter on top of quarter, if I look at the two-year comps, we've been growing the business from a volume perspective in the mid single to high single-digit range on a two-year basis.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
So, we continue to see the success that we had last year especially as we move in to Q4. We're going to have a couple of other, I'd say, unique comparisons as well. I reminded people in my comments about the 53rd week that we'll experience in the North American business, and also we talked pretty extensively last year around the non-BPA conversion in Europe. A lot of those sales started to take place really at the end of Q3 and certainly into Q4. So we had a very strong packaging volume growth (30:39-30:55) last year.
So we have to anniversary those things in the mix, but going forward to the point Gary made, we're still focused on growing our market share in each of our Coatings businesses. We got a long way to go and continuing to grow our Packaging business in Europe which is a bigger market than North America. We're continuing to make great progress in growing Packaging in China, which is a key growth strategy of that business. And our Coil business and Wood business continue to have growth opportunities given their share in the markets to drive growth.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
But just to clarify, if we're all seeing the same headlines and global growth is slowing, is it technology or service or are there specific reasons why you think you can continue to kind of hit that mid single to high single level of volume growth?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. I think there's all of those. So if you look at the technology differences that we've been talking about in our packaging business around non-BPA, that environment is still going to be in place. If you look at the Europe â I'm sorry, if you look at the Asian business from a packaging standpoint, can consumption continues to grow in that marketplace as the economy moves for more utilization of bottles into cans. So yes, there may be differences in demand next year, but that trend of moving the bottles to cans isn't going to change from a structural standpoint. And I would say the story within each of our individual Coatings businesses also has similar elements depending upon the geography that we're in. So we'll have to wait and see, and to see how the year pans out, next year. Currently, there's certainly some volatility in the marketplace. But even despite that volatility issue, we're posting strong growth in some of those end markets that are struggling a little bit.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. And then on the other segment, this is the second quarter in a row that we're seeing some strong growth from your in-house resin production. With the drop in oil, do you expect that to continue? Is there a right level of guidance you can help us with for that segment? I know it's small, but just to put it into context.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. Just a couple of things, our resin business has been performing well. They've been growing volume, right? So they've seen some of the productivity improvements from a supply chain and manufacturing perspective that our other businesses have. But that business has been doing a nice job of growing volumes, which has helped contribute to the performance. From an individual segment standpoint, as you know, we don't provide guidance, individual segments. What I would say is, with the benefits that we've seen there this year are largely driven by the business improvements in resins. And we have a small furniture protection business that's included in that segment as well that has been growing a little bit. So, you're right in the context of our total Paints and total Coatings businesses, they're relatively â that's relatively small, but we've seen nice performance from those businesses.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And just lastly if I may on Paints. There's been some discussion about further market share shifts also in non-paint categories. Are you seeing anything in stains or any other areas that we should be aware of? Do you have still a positive outlook there and maybe if there's any detail on that?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You have to be â tell me specifically what you're talking about, Arun.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Well, I mean, I guess I've heard of some shifting around in stains at various retailers. I don't know if that's impacted you at all, but I guess I was curious if it has.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Only in a positive way.

So, what we've â we've rolled out distribution of Cabot stains through the Ace Hardware organization. I think we're placed in 1,500 stores, roughly 1,500 Ace Stores today. We've got a 500-store test of Cabot running at the Home Depot at the moment and that...
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
...appears to be doing well. So, if there are changes in the stain category, I would say that they'd be positives for Valspar.
Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

And our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Yes. Good morning.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Good morning, P.J.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
So â yeah. Gary, with lower raw material prices, you've seen lower propylene, TiO2, et cetera. Have you seen any pricing pressure or a discounting at the big boxes or hardware stores? And the same question on the Coatings side, are any of your customers asking for givebacks?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, P.J., as I â as we've taken pains to say, although the reductions in some of those raw materials don't necessarily flow right through to the cost of product. There have been some â as I said, there are some modest improvements that we saw on the cost structure, particularly in Asia where we have done some things with our customers that would support their business. And then, there are some isolated instances where there have been raw materials, specific raw material movements that have led us to make some pricing adjustments with other customers. But it certainly hasn't been across the board. It's been targeted. It's been specific to unique situations where we've â where there's been an actual reduction on raw material costs and that's the way we run our business and supply chains.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And just quickly, is that more on the Coatings side or is that isolated incidences on the Paints side?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's been more on the coatings side.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
And then, secondly, you talked about you have at Lowe's, you have paint price points just below the new competitor product and just about the new competitor product. So if you look at where this new product, HGTV paint, taking share, is it taking share from the higher end price point or lower end price point? Thank you.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I tried to explain that both the price point, our high price point paints and our low price points paints, are doing exceptionally well, better â much better than last year at those price points.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. So...
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So you can't â that's not taking share. That's growth. That's the way I was trying to explain it, P.J. If I didn't explain that well, sorry. But no, those price â both those price points above and below the competitive entries are doing extremely well.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. So the only business you lost was that price point and it has an impact than anything else.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Correct.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)

And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thank you and good morning. If I heard your â Gary, your prepared comments correctly, I think you indicated that you'd step back a bit on the media spending after introducing it at a much higher level last year. Is that level that you're at now? Should we think about that as sort of the run rate, or do you think there's more opportunity to be more efficient with it going forward?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think what you're referring to, Vincent, is the â when I mentioned the highly promoted Valspar Reserve last year. Yeah, I mean, I think whenever there's a new product launch, there's more advertising than there would be on a run rate basis. So if you're asking me is the advertising that we're putting behind that particular product lower this year than last year, the answer is yes.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Yeah. And I was just asking whether this was sort of, as you mentioned, when you introduce something, it's high, but now, it's a known product. So is this the correct run rate then?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, yeah, I think about this â I don't know â if you're thinking about it in terms of a quarter, I'm thinking about it...
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I'm thinking about it sort of â as just sort of the go-forward. Should we see it progressively come down sequentially going forward or â and then step back up in the same quarter next year, or what's the...
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We're going to â I think about next year, next paint season, what news we have, what new products we'll be introducing at which retailers, and that will determine the level of advertising spend that we do next year. There's a ROI calculation that we do. We work with our retail partners to determine how much promotional dollars that they're willing to put behind the products. We'll make a commitment of dollars to support product launches and our brand, and that will be a negotiated number.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
But it will always have a positive ROI for us and our retail partner.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Understood. And then just a quick one on the weather impact you mentioned in Coil which you saw, and that you expect to get it back. But the â on the architectural side of things, obviously we've heard from all of your competitors that there was an issue in the calendar second quarter. You obviously have a glimpse into the calendar third quarter, both in the quarter you reported and where you are today. Are you seeing some sort of exterior paint work that was â the days were lost in the North American market, or do you think that's going to catch up a bit over the balance of the year or hard to tell?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. As we look at our DIY paint business and our Pro paint business, we certainly did not see the same trends in our exterior products as we saw in our interior products, speaking to the general softness that people have come under (40:39) from a weather standpoint. So we think we're going to get a portion of that back at the end of the day. But it's really difficult for us to slice specifically how much that impacted us in the quarter, which is why we didn't call that component out specifically.
Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks very much.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Thanks for your questions, Vincent.

And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC
Hi. This is Matt Skowronski filling in for Dmitry. Now that your B&Q business is kind of fully established, can you comment on how things are going and whether or not you think the business is meeting your initial expectation?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I commented on it earlier, Matt. It's Gary. It's going well. And I would say that it's meeting our (41:27), but it was delayed. If you'll recall, the rollout was delayed by six months or eight months due to the complexity of resetting the stores. So if you look at the pure financial model that we had, say, 18 months ago, we're a little bit behind. But in terms of how we performed since we've set the stores, we're right on our plan.
Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. All right. And on the margin side, what would you say is kind of driving margins now in the future? Obviously, your efficiency initiative has been working (41:59) quite well as we saw with margins this time. Would you say that this is going to continue for the rest of the year or well into 2016?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah. Well, what we've called out in previous calls that â and we expect margin improvement to continue in this year. I've commented specifically from a total Valspar perspective that the rate of margin growth was going to be less in Q3 and Q4 than we experienced in the second quarter and that's exactly how things have played out. So we're going to start to anniversary some of the benefits from a productivity standpoint that we started last year, mainly on the manufacturing side of the business with some of the plant closures we did related to Inver and how we also have set the operating environment in support of the Ace business. So we're going to be up a little against a little tougher comparison margin in Q4, if you go back and look at last year's Q4 margin which I believe was up close to 180 basis points. So we're going to see a little step-down. But we're still going to have growth over the previous year in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC
Perfect. Thank you so much.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yes. Thanks, Matt.

And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good, Matt. Thanks.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hey. Good. You touched on this briefly before, but how did Pack â how did the flat Packaging volumes during this third quarter compare to overall market performance? And can you guys provide some additional detail on relative performance and competition both in Europe and the U.S.?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Here's the way I think about it, Matt. We performed at the market in North America. We performed well above the market in Asia, and excluding the one piece of business that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters that we lost low margin, high volume, we would go on at or above the market.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, given some of the more positive trends we've seen in the Marine Coatings business, can you guys talk a little bit more about how Marine Coatings volumes have progressed during 2015 and then what your expectations are moving forward?
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah, Matt. As we look at our business, I would say we really don't have a Marine Coatings business. You may be referring to our Container business that is certainly products that are used and shipped via marine. So, our Container business within General Industrial has been very strong, really given the technology that we put forth in the marketplace in China around water coatings. But I would say comparing our results from a marine standpoint to others is probably a little bit of an apple-and-oranges comparison.
Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. That's helpful as well. That's it for me.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Thank you, Matt. And, operator, I think there's one last question in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. And that will come from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Hi. Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups, I guess, from me. On Quest, if I did my math correctly, it looks as though the contribution from Quest is annualizing quite a bit less than that where the revenue run rate was for 2014. I guess, can you help us understand some of the seasonality in 3Q if there was any or what's maybe some of the puts and takes on the revenues from Quest in the quarter maybe, what we can expect for Q4?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll take the first part now and let Jim answer your specific question, Mike. Quest, as I've said, Quest is performing on our sales plan. So, there is no â there has been no degradation from 2014. I'm not sure where you got that number since it wasn't a public company and part of the company in 2014. But we're right on our plan, both in terms of revenue growth, integration, cost synergies, and getting the management teams aligned on the new program. So, I'm not sure where you got your data point, but I'm going to let Jim explore that a little further with you.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah, and there is some seasonality through it. The way I will just helicopter up and say that it's roughly a $200 million business from an annual standpoint. There is lower seasonality for the business in Q4 than there is in Q3, but to Gary's point, we're not thinking about that business any differently than we have in the past and we're certainly not seeing a decline versus the previous year.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And Mike, something that might be helpful here is remember that when we acquired Quest, it was about $200 million in revenue. $50 million of that went, I guess, reported in â or I guess, sorry...
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
It's all in Paints.
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's all in Paints, but actually, it's â they end up in different places in the company.
Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer
Yeah.
Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. All right that's helpful. And I guess, just one other â some notes that I'm curious about is on your supply chain efficiencies and I guess to the extent that that includes optimizing manufacturing to support the B&Q rollout now that that's established, I guess how much more can be done just sort of optimize the supply into that channel from the total manufacturing or adjacent manufacturing in Europe versus manufacturing in different geographies and should have been there?
Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
There might be some incremental improvements that we could make. Our supply chain, the cost structure of our supply chain to support B&Q is in good shape, Mike.
Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
All right. Fair enough. Thanks very much.
Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations
