James E. Craddock
Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone, we appreciate you joining us this morning. As we bring the first half of 2013 to a close, we can proudly reflect on all we've accomplished during that period. Our focus continues to be on successful execution of our development plans, during the remainder of the year and delivering on the targets we've set.
We've got a great second quarter led by 2 key asset acquisitions that has significantly added to our inventory of repeatable projects. Let's review our list of key accomplishments for the second quarter. We closed on our Permian acquisition, establishing entry into the basin and a new core operating area.
We acquired an additional 10% working interest covering approximately 1/2 of Gates Ranch, increasing our ownership to 100% throughout the position. We completed successful Eagle Ford discovery wells delineating 2 new additional leases. We set an all-time record for daily total equivalent production and we recorded sequential Eagle Ford daily equivalent production growth for the 14th consecutive quarter. Let's talk through the accomplishments in a bit more detail. A key second quarter achievement was the completion of our Permian acquisition, which marked our entry into the basin and established a new core operating area for our company. The acquisition closed on May 14, and has 53,000 net acres and over 1,500 net vertical drilling locations, assuming 20 acre spacing.
On July 31, we assumed full operation of the Permian assets at the termination of the transition services agreement with the seller. The Permian acquisition is part of our ongoing strategic focus to pursue new growth opportunities and expand our inventory of repeatable liquids-rich projects. We continue to seek out and evaluate asset acquisitions in and around our 2 core areas. During the quarter, in our Eagle Ford area and Gates Ranch, we acquired an additional 10% working interest in 46 gross-producing wells and the leasehold associated with 170 future growth drilling locations for a total of $126 million. Net production associated with the acquisition was approximately 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day as of the June 5, 2013 close date. We now own 100% working interest in the entire Gates Ranch asset.
We were active across most of our Eagle Ford assets during the second quarter. We entered the quarter with 45 drill wells awaiting completion, 18 of which were located on Gates Ranch. Briscoe Ranch now has 19 drill wells awaiting completion, up from 7 at the end of the first quarter. John Clayton will provide more detail on our Briscoe Ranch plans, but we are looking at a significant increase in activity here as we move from the drilling phase to the completion phase on this lease. We will be active in Briscoe through 2016.
In the Karnes Trough area, located in the oil window, 6 of the drilled wells awaiting completion are on the Dubose lease. Two of the Dubose wells were completed late in the second quarter and the remaining 6 wells are now completed and online. We also completed 2 Eagle Ford discovery wells, successfully delineating our Tom Hanks lease in LaSalle County and our Lopez Farm-in in Live Oak County. The Tom Hanks well tested at 660 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the Lopez well tested at 1,970 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In total, the success of these 2 areas provide additional delineation to approximately 50 net Eagle Ford drilling locations in our capital inventory.
Approximately 83% of our current Eagle Ford inventory locations remain to be completed. Total daily equivalent production was a record for the quarter, up 46% from the same period a year ago and up 34% from the first quarter -- I'm sorry, up 4% from the first quarter. We recorded 46% year-over-year and less than 1% sequential growth in our Eagle Ford volumes. As we have discussed on past calls, our quarterly production can and will vary based on operational decisions that may include proactively shutting in and producing wells when warranted. During the second quarter, we did experience some operational interruptions that impacted our Eagle Ford production. Likewise, we made the decision to delay completions at our Briscoe Ranch property in order to implement an improvement in the configuration of our pad locations that should reduce the impact of offset fracturing on producing wells. This change in plans impacted the percentage of oil production we experienced in the quarter slightly. John Clayton will provide more detail on this later in the call.
Our production through the first half of 2013 is up 42% versus the same period a year ago. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our annual guidance targets for year. As you read in our earnings release, we did reaffirm the 2013 annual guidance ranges provided in mid-April for capital production expenses, pro forma for our acquisitions. Including -- I'm sorry, excluding acquisition capital, we expect to spend $840 million to $900 million of capital to run a 5 to 6 rig program in Eagle Ford and a Delaware Basin program with initially 3 rigs increasing to 6 rigs during the year. We are also estimating our full year average daily production guidance to range from 51,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. To put this number in to perspective, our full year average last year was 37,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We will discuss our 2013 annual guidance more -- later in more detail.
Overall, our second quarter performance keeps us on the path to deliver on our full year percent growth and cost targets. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, our top priority will be the successful execution of our Eagle Ford and Permian development plans and the continued pursuit of unconditional resource growth opportunities in and around our core operating areas.
Now let me turn the call over to John Hagale, who will provide an update or summary of our financial results.
John E. Hagale
Thank you, Jim, and welcome, everyone. As a reminder to all, all of the information we're reviewing today is contained in our 10-Q, as well as our press release, both of which were filed with the SEC yesterday and are available on our website. Net income for the second quarter was $75.4 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, versus net income of $77 million or $1.46 per diluted share a year ago.
Adjusted net income, net non-GAAP net income, increased for the quarter to $52.3 million or $0.88 per diluted share. That's when you exclude unrealized gains on derivative and also exclude financing and transaction fees associated with our Permian acquisition. That compares to $0.58 per diluted share a year ago on a non-GAAP basis. For the second quarter, revenues were $237 million compared to $198 million for the same period a year ago. Second quarter revenues, including realized derivatives, were $194 million in 2013 compared to $126 million a year ago. Year-over-year growth in revenue was due to increased production and higher average realized oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by lower NGL prices.
For the quarter, when you include realized derivatives, 53% of our revenue was generated from oil compared to 52% a year ago, and 27% of our revenues from NGL sales compared to 31% a year ago. Second quarter revenue from oil sales, including realized derivatives, increased 57% from $65 million a year ago to $102 million today.
Oil revenue was also favorably impacted by a pricing increase of $2.67 from a year ago. Our second quarter average realized oil price, excluding derivatives, was $92.82 a barrel, down $5.63 from the first quarter of this year at $98.45. The sequential decrease reflects lower LLS prices for the quarter. As I mentioned during the first quarter call, these numbers to fluctuate. Since our realized oil price is more impacted by changes in LLS than WTI, I would expect to see an average realized price for the rest of this year of LLS minus $11 or $12 for the total company.
Moving to the cost side of things. We experienced a 17% increase in train and transportation cost on a per unit basis versus the first quarter of 2013, and about a 1% increase when you compare it to a year ago on a unit basis.
The higher unit transportation costs were due to realizing a full quarter of stabilization fees on our oil, as well as the fees related to a full quarter of the previously announced new gas transportation and processing capacity that came online during the first quarter. Net G&A expense, when you exclude stock-based compensation, increased by 20% versus the first quarter of 2013 and was essentially flat for the prior year when you look at this on a unit basis. I should note that the quarter net G&A expense includes $1.2 million of transaction costs associated with the Permian acquisition. Interest expense for the quarter on a unit basis was up 37% compared to the prior year. Sequentially, interest expense on a unit basis more than doubled.
I should note again that second quarter interest expense included $5.6 million in fees for our bridge credit facility that provided backup financing for the Permian acquisition. Our expense guidance for 2013 was included in the earnings press release and it is outlined again on Slide 5. The estimates were unchanged from the annual guidance we released in mid-April. I do want to point out 1 area of expense. Current quarter DD&A expense is trending below the low end of the DD&A range we have given you for guidance of $11.95 to $13.15 per BOE. We expect to see a meaningful increase in our DD&A expense in the second half of the year due to our Permian asset being included in our full cost pool.
On the hedging front, we maintained an active hedging program and add derivative positions to our production as a part of our effort to manage exposure to commodity prices. During the quarter, we executed additional derivative transactions for natural gas swaps and collars, for 2013, '14 and '15 and for oil swaps for 2015. A detailed summary of our derivative position as of July 31, is attached to the press release. I'll end with a quick note on liquidity. As of June 30, we had outstanding borrowings of $190 million under our senior revolving credit facility. On July 31, we had drawn $220 million with $580 million available for borrowing under the facility.
That's all I have for now. Let me turn the call over to John Clayton.
John D. Clayton
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will update you on operational performance and activities for the company, then our activities and highlights for the Eagle Ford, followed by our activities and highlights for the Permian, and finally, reaffirmation of our 2013 capital production and expense guidance.
Now let's start with our second quarter operational performance. As we have mentioned in the past, these resource plays offer tremendous long-term growth. However, their nature is that, that growth comes in lumps as new wells come on in batches while other wells might be shut in for offsetting completions to take place or facilities to be upgraded. This lumpiness was definitely the case during the second quarter and I will go over some of the ups and downs a little later. With that said, we experienced another record quarter for our company as we achieved an all-time high in production.
Excluding acquisitions, capital spending for the quarter was $188 million and we drilled 30 gross wells and completed 22. Our average daily production for the quarter was 48,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 46% from the prior year. Total Eagle Ford production was 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also up 46% from the prior year, and up slightly from last quarter.
The second quarter total company production rate includes 12,200 barrels of oil per day and a record 18,200 barrels of NGLs per day. Oil production increased by 52% versus the second quarter of 2012 and decreased by 2% when compared to the first quarter oil production numbers, mostly a result of downtime in the Karnes Trough, which I will talk about shortly. Overall liquids production for the quarter represented about 62% of total production. Oil production was 25% of total production, up from 24% a year ago, and down from 26% in the first quarter.
Second quarter production was curtailed at both Gates Ranch and our Karnes Trough area. At Gates Ranch, we experienced roughly 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of net curtailment for the quarter. This curtailment was associated with mechanical downtime at our largest central delivery point, a 22-well facility, the largest in the field, as well as curtailment associated with the line looping project within Gates Ranch, designed to lower fuel gathering pressures. This facility is now back online and the line loop is complete.
In addition to the Gates Ranch curtailment, we also experienced curtailment at our Karnes Trough asset, mostly on the Klotzman lease. The largest impact was a 2-week shut-in of our wells as a result of an offset operator completing 12 of their own wells, which directly offset our lease. The other impact was a result of facilities maintenance activities. Although all wells have been returned to production, the net daily curtailment impact for the quarter associated with Karnes Trough was also roughly 1,000 BOEs per day, resulting in a combined curtailment for the quarter of about 2,000 net BOEs per day in the Eagle Ford. Overall, though, including setbacks like these from time to time, we've had tremendous run times in our Eagle Ford production over the past few years and we're extremely proud of our track record.
If you turn to Slide 7 in the presentation, you can see our results over the past 3 years. This chart also highlights this quarter, our annual guidance estimates and our exit rate expectations. Our annual and exit rate guidance remain unchanged. As our volumes grow, operating cost increased due to additional facilities that are required to handle the high production. In the second quarter 2013, direct LOE totaled $11.1 million, a 46% increase over last year on an absolute basis, approximately $2.5 million of the incremental cost is a result of Permian acquisition, which I will talk about it. And the remainder is primarily due to increased Eagle Ford operations. On a unit basis, second quarter direct LOE was flat at $2.49 per BOE when compared to the same period last year. Sequentially, second quarter direct LOE was 26% higher versus the first quarter results of $1.97 per BOE. Again, reflecting the addition of the Permian properties.
Now let's review some of the operational highlights of the quarter. In our Eagle Ford core area, we operated 5 drilling rigs, mostly at Gates Ranch, Briscoe Ranch, Central Dimmit and the Karnes Trough area. We completed 18 wells and at the end of the quarter, we had 45 wells that had been drilled that are awaiting completion. This number is higher than past quarters, so let me discuss this briefly.
Please turn to Slide 8, which is a map of our Briscoe Ranch lease. In the past, when we go into full development mode on a lease, we drill wells parallel to each other on a single row. Typically, this was done with 3 well pad development design. Once we get our drilling rig out a certain distance from the first well that we will be completing, say a distance of 3 multi-well pads or basically 9 well bores away, we would then begin our completion operations on the first well. This would give us enough separation between completion operations and our drilling operations. We've been doing this for a while now.
Let's fast-forward to today and where we are now. As our operating teams continue to find more efficient ways to develop these assets, they come up with creative ideas and make adjustments on the fly. Briscoe Ranch and what we now call Column Development is a great example of just this. At Briscoe Ranch, we are now drilling 8 wells from a pad, however, these 8 wells are not all in a single row of 8 well bores like our 3 wells from the single pad were. Instead, there are 4 wells in 1 row and 4 wells in the adjacent row. In other words, the area drilled is a rectangular box that is 4 wells wide by 2 wells long. We call this our Column Development Program. By using this technique, which our technical teams have developed, we are able to minimize the amount of production that would be interrupted later if we had to drill the second row at a later date after the first row had already been producing.
However, there's a trade-off to doing this, which is that we need to drill nearly twice as many wells ahead of the completion operations prior to starting the completion phase of the well. And this has resulted in the number of wells drilled but not yet completed to be increased from past levels.
Looking back as we planned out our development at Briscoe for the year, we had originally planned to go with a single row development plan. If we would've stuck to that plan, we would've already completed and had producing more wells at Briscoe by now and a fairly modest number of wells drilled but not yet completed ahead of the frac spread. However, once our teams found out that they had a more efficient way to do things, that being Column Development, we made a change. This meant we defer our Briscoe completions from the first half of this year to the latter part, and instead, spend the time focusing on getting the number of drilled well inventory right for column development and completions, not row development. In doing so, today, we stand at roughly 19 wells at Briscoe Ranch that have been drilled, but not yet completed, a much higher than originally planned number but very practical for a much more efficient completion practice. Since we have inventory in other areas outside of Briscoe, they are fairly quick to move on and complete, primarily Gates Ranch and Central Dimmitt, we simply substituted those completions in for the Briscoe completions that we deferred. It's not rocket science, but having a well, delineated inventory allows us to do this efficiently.
Look for us to complete a fairly large amount of Briscoe wells in the second half of this year once our Column Development completion practice begins. That's a lot about Briscoe and our Column Development approach. So let's move on to Central Dimmit County where we drilled 2 7,000-foot laterals and tested 2 different completion designs on each of these wells, one of which was a high-density frac with 26 stages per well. The lease geometry will allow us to drill additional 7,000-foot lateral on the lease, which are planned for the third quarter, so we want to understand the proper density of stages and their impacts.
Let's move on to Gates Ranch. On the first quarter call, I discussed the work we were doing to optimize condensate stabilizers installed at our central battery locations. The condensate stabilization process reduces the volatility of the condensate in the field in order to meet pipeline specs, prior to us sending our oil and condensate to a third-party pipeline. We're still working on optimization but later last month, in many areas, we were already seeing an increase in the condensate yield as we expected. Additionally, most of our oil and condensate is now meeting pipeline specs and are no longer subject to any additional shrink from the gather[ph] .
It's very early, but our results are improving when compared to what we were seeing earlier this year. During our efforts to stabilize the condensate, to meet proper specs without over stabilizing the product and essentially turning condensate into NGLs, something that was definitely occurring. While we feel the condensate stabilization process has been successfully implemented, it's an ongoing part of our field operations and we monitor and adjust as needed, but we are very pleased with where we are today. We continue to develop Gates Ranch on 55-acre spacing or 475 feet between laterals, with no indications of interference. During the second quarter, we completed our first 4 well pad and are now drilling 6 well pads which will improve efficiencies even further. Before we leave Gates Ranch, we are pleased to announce that in the second quarter, we acquired the only remaining working interest underlying the asset. This acquisition totaling $126 million includes 10% working interest and 46 producing wells -- 46 gross producing wells, and a 10% working interest in some of the leases underlying Gates Ranch. There are 170 future gross drilling locations associated with the undeveloped leasehold portion of this transaction. The net production associated with the acquisition was approximately 1,800 BOEs per day at closing, which occurred on June 5. Rosetta now owns 100% working interest in the entire Gates Ranch asset. Needless to say, we are pleased with the performance of the property and owning more of it fits with our efforts to pursue bolt-on opportunities on our existing assets.
Now let's leave Gates Ranch. I'm happy to report that we have tested 2 new Eagle Ford areas on our previously undelineated positions and both have been successful.
Please turn to Slide 9. Our Lopez lease in Live Oak County totals 505 net acres in the oil window of the play. The discovery play, the Lopez Unit 1, had a 7-day stabilized test of 901 barrels of oil per day; 473 barrels of NGLs per day; and 3.55 million cubic feet of natural gas, for a total 7-day average rate of 1,966 BOEs per day. We operate this position with a 100% working interest before payout and a 65% working interest after payout. There is an additional 7 wells to drill on this property.
Please turn to Slide 10. The Tom Hanks lease in northern LaSalle County, is 3,500 net acre position located in the oil window of the play. Our discovery well, the Tom Hanks Eagle Ford Number 1, was completed with a 6,200 and 64-foot lateral and 19 frac stages. The well had a 7-day stabilized test.
[Audio Gap]
For the approximately 600 barrels of oil per day, 26 barrels of NGLs per day, and 192 Mcf of residue gas for a 7-day average rate of 657 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 91% is crude oil.
The second Tom Hanks Eagle Ford well has been drilled and is awaiting completion. During the third quarter, we plan to drill the first pad on the lease, and they are up to 50 well locations remaining to be developed here. We're very pleased with these latest Eagle Ford successes, which further delineate our acreage and adds to the future growth of our company. And as we get more data in these areas, we will update you with our estimated type curves.
Finally, let's cover a quick update of our activities in the Karnes Trough area. In the Karnes Trough oil area, the second quarter was highlighted by the finishing up of the drilling of all the remaining Adele Dubose wells, which totaled 8 wells. We are now finished with the completions of these 8 wells and all are now online. I believe only 2 of these wells were completed and fully drilled out at the end of last quarter. As you know, these wells are oilier than most and we have a net revenue interest of roughly 80%. They should all be on production this month.
Before we move to the Permian, I would like to give a quick update on our exploratory Pearsall well on our Tom Hanks lease. This is the same lease that I mentioned earlier that we drilled the Discovery Eagle Ford well on. During the second quarter, Rosetta tested the Tom Hanks Number 1 well, and exploratory Pearsall well, with a 5,000-foot lateral and 16 frac stages. The well tested at the gross unstabilized rate of 5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day with 1% H2S, and a flowing pressure of 5,400 PSI up casing. Preliminary indications are that the well does not have a significant condensate yield, but when the well stabilizes more, we will make that determination.
Let's move to the Permian. Our Permian team is fully running, and as of taking over operations on July 31, we're well on our way to optimizing operations in this new core area. For the quarter, we operated 3 to 4 rigs in Reeves County. The fourth rig was added in early June, the fifth will be showing up in September and the sixth rig before year end. In the quarter, we drilled 10 vertical wells and completed 9 vertical wells with 2 wells awaiting completion.
As we are ramping up, we now expect to drill roughly 15 operated wells and complete roughly 12 operated wells in the third quarter. Additionally, we just completed the Balmorhea 3215 A Number 1H, an operated horizontal well in the upper Wolfcamp bench. The Balmorhea well has a lateral length of roughly 7,000 feet and was successfully completed
with 16 stages. We have just drilled out all the plugs and the well is now hooked up and flowing back as we speak. This well is situated in the center of our acreage position and I look forward to reporting the results to you next quarter.
On the non-operated side of the Permian, we have also been participating in both vertical and horizontal wells. In the second quarter, we participated in the completion of the Titan [ph] 1804H, a horizontal well in the Northeast portion of our lease position. This well has been on production since May. Currently, we are also participating in 2 horizontal wells on our lease that are also being drilled. Although the vertical program is our primary focus during the initial 6 months of operatorship, as you can see, we continue to monitor, participate and obtain data on the horizontal well activity in and around our Reeves county position. With that said, our current 2013 Permian development plan may now include the spudding of an operated horizontal well by year end.
Let's take a look at inventory. I would now like to turn your attention to Slide 11, which shows our updated Eagle Ford Permian inventory table. With the completion of our Permian acquisition, we have added over 1,500 net locations to our capital project inventory. The Permian inventory is based on 20-acre vertical development in the central and east areas of our Reeves County acreage, and excludes any horizontal inventory at this time, although it is definitely something we are encouraged -- that we're encouraged about, that we will approach diligently. When added to the roughly 850 net locations in South Texas, we have accumulated more than 2,400 net locations company wide, most of which have been successfully delineated.
Finally, let's end with a few comments on our annual guidance for this year. As reported on our earnings press release, we did reaffirm the 2013 annual guidance ranges for capital, production and expenses. Excluding acquisition capital, our 2013 capital guidance is expected to range from $840 million to $900 million. This capital program is based on operating 5 to 6 rigs in the Eagle Ford, and initially operating 3 rigs increasing to 6 by year end in the Permian. We did add the fourth Permian rig in June and are currently expecting to add the fifth rig in September and the sixth by the end of the year.
70% of the capital will be spent for development activities in the Eagle Ford, including facilities projects. Approximately 20% will be allocated to operated and non-operated development activity in the Permian. The remainder of the capital is for new ventures and corporate other.
We are reaffirming our full year daily production guidance of 51,000 to 55,000 BOEs per day. Based on the midpoint of the full year guidance range, we are on track to generate approximately 40% production growth versus last year. We have also reiterated our expense guidance. As I mentioned, on the first quarter call, the most notable expense change is the impact on the acquisition of our increasing direct LOE primarily due to higher operating costs related to the Permian basin assets. Direct LOE is expected to average $2.55 to $2.80 per BOE for the full year. As always, I appreciate your interest in our operations. And with that, I will turn the call back to Jim.
James E. Craddock
Thanks, John. I hope our remarks this morning have provided some clarity on our second quarter results and given additional color on what you can expect from Rosetta for the second half of 2013. We're proud of our progress through the first 6 months and have demonstrated our ability to successfully execute our Eagle Ford development plan. We're on track to expand the operational business success into our new Permian core area, and deliver on our annual guidance targets.
Before we open for Q&A, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Rosetta's technical and business teams and thank them for all their hard work over the first 6 months of 2013. It's been an exciting ride through the first half of the year, and I expect the pace to continue throughout the second half. Let's now turn the call back to the moderator so that we can take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Corales of Howard Weil.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
Can you comment on what current production is?
James E. Craddock
Brian, we didn't put that into the release. We actually are just wrapping up the accounting around July, but so I'd just refer everyone back to the guidance range as we provided you guys. You can do the math on what the first half is and obviously, we're expecting a pretty big second half of the year.
Brian M. Corales - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division
And maybe just to switch to, in the Permian what did you all see I guess, was it the well that you recently just completed, the non-operated horizontal wells, but to want to spud a horizontal well before year end, what was in that kind of changed your opinion?
John D. Clayton
This is John. I think at last count, it's been a few weeks since I looked at it, I believe there was 16 rigs running in the Reeves County alone drilling horizontal wells. So the amount of data that's coming in is pretty fruitful going forward on our planning activities. That, coupled with the 1804 well, although our working interest in this is fairly low, we do have access to reports on it and so forth, and that well looks very good. We're now, I think, coming up on month 4 of the Gaucho well that was drilled the Comstock and we're watching the performance of that well. We're encouraged by that well as well. So it's just now, we're starting to get enough data to where it appears like the risk-reward is good enough for us to go out and do an operated well. We also weren't afforded the opportunity to do it when we only had 3 rigs running. So I mean part of our goal is to get up to a 6 rig count and that gives us some discretion in where we allocate our rigs to where we just don't have unallocated across the entire gross 70,000 acres saving leases, which was really what was occurring when the prior owner had 2 to 3 rigs running. So it's just a lot more data and then 6 rigs gives us a lot more flexibility. But we like what we're seeing in it. But I'll say what we said all along, I mean, we love the vertical part of this program. Our neighbor and operator to the south that bought the J Cleo property is fully developing that right now, drilling just vertical wells, and I think that speaks for the economics of the vertical program. But the horizontal opportunities are looking pretty intriguing based on some of the well results we're seeing.
Operator
Our next question is from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors.
Michael Hall
I guess 1 thing I'm trying to understand is a little bit more around the pace of completion in the second half. I know you've got the big backlog of wells awaiting completion that you outlined in Briscoe, as well as Gates. Is it really the Briscoe backlogs that will be pulled down in the second half, and kind of [ph] start building it back up in Gates as you move to the 6 well pads? How should we think about that? And then does that have any sort of impact on your mix as we head through the rest of the year? Your production mix as we head to the rest of the year and into 2014?
John D. Clayton
Michael, this is John. I'll start with the end of it, the production mix question. We just finished up, I think the first impact of that would be, we just finished up the completion of all of our Adele Dubose wells, which is 1/2 of our acreage position in the Karnes Trough area. Those properties there average about 75%, 76% oil as a component. Not liquids but oil. So in those wells, they're flowing back now, but when those wells start showing up in the production mix when we report quarterly production, they will have an impact on that. And I think you're dead on with 19 wells right now that are awaiting completion that have been drilled. And the drillings rigs still running at Briscoe Ranch. The next larger tranche of oilier weighted properties is going to be Briscoe. And I think our Briscoe Ranch, if my memory serves me correct, is about 28% oil. So compared to Gates Ranch, which is in the high-teens in 20%, we have about 30% more oil that comes out of Briscoe wells. So yes, when those start coming along here in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we'll see that as an impact. But I think you've got it. Briscoe Ranch is going to be a tremendous driver and then the Adele Dubose well that we just recently brought online in the last week or so, will impact going forward.
Michael Hall
And then I guess kind of furthering on that, but in the Permian. The well turn to completion in the third quarter, I think you outlined -- if we just kind of ratchet that up on a pro rata basis for the additional rigs coming on, is that a fair way to think about the pace in the fourth quarter, and then as we make our towards '14?
John D. Clayton
I do. I think you if you look at the scripts and look at our press release when we talked about 2Q activity in the Permian, we talked about a well count from when just Rosetta operated it. When I communicated in my portion of the call script was the whole activity in the quarter, but it just shows that we can go from 10 wells by 3 rigs to 15 wells by running 4 rigs. And our goal to get to 6 by the end of the year, that's going to happen and then you can just pro rate that up. But we're just now starting to enter a completion schedule that's continuous. Before it was complete a well, wait a couple of weeks, go out and complete another well. But now, we can be a lot more efficient with it. And now that's what it takes to get to 6 rigs to start giving us some of those efficiencies in the operations.

Our next question is from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
I wanted to focus on the flexibility of the discussion that you're going over in the Permian as you add rigs out there. You mentioned having the flexibility to drill the horizontal in the back half of the year when you're -- if you get to the 6 rigs by the end of the year, what sort of flexibility does that give you for '14? How much -- how many of those rigs do you need to drill the verticals to keep things as they should be? And how much I guess, leeway do you have, John, to kind of do what you see is best for any given quarter next year?
John D. Clayton
It's a good question, Brian. We're going over the '14 activity levels and scenarios as we speak and we'll be doing that for the next couple of months. But to kind of answer your question, it takes us about 6 rigs to start getting to where we want to kind of fully test a lot of the ideas on the vertical program. I mean, I think, I can see us running at least 6 rigs in the vertical program, testing down spacing like our teams are planning on, trying to get a couple of down spaced areas drilled this year. So I think when we start into a development horizontal program, which I'm not signaling is the case by what's going on in drilling our first operated horizontal well, but I think that would probably and most likely be incremental of the 6. Six is a pretty good well count that gives us about 96 wells a year vertically. And some of those will be used to hold the lease together and then others will be able to test pad applications and down spacing. And so I would look at the 6 well count as what we're kind of targeting for a vertical program. And then if we can make the horizontal program work, I would look for us to bring in some different type of rigs. Although 2 of the ones we have now can -- they have heavy enough iron to drill a horizontal well. But when you go into a development program on horizontal drilling and go to pad drilling, I think we would probably bring in a different type of rig to do that. The other thing I would say that gives us the flexibility, which was I think what you're asking about is a large portion of our lease is 100% working interest out here. And that makes the approval process and some of the regulatory process a lot more efficient when you start permitting horizontal wells that have about 5,000- or 6,000-foot lateral. And so we have a couple of things going for us there. One is a 100% working interest and then the other is, we've got leases that have that interest that are large enough for us to put a horizontal well in and not have to go through the partner approval process to get it drilled.
James E. Craddock
And Brian I would just add that in our thinking, it takes about 2 to 3 rigs just to maintain the lease holding aspects of the leases that we have out there. So really what John is describing is from that base layer of wells that you've got to drill to hold the leases, getting the 6 or so, gives us the ability to really start doing some discretionary things, which is kind of how we move the ball down the field on things well spacing, completion design, things like that.
Brian D. Gamble - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. And then just as a follow-up, I kind of wanted to circle back to the first question on production. And I don't pretend -- expect that you're going to talk about your end of July production rate. But let me just walk through the math and make sure that this is correct, just from a third quarter standpoint. The 2 million barrels a day that was impacted, it seemed like that was all back online as of now. But it might not have been back as of the beginning of the quarter. And then you've got to layer on the incremental full quarter impact of your Permian acreage. It gets you to a reasonable rate for the Q4, the Q3 and Q4 number, maybe a consistent growth rather than a huge lump in the fourth quarter. Is that a reasonable explanation of what you are seeing?
John D. Clayton
Yes. I appreciate the question and I'll try to kind of give you how we think about it, but a real good way to find out how we answer it is whether you're right on not, so I mean I'll try to be careful in answering it. We're managing all these assets for the long term. So when we decide to defer a Briscoe Ranch to the second half of the year because our teams come forward and say "Hey, guys, we have a much better way to do this." We act on that, but I think, now to kind of give you some guidance on what you asked, yes, the Adele Dubose wells in the Karnes Trough area, I think, we just drilled out the last one of those last week, and so we're already into August. So those were not on for the full month of July. The line looping project is complete, but as those things work their way through the system, it takes a while to get pressures to come down in the field after those projects are complete. That was not complete at the end of June, which was at the end of the second quarter. We don't manage it from a micro-standpoint like that. I understand why you guys do it, but we kind of look out long term and when we make a decision to put a line looping project in to try to get fuel gathering pressures down, that's the right thing to do for the long term. And so irregardless of when that occurs in the quarter of the year, we try to make that decision prudently, but I think all your assumptions on that were pretty accurate. The Adele Dubose is on now. It was not on at the end of June. The same for the shutdowns that we had at Gates. So I think you're heading in the right direction.

Our next question is from Will Green of Stephens.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
I wonder if we could stick on the Permian for a minute. What's -- when we think about the standard vertical test that's been done into the Wolfbone, how many stages have gone into the Bone versus the Wolfcamp? Do you see any need to vary that at all going forward? Is it a stick on, kind of a standard completion?
John D. Clayton
This is Clayton again. So one of the things we're doing, if you actually look and pull some public data and you looked at, okay, well, where are these guys drilling their wells. We drilled a couple of wells in the western area too. At the time of the deal, we say we really didn't value because we statistically could make the economics work on those. So I'll give you a little insight on how our team looks at it. We've got a gross column, it's well north of 1,000 feet and this column is interbedded, especially when you get up into the Bone Spring interval, it has hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs and it has wet bearing reservoirs. So our teams are trying to go in there and do the sub-surface work in order for us to not just minimize the number of stages across a larger gross interval, but actually target the intervals that will have a much larger percentage of hydrocarbons and keep the water production out of the zone. So I'm dancing around your question because the work that we're doing now going forward will be for us to determine, not only what part of that 1,000 plus column do we target on stimulating, but in parts of the areas, especially the west, which parts do we stay away from that we know are wet. However, there could be oil above and below it and how do we complete that. So right now, we're really not focused on contacting more gross rock with fewer stages as much as the teams are trying to focus on which ones are more conduits for hydrocarbon production to minimize the water production that's interbedded in that gross area. So I would ask to give us a few more quarters and let us fine tune the completion techniques on the vertical. We are completing, some operators haven't done in the past, but we are completing the Bone Spring interval like you mentioned. So that is something that we're doing today. But it's not as simple as take the whole 500-foot column and bust it all up, because some of the sands have water in it. And we're trying to stay away from that to keep our operating cost down. And it will just take a lot more wells than the handful we drilled so far to figure that out. But it's a good question.
Will Green - Stephens Inc., Research Division
That's great color. And I wonder if we could stick on that theme for a minute and maybe talk about have you guys looked at oil in place across kind of west to east in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp? And I know it's obviously there's -- it's a lot more complicated than that. But how does that vary as you go west to east and then thickness as well, what -- how does the thickness change as you go west to east in all of this columns?
John D. Clayton
Without getting into a whole lot of the geology of it, our team members listening will probably say, well, he doesn't all of the stuff. But here's how we look at it. Early on, we realized across our entire position of Reeves County, we've got over 100 million barrels of oil equivalent in place per square mile. If you look at the type curves that we laid out on a typical well, and those were completed across a fairly large gross interval, our recovery factors are less than 5%. I think if you do the math on it, it's like 3.8%. So what our technical guys are working on now is not to just understand is there enough hydrocarbons in place across the interval, it's really more, let's break out that gross section and then instead of looking at 1,500-foot of rock, let's break it out into subsections and calculate the hydrocarbons in place for, let's say, the upper Bone Springs, or the lower Bone Springs. And then try to ascertain through the completion technique how much hydrocarbons are coming out of that particular frac stage into that interval to calculate real recovery factors as opposed to just take an EUR of a well that completed a 1,500 gross split interval. So does the thickness vary from east to west? It does, but it also varies by different benches of the Wolfcamp and also benches of the Bone Springs. And they're not all, I'll say, parallel to each other in thickening. Some thicken where others thin and some thin where others thicken. And that's what's really intriguing about the entire play when we started looking at areas of the Permian that we would target for acquisitions, was with complexity in an area that offers a lot of hydrocarbons in place comes a tremendous amount of opportunity and so that's what our teams are working on right now. So give us time and we'll start breaking out I think a lot more detail on what intervals we're targeting through completion techniques, so, there are several quarters in front of us, as we learn more and more about recovery factors. So appreciate it.

Our next question is from Welles Fitzpatrick with Johnson Rice.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Is it safe to assume that if you guys do that horizontal towards the end of the year, it's going to be not like Gaucho on Balmorhea it'll be an upper Wolfcamp?
John D. Clayton
I think so, Welles. As you know both of those were in the upper Wolfcamp. There's been some fixed bent [ph] in the lower Wolfcamp through horizontal activity in the area. The results seem to be more favorable to the upper Wolfcamp. But I wouldn't just -- I wouldn't focus solely on the Wolfcamp for horizontal applications out here. I mean there are some intervals, as you get above the Wolfcamp into the Bone Springs, that also look like as time goes on, will be tested for horizontal applications as well. But right out of the chute with the large acreage position we've got, we've got the Gaucho well, we've got the Concho well that I talked about and those things are pretty far apart. And so I think we probably test an upper Wolfcamp in another area of our acreage position, but that's probably good analogy.
Welles W. Fitzpatrick - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division
Okay. And then just 1 follow-up, it sounds like that horizontal, especially with the ramp to 6 rig doesn't going to impact any of the 5-acre down spacing, but can you give us a little bit of an outline on that program? I'm sure it's not all mapped out but given the variability east to west, how many of those tests are you going to try and get down by year end? And do you think it will be kind of 6 to 12 months before you have the confidence to apply it to the actual development program?
John D. Clayton
Yes. I may have misunderstood you. I thought you said some like 5 acres, but so as we develop the asset in the Permian, if you just looked at well density divided by acres across Reeves County, it's spaced pretty broadly. The field rules happen to be 40 acres. But as we all know, if you gather data, you can apply for tighter spacing. Our goal now is to do some true 40 acres spacing tests and those are underway and then to do 20-acre space test. So in other words, let's say, 5 wells that cover 100 acres. And then we can study that center well. And I think you're dead on. In order for us to do that, we've got to one, get the density of wells. Our teams like to see what rock is being stimulated, microseismic will play an important role in that. And then overtime, we've got to monitor bottomhole pressures and reservoir interference and drainage patterns. And that does take, depending upon the rock and the rock type, it takes several months, if not, 1 year or 2. So I think you're time frame is correct. We don't have any plans though, if I did hear you right, to test 5-acre down spacing. I think right now, we're focused on some pure 40-acre space pilots and then some 20-acre space pilots.

Our next question is from Irene Haas of Wunderlich Securities.
Irene O. Haas - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division
If I can ask 2 questions, the first one really has to do with the same thing, the Reeves County. It looks like it's going to take more time to properly map the details to take a fair [ph] and understand the hydrology as such. And I was wondering, how much overpressure, Bone Spring, you actually have in your property. Then, any sense of how far this play would extend, does it go into Pecos County? And then my second question is really natural gas outlook, liquids outlook for the third quarter. How do you guys feel about going into the third quarter?
James E. Craddock
Irene, this is John Clayton, I'll take the first one. Yes, the lower Bone Springs, the third Bone Springs has a much higher pressure gradient than the first and second Bone Springs. So I mean, I guess, that's how I would look at it, as you start getting into the third Bone Spring, you start transitioning into the same pressure gradients that we've got in the Wolfcamp intervals. So maybe 2/3 of the Bone Springs is slightly less pressured gradient than what we see in the lower Bone Springs in the Wolfcamp. As far as the gross interval across the Bone Springs area, I think in some areas, and don't quote me exactly on this, but it's as much as 500 or 600 feet. So it's a fairly large thick interval. There are some wet benches in there, specially as you move towards the west. And then there's quite a bit of hydrocarbons in there too. So I think you're right. Just give us some time and we'll start understanding. We like to group these rocks from a geologic standpoint into single names like Bone Springs and Wolfcamp. And when we drill down detail wise, we may even bust it up in the first, second first and third. But when our technical guys look at this they really don't approach it that way. It's a lot more complicated than that, trying to figure out where the oil is and where the water is.
James E. Craddock
Irene, I would just want add, I mean I think the way we behave in the Eagle Ford is how you can expect us to behave in the Permian. And we started drilling Discovery wells, late 2009, at Gates Ranch, over the course of the next maybe 16, 18 months, we drilled 10 or 12 wells there that touched [ph] on all the corners of the ranch. We did early on, a 2 well pad that we did microseismic on and started taking a look at well spacing. We did all that in the first couple of years, and then we began development. And even then, after maybe 1 year of development on 100-acre spacing, we said there's an update on that, that tells us that we need to lower that spacing and increase well density. We're planning on doing all those things here, with the added factor of there's vertical wells that look very commercial to us but there's horizontal wells that look intriguing too. And so you can add into that, our plans are over next year to test both verticals on pattern [ph] spacing but also begin testing horizontals and understanding what the right mix is going to be. It's very possible, 40,000 acres in Reeves County that some portion of this we'll decide is long-term vertical development, and some portion of this we decide as long-term horizontal development. We don't know yet. But we're going to begin doing the legwork we've got to do to figure all that out. I think your second question was on NGL pricing. So I think Hagale is going to address that.
John E. Hagale
I will answer that, Irene. And I'm not sure I have any better crystal ball than anybody else, but if you look at the forward curve, it looks like the second half of the year NGL prices, $31, $32 a barrel. One thing I would note is we continue to have pretty good hedge position for this year. I think 7,500 barrels a day hedged at around $42 a barrel and then for '14, we've got 5,000 barrels a day hedged at $41 a barrel. I hope that answers your question.
James E. Craddock
I believe we have time for maybe 1 more question.

Our next question is from Matt Portillo of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Matthew Portillo - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Just 2 quick questions for me. In terms of the Titan[ph] well you mentioned and also the Gaucho well, I was hoping that you can give a little bit more color on just how you view the 30-day IPs or how those wells are hanging in versus expectation? And then a second question just on the vertical drilling program. Can you talk a little about the well cost, how the AFEs are trending? And then as you think about this play versus the Midland vertical wells, how should we think about the difference in those well costs and maybe where you see the technical limitations in terms of D&C cost here?
John D. Clayton
Matt, this is Clayton, good question. The Gaucho well has been on now, it's coming up on I think 4 months. And although we haven't published the type curve for Upper Wolfcamp benches publicly just because there's a great deal of uncertainty around it, we've got an internal type curve that we track these wells on. And the Gaucho well is still outperforming the type curve and I think if you look at some of the type curves in some very broad assumptions on the well cost and the shape of the curve, we're targeting something in the 30% rate of return type area on the type curve. And so far, it's been outperforming it. The Tycoon [ph] well has not been on as long and I think there's a conference call tomorrow that may give more detail on it but it's actually outperforming the Gaucho well by a little bit. But it's -- I mean I'll caution it's extremely early. But that well also looks very good and I think as the crow flies, I actually didn't check this number before the call, but I bet it's 15 miles between the Gaucho well and the Tycoon [ph] well. It's right across our leasehold so they are 2 wells that we're very interested in. I think as Welles mentioned on his question, they're both Upper Wolfcamp wells. So both wells, although earlier, are outperforming the type curve. On cost on vertical wells on the Delaware side, a couple of things that we wanted to do, I think right now we're AFE-ing our wells and it's very early for right at $4 million. One of the things that we wanted to test, though, is could we get a well down and use 2 strings of pipe? And we have successfully done that. It'll take a few months to then run the cost through the accounting and see what all comes in but I think we're pretty pleased with the efforts that our teams have put to drive cost down to a $3.5 million targeted well cost for the area. There are some other operators in the vicinity that I think show their well cost over time, and last dozen or so wells are in the $3.5 million range. So I have no doubt our technical teams will get there. They're doing kind of like what we've done on everything. They're taking prudent steps on -- do you get a return for every $1 you spend on a well and if you do spend more money and get a better well result, then we've proven we'll do that in places like Gates, where we pump a lot more expensive profit. But we're about $4 million right now on how we're AFE-ing them. We'll know in about 3 months how the costs are coming in but I think maybe a good takeaway is, we've proven we can drill these areas once we've got the information on the rock, and not have to set 3 strings of pipe in all the areas.
James E. Craddock
And I would just add, I mean, a reminder to everyone, we're at 6 days out of the transition period. So now we're fully operating out there, but we weren't earlier we were transitioning and so it's pretty early days. We would guide you to the $3.5 million well cost. We think it's very achievable. And we're not saying we're there today, but we think we will be in fairly short order.
