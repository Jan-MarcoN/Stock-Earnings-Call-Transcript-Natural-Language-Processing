Ladies and gentlemen, please standby, the conference will begin momentarily. We thank you for your patience and we ask you, please remain on the line. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the IMS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, Tuesday, February 3, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Kinsley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Kinsley
Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss IMS Healthâs 2014 fourth quarter and full year performance. With me today are Ari Bousbib, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Bruehlman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today weâll be referencing a presentation that will be visible during this call for those of you on our Web Site. The presentation will also be available following this call on our Events and Presentation section of the Investor Relations Web Site. The Investor Relations Web Site is easily found in the top right-hand corner of our Web Site, imshealth.com. 
Before we begin our prepared remarks, Iâd like to remind all of you that some of the information contained in this presentation may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include comments about our guidance, our pending transaction with Cegedim, and our expectations and prospects, and are based on our views as of today, February 3, 2015. Any such statements and projections reflect various estimates and assumptions by management concerning anticipated results. Whether or not any such statements or forward-looking statements or projections are in fact achieved will depend upon future events, some of which are not within the control of the company. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results and such variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to correct or update these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
During this presentation, weâll refer to certain non-GAAP measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and unlevered free cash flow. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information regarding our performance. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP measures aid in assessing our operating performance trends by excluding certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items, and certain other adjustments we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance. These non-GAAP measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our computations may vary from those used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. 
Now Iâll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Ari Bousbib.
Ari Bousbib
Thank you, Tom. Good morning everyone. Iâd like to thank you all for joining our 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. Today we are pleased to share with you our fourth quarter as well as full year 2014 results and provide guidance for 2015. You will recall that the full year 2014 constant currency guidance we had provided on our first quarter earnings call was for 5.5% to 5.7% revenue growth and 9% to 9.8% adjusted EBITDA growth. I am the happy to report we achieved or outperform the guidance. For the full-year we grow revenue 5.9% and adjusted EBITDA 9.5% with the margins increasing over 100 basis points during the year.
The fourth quarter was essentially a continuation of our strong performance during the first three quarters. Revenue grew 6.2% and adjusted EBITDA increased 8.5% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, revenue growth was 5% at constant currency. We are truly a global business as over half of our revenues are in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and as you know most of the currencies continued to weaken versus the dollar during the fourth quarter and on into 2015, increasing the currency headwind in our reported results. Ron will discuss the details of these currency impacts.
On a constant currency basis Technology Services grew a healthy 13.6% in the quarter with a particularly strong performance in our technology and applications as well as Real-World Evidence offerings. Information offerings grew a little less than 1%. Emerging market revenue increased about 10% and developed markets grew 5.5% before the impact of FX. Our Nexus suite of applications continue to build momentum in the quarter, a couple of examples, top five pharma company signed a deal to use our Nexus marketing and Nexus performance applications to automate and monitor their global marketing campaign. 
Our service specialists first help them define the global metrics that we use to measure success for these campaigns and then we installed our solution to automate these processes. They are now rolling out the solutions in 13 countries around the world. Another example is a win-win, one of the leading biotech companies that signed on to use our Nexus social media application which has enabled them to monitor the multiple channels of their patient support program across seven countries. It allows the client to fulfil regulatory requirements by ensuring that adverse events are identified, and captured and reported in a systematic way. 
During 2014 we also rolled out our new analytics platform. We call it AnalyticsLink. It helps pharma companies develop sophisticated insights about markets and diseases. Pharma companies have traditionally relied on a broad set of companies for these types of business intelligence tools and analytics services. I want to note that over the last 12 months, 93 clients subscribed to our new platform. 29 of these had never purchased analytics solutions from us before. These winds illustrate the capability, breadth and geographic presence of our offerings and how they are aligned to the real challenges that our clients face. 
Now before handing it off to Ron, I briefly discuss the status of Cegedim acquisition. You will recall that during the third quarter we finalized the works council consultation requirements, we received Cegedim board approval and we signed a purchase agreement. In the fourth quarter the transaction was approved by regulatory authorities in both the U.S. and in Europe. And as part of that approval we are required to divest our $2 million promotional audit business in Europe prior to closing. We expect to do that in the first quarter. And Iâm pleased to report that we are therefore on track to close the transaction early in the second quarter of 2015. 
Now because of the dramatic change in the value of the Euro the numbers in dollars are different from what we previously discussed regarding Cegedim. So, retranslating Cegedimâs 2013 financials, at the current FX rates results in acquired revenue of $491 million, adjusted EBITDA of $74 million and a purchase price of $434 million. The purchase price and the revenue and EBITDA numbers remain the same at Euro rates, but because of this dramatic change in Euro versus Dollar exchange rates we wanted to update what they translate into in U.S. dollar versus what we gave you in June when we announced the transaction. 
The more we learn about this deal and the more we like it. There are impressive capabilities within Cegedim, most importantly there are talented people that we would be bringing into IMS and we will significantly enhance the value proposition we bring to market, to our clients around the world. 
And I would like to turn it over to Ron Bruehlman our Chief Financial Officer to take you through the financials in more detail.
Ronald Bruehlman
Thanks Ari, good morning everyone. As Ari mentioned we finished the year on strong note. Revenue in the fourth quarter increased 6.2% on a constant currency basis. Of course the continued weakening of key foreign currencies against the dollar had a significant impact on our results, with revenue growing 0.6% on a reported basis. The two largest currency impacts for the quarter were from the weakening of the Euro and the Japanese Yen. And in addition to that our re-evaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar at June 30 of this year, excuse me of 2014 trended up 70 basis points off of our reported growth rate. 
Our strong constant currency revenue growth was again driven by our technology services offering, which increased 13.6% with continued solid double-digit growth in real-world evidence in technology and application. At actual FX rates overall technology services revenue still grew 8.8%. Information revenue was up 0.8% constant currency reflecting growth in emerging markets. On a reported basis, information revenue declined by 5.5%. Growth in developed markets was 5.5% constant currency and just short of 1% of reported rate while revenue in emerging markets increased 9.7% of constant currency for the quarter. 
On a reported basis emerging markets revenue declined by one percentage point with a significant re-evaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar responsible for more than a third of the unfavorable FX impact. 
Turning to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter with 214 million which was up 8.5% constant currency or 1.1% reported compared with the prior year quarter. For the quarter our adjusted EBITDA margin grew 68 basis points constant currency and margins continue to grow despite the dilutive impact from higher revenue growth and technology services as we execute against our cost reduction initiative including transitioning work to our low-cost development centers overseas. On a reported basis adjusted EBITDA margin grew 18 basis points to 31.6%. 
Moving down to P&L on a reported basis our fourth quarter pretax income was 53 million compared with a pretax loss of 42 million last year and the difference was due primarily to lower interest expense in 2014 and from non-cash FX related losses in 2013. Youâll recall that we use the IPO proceeds to retire our high-cost debt effectively reducing our annualized interest expense by about 50%. 
GAAP net income was $8 million during the quarter compared with 82 million in the fourth quarter 2013. This decline reflected a large non-cash tax benefit that we reported in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the restructuring of IMSâs foreign operations. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.03 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.29 in the prior year. Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter was a 125 million compared to 79 million in the prior year, an increase of 70% at constant currency and 58% at actual currency rates. Lower interest expense in growth and adjusted EBITDA were the main drivers of the improvement. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.36 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.28 in 2013 reflecting the increase in adjusted net income I just mentioned partially offset by a higher average share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding increased from 286 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, to 346 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due mainly to the issuance of new shares at the time our IPO. FX had a negative impact of $0.03 per share versus the prior year. 
Letâs go to the full-year results right now and youâll recall that when we updated our 2014 guidance during third quarter earnings call we used foreign-currency exchange rates as of late October. The U.S. dollar continued to strengthen during the fourth quarter, however, despite this we performed well versus our full-year guidance both on a constant currency and a reported basis. Full-year revenue exceeded $2.6 billion an increase of 5.9% constant currency and 3.8% reported. This performance was above our constant currency guidance and within the range of our reported guidance despite the further strengthening of the dollar versus our basket of foreign currencies. For the year technology services revenue was up 12.3%, emerging markets increased 10.8% at constant currency. 
Full-year adjusted EBITDA was 878 million up 9.5% constant currency and 5.8% reported, both within the guidance range as we provided on our third quarter call. The GAAP net loss of a 189 million and diluted loss per share of $0.59 primarily reflected IPO related expenses. Adjusted net income was 454 million up 23.6% on a constant currency basis and 18% reported, both above our guidance ranges. 
Year-over-year improvement was driven by lower interest expense and higher adjusted EBITDA partially offset by a large U.S. federal income tax refund in 2013 that did not recur this year. Itâs worth noting that adjusted net income included a $5 million benefits from foreign royalty hedges and another $1 million benefit from the natural hedge provided by the interest expense on our Euro denominated term loan, which carry a principal amount of slightly under $900 million euro. Adjusted diluted earnings per-share was $1.37 for the full year up 6.9% constant currency and 1.9% reported versus $1.34 of last year with the comparison reflecting the growth and adjusted net income partially offset by the higher share count related to the IPO. Now, letâs go to the balance sheet for a few minutes and then weâll be on to the guidance. 
At the end of 2014 cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments totaled 390 million and debt was 3.8 billion resulting in a net debt of 3.4 billion. Our year-end gross leverage ratio improved to 4.3 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA or 1.8 turns lower than year-end 2013. Cash flow from operations increased to 147 million during the fourth quarter from 78 million last year. In fourth quarter unlevered free cash flow grew to a 182 million or 85% of adjusted EBITDA versus a 140 million on last yearâs fourth quarter which included a $25 million down payment on the building we purchased to house our global delivery center in Bangalore. 
Full-year unlevered free cash flow was 576 million versus 617 million in 2014. After adjusting for $31 million of 2014 expenditures to complete the purchase and set out of the Bangalore global delivery center, unlevered free cash flow was about 70% of adjusted EBITDA in 2014. And youâll recall that we discussed on our third quarter call that 2014 cash flow was affected not just by the expenditures on the Bangalore delivery center, but also increased product development investment to grow the business and other factors such as significant prepayments to vendors upon signing certain strategic contracts.
Before I provide guidance for 2015 weâll take a minute to recap the FX impact during 2014. Changes in our basket of foreign-currencies versus the dollar, particularly the sharp strengthening of the dollar in the fourth quarter along with the re-evaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar at the end of the second quarter significantly impacted our 2014 results. The dollar strengthened further in January and this trend will impact 2015 as I will discuss on the next two slides covering the guidance. One thing to bear in mind is that the FX comparison will be toughest in the first half of 2015 and there are a couple of reasons. 
First, the dollar strengthened versus our key currencies mostly in the second half of 2014 and it continued to strengthen in January. Second, we wonât pass the anniversary the Venezuelan Bolivar re-evaluation until the end of the second quarter. Now, ordinarily at this point I would provide quarterly impacts for foreign currency for the entire year of 2015 to help you calendarize your estimate. However, a lot is going to change with the Cegedim acquisitions, so today Iâm providing the impact only for the first quarter of 2015 which will be our final quarter prior to the acquisition. Weâll provide FX impacts for the remaining quarters of 2015 once the Cegedim transaction closes. 
For the first quarter specifically using current foreign exchange rates we expect FX to impact revenue by 840 basis points and adjusted EBITDA by 960 basis points. Of course, currency rates are sure to move from current rates, youâll recall that on the third quarter call to help you calibrate the impact of currency changes we told you how a 1% change in the value of the dollar versus other currencies would impact IMSâs revenue. Weâre now updating these numbers to include the impact of the Cegedim acquisition. And how it looks is that a percentage point move versus the dollar and the value of the Euro, either upward or downward results now in about an $8 million to $9 million impact on a reported full-year revenue. For the Yen, each point is worth about $3 million and for all other currencies itâs about $8 million. So, the total impact on our revenue assuming that all currencies move together versus the dollar by 1%, which is obviously a hypothetical scenario, would be $19 to $20 million. And again, these are updated numbers to include Cegedim. 
Now, letâs turn to the guidance. Obviously 2015 is a somewhat complex year to model as we have to consider the impact of both the major acquisition and also a significant foreign exchange headwind. So for 2015, letâs start off with numbers we can provide with most certainty. And thatâs the guidance for, the core IMF business that being IMF excluding the impact of the Cegedim asset acquisition, on a constant currency basis, this is the first column of the numbers on our guidance slides. On this basis we expect full-year of 2015 revenue growth of 5% to 6% with about a point of acquisition impact. This is a consistent with our medium term guidance and actually on the higher end. Weâre projecting adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. 
Our guidance also assumes continued increases in investments to grow the business. For core IMSâs at constant currency, weâre also projecting adjusted net income growth of 16% to 19% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 11% to 14%. Note that the adjusted diluted EPS growth is lower than the adjusted net income growth due to a full-year at a higher share count as a result of the IPO. Now, that weâre on a path to close the Cegedim deal in April, we think it is appropriate to also provide guidance including Cegedim, CRM strategic data businesses. We donât have perfect information for instance Cegedim hasnât yet reported 2014 second half earnings. But we made a number of assumptions based on what we do now. 
On a combined basis IMS per Cegedim, and a constant currency, this is the middle column of our chart, we expect revenue at 19%to 20% which we derived simply by adding a partial year of Cegedim revenue to be IMS core revenue. Adjusted EBITDA growth on this basis will be 13% to 14%, of our growth rate and revenue because Cegedimâs margin are less than half of our and in this rates is precisely why we like the acquisition because it provides ample opportunity for improvement. Adjusted net income growth will be 20% to 23% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth will be 15% to 18%
Moving now to the third column, this is the combined company on a reported basis and assuming exchange rates remain at todayâs level for the balance of the year, revenue growth will be 11% to 12%, adjusted EBITDA growth will be 5% to 6%, again that revenue growth due to Cegedimâs lower margin, our adjusted net income growth will be 8% to 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth will be 4% to 6%. Now forth we will refine and update this guidance as necessary upon closing the transaction and at that point we will also provide guidance for the combined company for unlevered free cash flow.
So, in summary we had another strong quarter which casted an excellent year. Our full year performance included continued double-digit constant currency revenue growth from our fastest-growing business, technology services. Within technology services there was notable strength in technology and applications in Real-World Evidence with both reporting solid double-digit growth on a constant currency basis. Within technology and applications, specifically our IMS-One Intelligent cloud and Nexus suite of commercial applications made considerable inroads with our existing customer base which provides further evidence of our success expanding our addressable market.
Our cost reduction focus enabled us to increase the adjusted EBITDA margins by over 100 basis points at constant currency as we continue to leverage the scale we built in low-cost centers of excellence, and also as we continue to drive the performance culture throughout the business. And for 2015, simply what weâre expecting more of same, that is strong and consistent financial performance. Closing the Cegedim transaction will provide a further acceleration to our strategy if we execute on the integration plan, realize cost synergies, leverage the tremendous technical resources at Cegedim and expand our offerings to clients. 
And with that I will ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik
The first question is you mentioned to us in the end that that there is increasing investments to grow the business, but if I look at sort of, if I did the math that is the constant currency ex-Cegedim EBITDA margin implied in the guidance actually shows the material improvement, I was trying to, if you would help us reach that gap, just in comments around what the ex-Cegedim business is doing that?
Ari Bousbib
Good morning Manav. This is Ari, I may be wrong, what is the question -- I think we provided the revenue growth 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITDA growth 7.5% to 8.5%. You are asking why this so strong?
Manav Patnaik
Just the implied margin is improving despite I guess your comments on increased investment, I just wanted to know what the moving parts that were?
Ari Bousbib
Right, so the moving parts are, everything else being equal, we normally should have adjusted EBITDA growth lower than our revenue growth, and the reason for that is as you know the 5% to 6% is a little bit on the higher end of our medium term guidance which is up with single-digit. And that implies that we are accelerating investments to support a higher growth and it also implies that weâre growing in technology services which as we know do have somewhat lower margins than our data business, and as a result everything else being equal, adjusted EBITDA growth because of higher investments and because of faster growth in tech services should be lower than revenue growth. 
But in fact itâs not just the same. Itâs actually higher because we continue to take cost out of the business. Iâve said before and Iâll say it again our cost containment and cost reduction is not the one-time exercise. Itâs a culture and itâs an ongoing process we have built, the number of mechanisms within the organization that will enable us to sustain that culture of cost containment well into the future. And as a result we anticipate that we will continue to expand margin. 
Now I donât know that we will expand margins and the same rate every year because sometimes we decide to accelerate investment even higher or because maybe sometimes we will make an acquisition that comes -- by the way thatâs a third headwind, right, where we make all these small acquisitions generally to our core capabilities, they come with zero profits. So they generally are also dilutive to our models. So if we decided to buy a company that has losses then we may end up expanding margins less. We might promise to you that people continue to expand margins, whether it to be 10 basis points or 100 basis points I donât know for sure, but in the medium term, but certainly for this year we anticipate strong margin expansion.
Manav Patnaik
Okay and just on the tech services, clearly some good momentum again with some of the contract examples you gave, 13.6. for this quarter; I guess what, like should we carry that momentum or maybe the full-year number into for the full-year â15 and should there be any -- you talked about how itâs been lumpy before, are there anything to point out in any given quarter that we should be aware of when we model that?
Ari Bousbib
Look, these are, itâs going to bounce around. For the year it was a little bit over 12%, one. 12.3% to or 12.4% something like that which is very good. You should ask be in the beginning of the year, I would have said itâs going to be 10% to 12%, so itâs a little bit on the higher end of what I would have expected. Some of you guys were a little concerned because it looked like it was declining at the rate of growth in the second and third quarter, but again these are small variations. I donât know that you should derive strong conclusions one way or the other. And taking around up the quarters doesn't mean much. Hopefully, the 13.6% growth shows that it will bounce around and tomorrow if itâs 11 instead or 12, then nothing to be around them.
Manav Patnaik
And just one housekeeping one, if you allow, 5% to 6% constant currency ex-Cegedim, that still includes about 1% impact from small deals?
Ari Bousbib
Yes, thatâs correct.
Operator
Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan
Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the customer base, can you give any indication of which types are growing more with you than others? Are you seeing more growth from your major Pharma companies are biotech or consumer health companies etc.
Ari Bousbib
Yes, good morning Toni. Your question is specifically about tech services growth? 
Toni Kaplan
Yes.
Ari Bousbib
And penetration, yes. So we have said before that we have at least one or more application modules of the Nexxus suite of tech and apps, with most of our large Pharma clients. I think it is 19 out of 20. I try to remember, I donât, 19 out of 20 where we find faster success in deploying the entire suite on our IMS One cloud, obviously with medium and smaller sized Pharma. And the reasons for that I think will be self-evident and that these has -- large pharma has invested infrastructure, IT staffs -- itâs typically a more solid type of organization requires much more time for decision-making, proceeds at a more conservative base, have established long-standing relationships above the broader contracts with other multiple vendors to provide those services and technologies. 
Midsize Pharma is more agile, more eager to embrace technology to generate efficiency and to accelerate growth, typically midsize Pharma as you know grows at a faster rate itself and therefore they need to support their growth as they enter new markets, growth new drives, and so outsourcing to us are broader suite of applications for us to manage the majority of that commercial operations more specific brand is more likely. So the answer to your question is with respect to specific applications, is the same, to our pharma or midsized pharma across the board. With respect to the entire suite our value proposition is easier sold, faster welcomed, as to more a midsized pharma.
Toni Kaplan
Okay, and then just one follow-up. So you are just below, maybe four times net debt to forward EBITDA right now, but once Cegedim closes youâre probably roughly around the four times level depending on how much you take on. Please talk about how youâre thinking about leverage, shall we still think of it as you are going to manage paying down like half turn a year?
Ari Bousbib
Post Cegedim will be about levels on our leverage ratio because we are financed most likely with the mixed cash and that. So it shouldnât have much of an impact on our leverage ratio. You have noticed that the leverage ratio has been trending down over time as our EBITDA grows, and we do have some small mandatory repayments on a term loan. But that said we are very comfortable with our leverage in the fours, particularly with interest where they are now. So we donât have an explicit strategy of deleveraging. Where we want to go with our cash is reinvestment in the business and also adding capabilities through continued acquisition. And after that the second call on our cash is of total people would be to return cash to share owners rather than to pay down debt further. But we are making the Cegedim acquisition now in April and for the time being anyway thatâs going to consume some cash and we will revisit the cash deployment strategy post acquisition of Cegedim.
Operator
Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.
Robert Willoughby
Hey Ari and Ron, your experts some optimism about being able to boost that Cegedim profit margin, have you assumed any contribution from those efforts this year and whatâs the ultimate target there? Can it approach -- the margin approach that of your core business?
Ari Bousbib
We have said in year one we donât expect to realize any synergy, but we expect to realize about $50 million of synergy by the end of year three on an annualized basis with the synergies coming in year two and three. So initially in the first year post acquisition we wouldnât expect to make much impact on Cegedimâs margin. Thereafter I think it will be a substantial impact. There margins right now are less than half of ours, and if you are adding the synergies that we are expecting, you see that itâs not quite up our margins, but much closer than the IMS current margins. And of course post year three will continue working on Cegedim cost structure and improving their margin. They do have lower information content than IMS which had some structural impact on their margins, but there is no reason that they can be a lot closer to our existing margins than they are right now.
Robert Willoughby
Okay, interest to cash tax rate for 2015, Ron?
Ronald Bruehlman
Cash tax rate weâve assumed going forward and this would apply â15, â16, â17 up until we get to 2019 and at which point depending on what acquisitions we made in the meanwhile, weâre projecting will have utilized our foreign tax credits and carry-forwards for that period you should expect cash tax rates as a percentage of cash pretax income to be in the high teens. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Appert of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. 
Peter Appert
So Ari, can you call out in terms of the slight deceleration in growth you saw in information services line?
Ronald Bruehlman
Peter, not really. You know we have 90% of our revenue and information as recurring, but there is a 10% component to that which is adhoc and it does bounce around some. What weâve said is that information should grow low single-digits, some quarters thatâll be 3%, some quarters that will be 2% and some quarters like this one will be 1%. It was just be a combination of small things, moving in one direction or the other either forward or backwards from a timing perspective. And I donât think thereâs anything gleaned from a trend perspective and a slightly slower growth
Ari Bousbib
I mean, if I may, I think Ron is correct. Peter, may be the macro trend that you need to bear in mind is that there is still some lingering effect on our information business from the product that lost exclusivity in mature markets. So, still in 2014 we have some of that in the numbers hopefully in account will wind itself out. But that may be was part of why we had less of the end of year data purchases that typically occur, so that may have been a little bit of an impact, if youâre really looking for some trend.
Peter Appert
Got it and then just on the gross margin 
Ari Bousbib
And then maybe Iâm sorry, just to complete also, again most of the growth on our information business as you know I mentioned the mature market that most of the growth comes from the emerging markets and we had -- China is coming back but maybe not as fast as we had anticipated. You will recall that China which had been growing in 2010-2013 upwards of 20% a year, suddenly dropped after the GSK scandal in China and the bribery issues and so on, and then it dropped. I think it was 9% that quarter when it happened, 9% growth, and we were hoping it would get back to above 20% kind of range, but it has rebounded but not quite there. I think we are in the mid double digit for 14% to 15% kind of growth in China. And so that also maybe is a little bit of what is causing slightly our information rate being 1âish percent as opposed to 2âish percent.
Peter Appert
Okay. Thatâs helpful, thanks. And with those factors also, then flow through to the gross margin which is just down a little bit on a full year basis?
Ari Bousbib
Yes. The short answer is yes, but thereâs plus and minus, Ron, you want to add something on that?
Ronald Bruehlman
Yes. There is a natural drag from information growing slower than technology services and you guys can do that the math but it work out to about 30 basis points to drag annually on our gross margin and weâve overcome that through cost reductions
Peter Appert
You said gross margin on information
Ronald Bruehlman
Gross margin on information, now whatâs driving gross margin on the information is, Iâm sorry I misunderstood your question, but it is the investments weâve been making in the business, for instance increased purchases, especially data, new data sources for Real-World Evidence and so forth that flow through information and those expands data immediately as we buy it and of course it takes a while particularly for new products and new areas to build the revenue to offset the cost of information and to turn it profitable. So thatâs impacting the information gross margin.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Kreger of William Blair. Please go ahead. 
John Kreger
Ari, hoping you could just give an update on the strategic discussions you had with some of your key clients. We are hearing that the industry is stretching pretty quickly towards specialty products particularly in the U.S. is that influencing the way you have been thinking about working with you and how they spend their marketing budgets with you? 
Ari Bousbib
Yes, it just shifted pretty quickly -- it is a traditional market for our information business. Itâs not like itâs -- there is no substitution here. What happens to be that most of the growth in the drug pipeline, is coming from specialty drugs. So obviously we are on it. We are on it in a number of ways. The first one is that we are rapidly expanding our coverage of specialty data capture, so more chows and more coverage, more countries, more specialties as you know it is very difficult. Itâs not the same type, not as easy as traditional data. Now the other significant way that we are changing the way we are working with our clients is captures in our Real-World Evidence offerings. 
We build customized data parts for our customers. This is a more integrated type of relationship. We donât just build database and throw it over the wall to our clients. We do these in a highly collaborative manner with our clients. We build for them on top of the data in analytics platform based on the specific metrics and requirements and the measurements that they need. And then we typically deals some intelligent applications, some BI tools, some software application to enable them to run their workflows on an ongoing basis and that becomes essentially three types of sales. We sell data, to smaller part of the value proposition because that [indiscernible] thatâs nothing for them. We sell analytic as services so there is a piece of labor, if you will. And then we sell software, thatâs licensed, and typically these are longer term relationships. 
We have got five years, seven years, we have seen some of the ones that we have focused out such as the AstraZeneca collaboration which we began working on a longer-term relationship with them. So the way we work with them in a much more collaborative, itâs on multiple levels, itâs data, itâs analytics and itâs technology. The relationship is multiyear and the value of the contract of course is much more significant. So the answer to your question is yes. The nature of the relationship is different and on multiple forms. And frankly we have a big advantage here because no one have the capability to provide data, analytics service and technology capabilities to bring to bear those multiple set of capabilities to a highly complex environment, to meet the clients objectives with deep-deep healthcare expertise on a global basis. 
John Kreger
Very helpful, thank you, just one another question. When weâve seen these significant moves in the dollar we have in the last six months, does that influence how your clients think about where theyâre spending their dollars around the world or is does it really have no impact?
Ari Bousbib
We havenât seen that, not at all, not in any.

Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel, please go ahead.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Just a quick kind of housekeeping thing. The constant currency EBITDA growth is 7.5% to 8.5%, just slightly lower than it would have expected from five to six years, and a longer-term growth was, I guess the guidance was 1.5 times. Is there anything to look into that, I know last year you guys accelerated a little bit of the investment spend; is there some of that going on as well just to drive longer-term revenue growth? Or how should I think of that?
Ari Bousbib
Okay, Shlomo, thank you for your question. Iâm not quite sure. I understand but I am sure, but I am just going to try to relate what you are saying. The answer for your question is in your question. You just said yourself that was our long-term guidance. We said we are going to grow mid single-digit and 1.5 times that rate of growth for adjusted EBITDA. That was our long-term guidance. That means on average it will be 1.5 times the rate of growth. In 2014 what was it Ron?
Ronald Bruehlman
It was a little bit of [indiscernible].
Ari Bousbib
I think it was something at 1.6 something. So maybe you want to have that question, why where we outside our guidance? So sometimes it may be 1.6, and sometimes it may be 1.4, and sometimes at maybe 1.7, sometimes maybe by 1.3. The 1.5 is a long-term directional trend. Thatâs your first question and that answer was in your question. The second point is for 2015 our guidance is 5% to 6% revenue growth and 7.5% to 8.5% EBITDA growth.
The midpoint of our revenue growth is 5.5%, 1.5 times 5.5 is what is what? Tom is doing the math here, 8.25%. 8.25% is within the 7.5% to 8.5%. So I think even with the commentary I just made, we are still within our guidance even in â15. And the third point is that I think what youâre doing, you are simply taking the high end of our revenue range which is 6, and a high end of our EBITDA growth, and youâre saying why did not climb? But I trust you. You get the first ones that I gave you; I mean it is pretty obvious. But the third point is, it is higher growth, 5% to 6% is higher than 4 to 5. And that means that technology services is going to be -- we expected technology services to grow a little faster.
I said before in response to my last question. He was asking the opposite question, why is it that your model is not going down or flat, but itâs going -- did you see the accreting margins despite higher growth, and the reason is again technology services is growing faster, lower margins thatâs more dilutive to our overall margin. I also said that we are accelerating or investment rate mostly in software development which is labor. And the third point is, I think Ron mentioned, we also making investments in the acquisition of strategic data for the specialty business, and all of that creates a headwind to our margins if you really-really want to stretch it to why are we not -- we are only 8.5 and not 9 of the higher end. But again we may be 5.5 and 8.5. These are ranges, they donât correspond necessarily linear. 
Shlomo Rosenbaum
I understand sort of way. Based on what your commentary, it seems like you are showing some evidence of pickup in momentum, and what youâre trying to do in terms of penetration of your base with the technology services, is that the right way to look at it? I know itâs an upper slot for being an information provider to technology and applications and your customer has to understand your role perhaps a little bit differently; do you feel like there is a pickup in momentum and making progress on that?
Ari Bousbib
I donât know about the word pickup, because that implies that there is an uptick generally. We as I said many times, could we accelerate our growth, I think we could. But thatâs not what we are about. We are about very long-term, embedded, deep and value adding relationships with our clients. What we are after is strong but steady growth well into the future, not quarterly or yearly impressive exponential pickups. So yes, is there momentum? Yes there is good momentum by definition. We started from a low base.
We introduced our Nexxus suite of applications very recently and some of those applications are companies we acquired in the past 12 to 18 months. So this is relatively new. So therefore itâs in the context of our large company, the small base and that is nice and healthy growth there. And I also said before, I repeated, our strategy is if you want for like of better terminologies, to land and expand once you have landed. So, once you buy an application from us, it becomes easier to buy another one because of the interoperability of these applications on our cloud-based platform. So simply from a technology standpoint and efficiency standpoint, once you penetrate the client then you can -- it becomes the barrier if you will, to penetrate the time for a second or a third application is lower. So youâre right, in that sense the more we land and the more we are able to expand and hopefully we can continue the momentum but remember we got a lot to do. We have to deliver, we have to execute. And we have to integrate a lot more new people in the large acquisitions, so I always want to make sure that we only take on that which we can deliver successfully and flawless.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Next question just on Cegedim margin. If this is correct that the EBITDA margin assumed in the guidance is about 13% for the year for the Cegedim revenue?
Ari Bousbib
The EBITDA margin that we are assuming is consistent with the EBITDA margin that you can calculate from the slide we shared for the year 2013 actually, so yes, around that.
Shlomo Rosenbaum
Okay, just then it might be a little bit lower, I thought it was more like 15% with year â13.
Ari Bousbib
Okay, can you take this up on a follow-up with Tom or [indiscernible]. Sholmo, thanks very much, because I am mindful of the time, we have another five minutes and we have a couple of questions in the queue. Tom you want toâ¦
Tom Kinsley
I think weâre going to go with this being the last question. So letâs do the one more, operator.
Operator
Our next question, can you put him through. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan, please go ahead your line is opened.
Andrew Steinerman
Ron, could you hear me? Ron, I wanted to check in at about that quick comment at the front page, 5% without acquisition, I think thatâs a 5% organic constant currency number for the quarter. I just wanted to verify that. And if I calculate that at 5%, about 8 million bucks coming from acquisition and you can imagine about as to what the organic growth was for tech services, and so if I assume that 8 million bucks all comes from tech services, thatâs about 11% organic from tech services. Did I see you right, did I do the math correctly?
Ari Bousbib
Yes what you heard, Ari, right on the organic growth and yes, the acquisition, with the tech services acquisition, so you can do your math on that.
Andrew Steinerman
Right, and it was about $8 million to $9 million, right. Thatâs how you get your 5% organic starting from [indiscernible].
Ari Bousbib
Iâm not telling you the math in more detail but you canât be far off given what we have given you in terms of numbers.
Andrew Steinerman
Perfect, like the same double-digit organic, thank you.
Tom Kinsley
Okay, thank you operator, and thank you everyone for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on the first quarter 2015 earnings call. In the meantime donât hesitate to contact me with follow-up questions. Iâll be available with Andrew Markwick and Reena Patel to take your question.
Operator
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect all lines. Thank you and have a good day.
