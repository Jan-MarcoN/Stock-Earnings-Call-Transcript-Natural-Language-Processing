Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the presentation of the results of the financial year 2014. Also, we are close to the end of the first quarter, we would like to summarize the previous year, and will focus in this call on the performance in 2014 only. Please be informed that the results for the first quarter will be released on 30th of April.
Today's call will be hosted by our CEO, Dr. Wolfgang Buchele; and by Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO.
I will now hand over to Dr. Wolfgang Buchele.
Wolfgang Buchele
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and a warm welcome to those who have not already followed the press conference earlier today. I would like to take you through today's agenda; we will start with a summary of the key parameters of our performance in 2014, followed by more details on our strategic focus. I will close with the outlook. Afterwards, Georg Denoke will give you more color on the operational and financial performance before he concludes with a summary of our approach regarding the use of the future cash flow. After this, we look forward to taking your questions.
On slide 4, you see the highlights of our performance in 2014. All of you will recall that 2014 was dominated by a couple of factors, and the resulting high level of uncertainty from a political, as well as from a macroeconomic perspective. At the beginning of last year, nobody has anticipated that a conflict in the Ukraine would escalate to the current extent, that the oil price could fall that low, or that a discussion of Greece leaving the Eurozone would revive.
In this quite challenging environment, we realized revenues of â¬17 billion, which is on a currency adjusted basis 4.5% above last year's level. We generated an operating profit of â¬3.9 billion, adjusted for currency impact, we saw an increase of 1%. This resulted in a Group margin of 23%. The lower margin is mainly the result of the higher share of our Engineering division in the revenue mix compared to the previous year.
The operating cash flow in 2014 was a clear highlight, and even exceeded the high level of last year. We generated â¬3.3 billion in operating cash flow. With â¬7.13, our EPS before non-recurring items was on the level of last year.
On a reported basis, EPS was 16% below the level of last year. In the third quarter, we had to realize for multiple reasons impairment losses on plans and in the fourth quarter, we took restructuring charges to further enhance our future efficiency.
I would like to move on to the development of revenue and operating profit by division on slide number 5. The exchange rate effect turned to our favor at the end of the fourth quarter. However, on a full year basis, we had a headwind of 2.6% in the Gases division. Therefore, revenues in the Gases division only grew by 0.1%, and totaled â¬14 billion. On a comparable basis, growth was 2.7%.
In the Engineering division, we are currently working on the execution of our high order backlog. This is reflected in the increase of revenues by 7.9%. The Gases division generated an operating profit of â¬3.8 billion. This is basically on the level of last year. At 27.4%, the margin remained on almost the same level as last year. The Engineering division realized an operating profit of â¬300 million, which is 6% below the very high level of last year. Due to the favorable project mix, the margin remained with 9.7%, well above the industry average and fully in line with our forecast of around 10%.
Following this brief summary on the performance, I will now move on to our strategic focus, which I have introduced to you already at our Capital Market day in October.
A few months back, I walked you through the four elements of our strategic plan for value generation, focusing on EBITDA, ROCE and shareholder return. 
I'd like to take the chance today to give you an update on our activities in each of the areas, starting with a refinement of our organizational setup on page 7. The rollout of our organizational refinement we introduced at our Capital Market day is now underway. Compared to the previous operating model, the definition of roles and responsibilities are now more clearly outlined in the refined operating model that is geared towards profitable growth by intensified customer focus.
For example, we have eliminated conflict of interest between different organizational units. Regional business units are now fully empowered to determine how to run their P&L. In contrast, the definition of standards and best practices will now be centralized in global governance centers, rather than split between the regional and global business units.
Last but not least, the very important activity of evaluating and deciding on business opportunities and investment projects is now firmly consolidated in our opportunity in project development office, where I personally oversee the end-to-end process of making sure capital is allocated to the most promising activities that best fit our strategic and financial goals.
With leaner structures and clearly defined responsibilities, the refined operating model will facilitate faster decision making, and a swifter implementation of projects, a faster and more focused product development, as well as a sharper marketing and sales strategies.
Let us now turn to the next slide that further details our restructuring initiatives. In addition to implementing the refined operating model, we are also in the midst of carrying out restructuring measures in the southern hemisphere, specifically in Australia, South Africa and Brazil, to adapt to the even more challenging economic situations in the respective countries. These measures already began in the fourth quarter of last year, with associated restructuring costs of â¬66 million. We expect the remaining measures to amount to around â¬90 million, and be completed within the first half of this year. On the other hand, we are already beginning to realize savings in 2015, and anticipate cumulative savings between â¬100 million and â¬120 million by the end of 2016.
Let me now move on to the next part in the strategic plan, continuous efficiency improvement. As part of our transformation into a learning organization, we are continually striving to improve our productivity. The end of 2014 marked the midpoint of our HPO-2 program and was â¬420 million of cross cost savings up to that point. We are very much on track to meeting our target of â¬750 million to â¬900 million by the end of 2016. An example of an HPO project that has contributed to these savings is explained in the next slide.
Under the umbrella of our continuous efficiency improvement, we developed a mobile solution for maintenance processes that we are currently rolling out in our North American business. A handheld tablet, that is collected to Linde's enterprise asset management systems forms the centerpiece of this initiative that will transform daily maintenance activity. Technicians using the mobile device will be able to access all relevant data, such as task lists and best practices, as well as data history right at the site. With this, we can ensure highest maintenance standards and accelerate related administration and reporting. Additionally, required spare parts will be request on-site, but the actual orders to third parties are centrally managed. Hereby, we are exploiting economies of scale, bundling our purchasing power and reduce related costs.
KPIs regarding plant operation, maintenance status and the like, can be accessed on a realtime basis to optimize maintenance planning and customer reporting. Overall, we are reducing maintenance spending and cost of downtime, while at the same time, optimizing procurement and inventory management. We expect savings of around â¬10 million in North America alone, and see significant additional potential across the Group. We refer to portfolio optimization as another cornerstone of our strategy.
The following slide shows how applications contribute to this goal. Applications are a significant component of our strategy, an important growth driver for multiple reasons. First and foremost, they raise the value proposition of our products, by not simply providing molecules for customer solutions.
Secondly, by differentiating ourselves from competitors with proprietary technologies, we drive customer loyalty. Certainly, applications also happen to be very synergistic. For example, knowhow can be transferred across industries, such as from developing [ph] to manufacturing. This is also an area, where our global footprint matters. Know-how accumulated in Europe in Chemicals, is also applicable to customers in Asia Pacific. These synergies allow us to turn our applications expertise into a broad reaching competitive advantage.
Because of these three factors, the share of merchant revenues, driven by tailored applications and solutions has risen from 30% to 40% between 2010 and 2014.
Let me give you an example of an important application in the metallurgy sector. LINDOFLAMM is a tailored solution for metal heating applications. Our Solution sales include burners, automation, as well as safety equipment, basically a complete solution. Within the LINDOFLAMM process, LPG or natural gas are substituted with acetylene as a high value gas to improve customer's productivity. Multiyear contract for acetylene cylinders, bundles and trailers, as well as ongoing indirection with customers, to maintain and expand the burner base lead to higher customer loyalty and additional supply contracts.
Within the Metallurgy segment, Linde has established global customer base, giving us the chance to further roll-out LINDOFLAMM that is also suitable for metal fabrication applications. Let us continue with the next page, by moving to the topic of investing a profitable growth.
We are strongly convinced of the long term future of industrial gases, and that the market will continue to grow for many years to come. For that reason, we invest in new opportunities for profitable future growth, albeit even more strategically selective about what we pursue.
The chart on the left side shows, the committed project CapEx by onstream date. Please be aware, that only larger projects, with a CapEx of about â¬10 million are shown here. For this year, we expect to bring projects onstream with a value of approximately â¬800 million. As you can see, a sizeable majority of our investments in the recent past and near future are focused on growth markets. We believe and continue to believe that these are the markets of the future that with stronger economic development, offer us the best prospects of top line growth and margin expansion, once local merchant contributions ramp up.
The chart on the right side gives a breakdown of our project opportunity. In the light of the challenging investment climate, brought about by reduced macroeconomic growth, and the development of the oil price, it is no surprise that the absolute volume has come down to around â¬3.4 billion. However, it is still on a very solid level. In this environment, customers are taking more time to make thorough investment decisions. Here too we see that going forward, growth markets still constitute the majority of opportunities.
In this context, the existing position in different regions in a local business model like ours is very important. On slide 14, you can see that these activities in every major economic region of the world, we have diversified global footprint.
Our market position is strong in a majority of these markets, as we are the market leader in about half of them, and a strong number two in another 21 countries. These leading positions are important in helping us achieve density in our business activities, be it in healthcare in the U.S., or in industrial gases in Asia Pacific.
The map on this page, gives you a sense of how we view our markets, and how we are positioned in them. Our strong market positions in many markets help us to generate both attractive and sustainable margin.
On the right side of the slide, you see our assumptions for the development of industrial production to be around 3% to 4% in the coming years. There have been no catalysts in the past few months, since our capital market day, that have caused us to revise these assumptions. As you know, industrial production is a good indicator for the expected growth in the merchant business.
Given the slow growth environment of the recent two years, we remain as always, rather cautious on our expectations. With our very strong position in the growth market, and given the investments under construction or in the ramp-up phase, we know that we are very well placed to capture the profitable growth in the faster growing markets.
Another important growth driver in our portfolio is our resilient healthcare business, which you see on slide 15. With over â¬3 billion in annual turnover, Linde is the leader in the respiratory healthcare market, serving 20,000 hospitals and 1.5 million individual homecare patients around the world. In 2014, we further grew our market share in the U.S. to now approximately 32%. Increasing our patient base, allows us to further demonstrate our cost leadership through economies of scale, purchasing power being an important aspect.
Due to our global presence in about 60 countries, we benefit from the know-how transfer from market-to-market. Growth prospects for this business are strongly driven by demographics. Today, the world's population includes around 400 million people aged 65 or over. By 2050, this age group will further increase by a billion people.
Additional market drivers are the still high share of untreated patients, and the increasing number of patients in the area of chronic respiratory diseases, like sleep apnoea and COPD. Patients do not only demand new and innovative pharmaceutical and medical gases, they are looking for holistic and comprehensive service offerings in hospitals, as well as at home. We meet these needs by constantly striving for innovation. Our LIV IQ healthcare cylinder is such an example. With these cylinders, oxygen usage in our hospitals can be remotely monitored, and this range of patient compliance can be ensured. At the same time, the filling level of the cylinder can be monitored, and the replacement cylinder can be supplied as required. Given the aforementioned drivers, we expect a stable growth profile in healthcare.
After outlining our value creation strategy, I would like to continue with the outlook on page 16. Recent economic forecasts indicate that a global economy will grow at a slightly faster pace in 2015 than in 2014. However, considering the geopolitical crises in some parts of the world, we continue to be rather cautious in our assumptions. In October, we have already indicated that in 2015 we will see a negative impact from shutdowns of customer facilities, like the end of our contract in Italy, and the upcoming closure of a refinery in Australia. This will also impact our comparable growth rate in the Gases division this year. As you are well aware, we do not adjust for such effects. These developments are definitely an exception rather than the rule.
On the other hand, we will see contribution from the start and ramp up of new capacities. In the recent years, we have experienced slow industrial production growth, this is the reason for a slower ramp-up of the merchant capacity. So the industrial production grows -- accelerate again, there is a clear upside.
The same applies for the price and volume growth of our existing business and the corresponding upside. Additionally, we are working to optimize our portfolio via asset swaps, also [indiscernible] on M&A, as well as with deactivations [ph] where it makes sense.
With our high order backlog, we expect the engineering division to record revenues at a similar level as achieved in 2014. Based on our conservative assumptions, and depending on economic trends and exchange rate development, we strive to achieve Group revenues in 2015 of â¬18.2 billion to â¬19 billion.
This brings me already to the outlook on slide 16. The guidance regarding Group revenues for 2015 was just outlined. Depending on economic trends and exchange rate developments, we anticipate to achieve in 2015, an increase in Group operating profit, with non-recurring items to a level between â¬4.1 billion to â¬4.3 billion.
In the same timeframe, we are seeking to achieve a return on capital employed of 9% to 10%, also depending on economic trends and exchange rate developments, we target to achieve in 2015 in the Gases division, revenues of â¬14.9 billion to â¬15.4 billion, and an operating profit between â¬4.05 billion and â¬4.25 billion.
We assume that the market environment in the Engineering business will be much more volatile than in previous years. Nevertheless, we are well positioned with a balanced product portfolio and high order backlog. Therefore, we plan to generate revenues in the Engineering division, between â¬3 billion and â¬3.3 billion, with an operating margin of around 8%, which is well in line with our mid-term guidance for Engineering.
We confirm our medium-term targets of Group operating profit of â¬4.5 billion to â¬4.7 billion, and the return on capital employed of 11% to 12% in 2017. Please note that these targets are based on exchange rates, prevailing from when the targets were communicated at the end of October.
I also reconfirm our HPO targets of cross-cost savings of â¬750 million to â¬900 million in the four years from 2013 to 2016. With â¬420 million delivered in the first half of the program, we are fully on track. Additionally, the organizational refinement I have outlined earlier, shall deliver around â¬100 million to â¬120 million savings by 2016. 
Before handing over to Georg, I'd like to conclude my part of today's presentation by outlining to you the strength of the Linde Group on the next page. We are well positioned, both in terms of technology, with our leading Engineering division, and geographically as a leader in both mature as well as growth markets, and in particular, our established clusters.
Thanks to our resilient business model, as well as our broad customer mix and range of end markets, we have a well balanced setup. Our prospects of profitable growth are rooted in demand drivers for our product, our investment pipeline, and the prevailing trends in healthcare. Additionally, our strengths in application is real competitive advantage for value generation. Both at our customers, and for our shareholders. By transforming into a learning organization, we strive to continuously improve our efficiency and productivity, as demonstrated by the earlier discussion in the context of our HPO program, where we are on track to deliver on our targeted cost savings.
Last but not least, we are also staying on track financially, with consistently increasing cash generation, a solid financial position, and a dividend policy that is geared towards continuity. These are the strengths that characterize Linde. We will continue to build on those, as we strive to generate value for our shareholders.
I will now hand over to Georg, for a detailed review of the operational and financial performance. Thank you very much.
Georg Denoke
Thank you, Wolfgang and good afternoon to everyone from my side. I would like to start off my part of today's presentation by reviewing the operational performance of the Gases and Engineering division in 2014, and then move on to our financial performance.
Starting with the Gases division on slide 20, reported revenues increased incrementally year-on-year to â¬13.982 billion. On a comparable basis, growth was 2.7%, though impact due to currency remains a headwind at minus 2.6% on a full year basis, it has significantly improved from the minus 4.2% we had on a nine months basis, resulting from the weakening euro. The revenue impact due to natural gas was negligible.
I will now move on to revenues by product area. Healthcare achieved 3.6% comparable growth in 2014. Recall, that growth in the first half of the year was still impacted by competitive bidding too in the U.S. homecare market. However, growth accelerated significantly in the second half of the year reaching 5.6%. On-site recorded comparable growth of 4.2% supported by planned startups and ramp-ups over the course of the year. However, on-site growth was negatively impacted by maintenance shutdowns, and end of contract in the fourth quarter. Bulk revenue increased by 3.5%, in contrast to strong comparable growth in Q4 in North America, U.K. and continental Europe, but development was weaker in Southern Hemisphere.
Concluding with cylinders, comparable growth in the product area amounted to minus 0.2% for the year. In the fourth quarter, cylinder demand in Western Europe remained soft, and the repeal of the carbon tax affected our cylinder business in Australia negatively. On the other hand, the cylinder business developed positively in the Americas.
We continue by taking a look at revenues by operating segment. Revenue in EMEA increased slightly by 0.1% on a comparable basis, supported by positive growth in U.K., Middle East and Eastern Europe, while demand in continental Europe and Africa remained soft. By product area, the highest contribution to growth was from bulk.
In Asia-Pac, comparable growth was 4.7%, driven by 9.7% comparable growth in Greater China by planned startup and ramp-ups. In contrast, the South Pacific region continues to be impacted by the repeal of the carbon tax, and by negative economic trends in Australia, which we are addressing with the restructuring measures that Wolfgang presented earlier.
Underlying growth was also strong in Americas, coming in at 4.6%, supported by solid growth in North America. Onerously, the continuing deterioration of the economic climate in South America has restrained growth there, most notably in Brazil. On a positive note, healthcare recorded healthy growth in both North and South America.
Proceeding now to the operating profit by operating segment on page 23. Reported operating profit in EMEA rose to â¬1.778 billion and a corresponding operating margin of 29.7%, primarily due to higher contributions from the U.K. and Middle East. Operating profit in Asia-Pac also increased year-on-year reaching â¬1.010 billion in 2014. Operating margin remained stable at 26.5% despite economic weakness in the South Pacific region.
As for the Americas, operating profit in this segment declined slightly to â¬1.047 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 24.3%. The decrease in operating margin was mainly due to higher natural gas prices in North America, and the aforementioned negative economic trends in South America.
Let's now look to the Engineering division performance; in 2014, our Engineering division achieved record revenues of â¬3.106 billion, an increase of 7.9% compared to the previous year, and it is the highest level since recording. The operating profit of â¬300 million was slightly below the prior year's level. The realized margin of 9.7%remains above the industry average. Both revenue and margin development are on target.
On a full year basis, order intake was â¬3.2 billion, the contract awarded in the third quarter by SIBUR LLC represents a major contribution to the high level of order intake. The contract covers one of the largest acetylene plants in the world, which is to be built in Western Siberia.
Order backlog increased year-on-year to â¬4.7 billion, an increase of 3.7% compared to the end of the previous year, and also a record high figure for the end of the fiscal year. This backlog provides a good position in a challenging investment climate.
After outlining the performance of our divisions, I would like to move on to the financial performance on slide 25. In 2014, we achieved a very high level of operating cash flow of â¬3.3 billion, which represents an increase of 5%. Cash flow was driven by strong working capital management, and an increase in advanced payments in the Engineering division. We thought that net debt was stable at â¬8.2 billion by the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA of 2.1 times remained at the same level of the previous year. Both figures were supported by the strong operating cash flow, but negatively affected by exchange rate movements, that increased the value of net debt in euro terms, on a spot rate basis end of the year.
S&P recently confirmed this rating assessment of A+ in December 2014; Moody's upgraded the ratings from A3 to A2 in June 2014, reflecting the continued improvement of our resilient business model. The rating outlook from both agencies is stable.
I will now move on to the ROCE development; return on capital employed for 2014 amounted to 9.5%, slightly below last year's figures of 97%. Please note that since capital employed is calculated, using FX spot rates at year end, the devaluation of the euro in the last month of 2014 resulted in an increase in capital employed compared to the prior year. In addition, assets under construction also increased, that's despite the numerator is virtually the same as in 2013. The increase of the denominator by approximately â¬500 million lowered the resulting figure for a return on capital employed by about 20 basis points.
Next I would like to discuss the Gases CapEx on page 27; CapEx spend in 2014 for the Gases division amounted to â¬1.9 billion, 16% below the level of 2013, and resulting in a CapEx sales ratio of 13.5%, compared to 16.1% in the prior year. Based on the execution of the existing project pipeline and expected spend for gases distribution equipment, the CapEx guidance for 2015 is around â¬2 billion, as a result, and as indicated in the graph, the CapEx sales ratio should further decline this year to around the mid-term range of 13%. Note that the CapEx guidance is of course also influenced by investment projects denominated in U.S. dollars.
Now I would like to move on, on the proposed dividend development. In the annual general meeting, in May, we will propose to our shareholders, an increase of our dividend for the fiscal year 2014 to â¬3.15 per share. This represents a payout ratio of 44.2%. As you know, we target to develop dividend roughly in line with the development of the operating profit. The proposed increase of 5% reflects the strong free cash flow development and our expectation of a continuing strong business performance.
This leads me to the final slide; going forward, we will continue to balance returns and future growth based on our solid financial position; that means to carefully allocate cash within the triangle.
As stated within our outlook, we target to grow revenues and operating profit. We will continue to invest in future profitable growth; as earlier guided the CapEx to sales ratio in our Gases division is expected to return to this year of around 30%, the mid-term average. Secondly, Linde's net debt to EBITDA ratio remains stable at 2.1 times, we absolutely want to maintain a strong investment grade rating, with the net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times maximum.
Last but not least, we are strongly committed to increase total shareholder value. Therefore, we will continue to apply a sustainable dividend policy, roughly in line with the development of operating profits.
Thank you for your attention and interest in Linde, and we are happy to take your questions now. Operator, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Rakesh Patel, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Rakesh Patel
Hi there, just a couple of questions if I can. First of all, if you could give us an update on asset swaps? It seems like you talked some length about it in your press conference this morning, but perhaps you can give us a bit more detail in terms of the talk which are ongoing, the scope, the size, anything that you can would be extremely helpful, just so we can get a lay of the land, if you like? 
And then secondly, perhaps Georg, maybe you can help us, just because my math isn't very good, could you translate the revenue and EBITDA that you achieved in 2014 at current spot rates roughly? And then finally, I am just trying to get a sense of the restructuring charges that you're booking into the P&L? At the Capital Markets day last year, you talked about continual restructuring as part of the day-to-day running of the business, I am just slightly wondering what makes these charges more exceptional to otherwise, and why they would be non-recurring? Thanks very much.
Wolfgang Buchele
So Rakesh, let me start, and it's Wolfgang speaking, regarding your first question, and then I would also give you some input regarding your third question before Georg talks on the figures.
Regarding asset swaps, we are in discussions and we have initiated discussions with interested parties. However, we are not at a point that a decision is imminent, and I think we guided from the very beginning that this is nothing, which will be implemented within a couple of weeks. And from that point of view, I would just ask for your patience. There is interest with some of our peers, but not yet at a point that any speculation would justify.
Regarding the restructuring, I think we guided very clearly already last year, that we wanted to take â¬50 million in the fourth quarter, and we also said that some restructuring charges should be expected in the first half of this year, which has to do on the one hand, with realigning our organization in Australia, Brazil and South Africa to the new [flight] [ph] level, but also being linked to the sharpening, to the streamlining of our organization overall, in line with a new operating model, and that's why we consider these charges extraordinary or exceptional, and therefore non-recurring, because we are not streamlining our organizational and operational model every year. So from that point of view, this is directly linked to these, and as I said before, we want to have all the charges booked in the first half of this year, and that's why you see us -- we have pointed out another â¬90 million to be expected to take place. Literally, most of the matters have been identified by now, and we are now in the discussion with the respective works councils, with the respective labor representatives for the details of the implementation.
And with this I would hand over to Georg, and ask him to talk about revenue and EBITDA, which I could give just a very short answer.
Georg Denoke
Yes Rakesh, I think my mathematical skill-set is less developed than yours of course. But to try to give you an indication of this discussion of course itâs a huge temptation to apply these spot rates to the model today, and only isolate them from challenging macroeconomic environment. I think therefore we have to take that with caution. I would like to answer your questions the following, I see let's say, roughly around â¬100 million upside through the guidance we have given you today of â¬4.1 billion to â¬4.3 billion based on the currency development. And of course, you can be more aggressive on your assumption of the U.S. dollar, taking parity or more aggressive sales. I want to point out itâs not only the U.S. dollar, but of course it is the U.S. dollar, especially in light of the Lincare acquisition.
I think we had the Lincare acquisition in 2012, and we were going through 2013 and 2014, rather with weak U.S. dollar exchange rate, 1.37/1.33 last year. So that is now the first time where the impact of Lincare with its dollar contribution will really come through, but we also have pound as an upside and we would have some [Austral dollar] [ph] and other currencies. So it is a mix effect, and the isolated thing I think you can say from today's perspective, there is â¬100 million upside isolated on the OP guidance and range. Thank you.
Rakesh Patel
That's perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Martin RÃ¶diger, Kepler Cheuvreux. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Martin RÃ¶diger
Thank you. Just to follow-up on Rakesh's question. On the guidance, you mentioned this â¬100 million potential upside on the EBITDA guidance. Which currency effects -- for example, for the dollar, you use for the low end and the high end of the EBITDA guidance range. Is that basically have stable currencies in your guidance? 
Second question is on the -- on slide 13, while you explain, you have now â¬3.4 billion in opportunities, obviously down from the â¬3.8 billion mentioned at the Capital Markets day, but why did you change the timeframe? Previously, the timeframe was for 12 months, now it is for 18 months? 
And the third question is on the HPO-2 program; you have achieved â¬420 million in the last two years. But at your Capital Markets day, it was â¬400 million, so that means you have achieved â¬20 million savings in Q4. Is the momentum of the savings from HPO slowing, and why is that the case, maybe you can also clarify, what is now the timeline, because on slide 9 you mentioned itâs timeline until 2016, and on slide 17 the timeline is until 2017? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Yeah. Thanks for your questions. I think, starting this project pipeline, I think it is recommendable we did that from time to time also in the past, when you have certain significant impacts like financial crisis, now like the oil prices, you should anticipate in your pipeline that expected decision days for customers, for final investment approval are shifted through that environment, and you should not [cut] [ph] only the impact of today. So from that perspective I think itâs wise to extend that timeline a little bit. Itâs not a material difference honestly, itâs only that you say, look, some of that is shifted and you should not see this as a [cut] [ph], but some others are seeing as a [cut] [ph], because you assume that this is not happening in the next 18 years. So that is the reason we did the same in the financial crisis, oil price development can be one reason in that dimension, so that is the answer to your question number one.
Number two, I think I am hesitating to give you the range exactly, upper side end of the bandwidth and lower end because it is not isolated. We have put mix in our model, and one is related to industrial production, and why I meant the experience of the past that we are starting into the year, people are positive, and in the end, we have lower growth rates from the expectation of the start of the year, and the other is now the temptation is too aggressive to be carried away, and you see what a difference of two weeks or four weeks are to be applied in an FX model. So that is, I think too much, because I do not want to talk that isolated, because that gives the wrong risk and chances profile.
On HPO, your third question, I think we have seen what we expected and told you in the third quarter, when we had the Capital Markets day, that we see a softer landing in Q4. It has zero to do with the plan of another year; another year will also run, but we have communicated these four year's time frame in HPO, and as Wolfgang pointed out in his presentation. Thank you.

The next question comes from Neil Tyler, Redburn. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Neil Tyler
Good afternoon. Thank you. Couple of questions please; think about the guidance -- operating profit guidance, in terms of bridging from 2014. If I look at the sales and operating profit growth that you achieved in 2014, in the Gases division specifically, sales were basically flat, profit was down a bit. But then within that profit numbers, I understand that there are some disposal gains, and I think judging by the cash flow, that's â¬77 million in the full year, so about â¬25 million in the fourth quarter, as well as some compensation payments in the European healthcare business. So can you help me bridge the 2015 guidance, which seems to imply on an underlying basis, double digit operating profit growth, if I take those numbers out of the base. Is that the right thing to do, that's the first question?
Secondly, sorry to come back to currencies, but just within your very helpful bridge on currency effects, -- by currency, the others bucket, can you just give me an idea of what I should be watching most intently, as regards that bucket? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So thank you Neil for your questions. I think it is very important again to discuss these. First of all, I think the charges on -- or the chances of the AP payment, that was a cash flow related issue, so nothing which is affecting a one-time operating profit contribution for the last year in 2014. So it was purely cash flow related, and therefore, no OP relation.
The second part I think is related to what you saw in the cash flow statement, which is â¬77 million for disposals of non-recurring assets compared to last year, â¬35 million, we consider that basket rather as normal operational development. We discussed that in one-on-ones and also I think in the call that we have a very developed business in mature markets, and sometimes also in the emerging markets where you start within a city area of today, and therefore you move out of the city, and start your new filling plant in a different location, which is not impacting homes for people. That is mainly the point, so you have that in many of the countries, I wouldn't consider that as an unique item, also besides other things. And I wouldn't isolate my line, but I consider really that level as a normal level.
Then your question related to the bridge of the revenues; I think here --
Neil Tyler
I think itâs more about the currency slide that you have, and you have the basket of others, just really within that basket, what are the greatest influences?
Georg Denoke
I think the greatest difference as I said will be -- the U.S. dollar change is a very significant change. Last year, the rate was 1.33 roughly, and then followed I think by Pound and then others. So from that I mentioned, I would consider that as the most significant change, besides others.
Neil Tyler
It was the others I was interested in, I am just trying to get to the bottom of, if there is any one or two specific currencies that influence that more than a great big long list?
Georg Denoke
Yeah. This is what I said, it is U.S. dollar I think and Pound, which are impacting that more pronounced, let's say it that way. That's it.
Neil Tyler
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Clark, Societe Generale. Your line is now open.
Peter Clark
Yes I have a few questions actually, the first one is on the on-site business. Is that something you think you can grow this year given the shutdowns; because I mean looking at the bridge again, I mean, and given what you've told us, it feels like itâs probably 1% to 2% drag on the Gases line, and obviously a lot more on on-site. So I am just wondering about the Australian shutdown and obviously with the Italian one already. 
And then the second question is related just to the general comments, obviously you are doing a lot of work with the organization, investment focus, cost cutting, a lot of it focused on Gases, but obviously you guide for the engineering margin to perhaps normalize; just wondering your feel for the Group EBITDA margin, when you look out to 2017. I have to presume with the work you are doing, you're confident you can get growth in the Group EBITDA margin. Thank you.
Georg Denoke
Thanks Peter. I think starting with the on-site and tonnage related question, I think especially for the first half of the year, it will be a significant challenge for us, when I look into contribution for new staffs, and the ramp-up contribution that we show a strong development, or even positive development in tonnage, when we look isolated; because we have in the first part of the year, the hit in the two big contracts, one [indiscernible], so that is a challenge to show here, and a comparable growth rate which is positive. Secondly, I think you have the effect out of -- also a little bit of electrical energy, and we adjust for natural gas, as you know, but we don't adjust for electrical energy, that also is not, from a top line visibility perspective, helping us.
By net of cost, you also get the answer, that there are also some reporting effects in the Gases margin, related to, for example, lower electrical energy prices, lower natural gas prices, that all of course helps the margin, and then I head over for the more operational part, to working regarding the organizational refinement.
Wolfgang Buchele
So obviously, as we have said, we take certain restructuring charges, and obviously, as a consequence of the restructuring charges, we are expecting savings from that measures, and obviously these savings are coming net on top of HPO. So we are not changing now the HPO figures, and we will see the first impact, most likely in the second half of 2015, and we will see the full impact of approximately â¬100 million to â¬120 million in net savings, by the end of 2016, depends a little bit, how quickly we are able to implement.
Now obviously, that is on one hand, clearly helping us to improve the margin, on the other hand we also have cost increases, you have inflation all across the place, and that's why I would expect in the Gases side, there is room for slight improvement. On the other hand, please also bear in mind, that the engineering margin is coming down, because clearly you see here, more challenging times ahead of us, and that's why from an overall margin, there is clearly-clearly a challenge, so from that point of view, you should not expect too much in increase of the Group margin.
What I also would like to emphasize is, that the business for the time being remains challenging. First of all in Australia, that is still an ongoing de-industrialization, and we are working against that, as you know. We also see that cylinder business in South Africa is very challenging, and from that point of view, that's also something which has an impact. So therefore, we are striving to keep the margin at the existing level, perhaps a slight improvement, but in 2015, you should not expect immediately to improve.
Peter Clark
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from John Klein, Berenberg. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
John Klein
Yeah hi there, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got two of them; first one, on the U.S. margins in the fourth quarter, which looked pretty decent. Can you give us a bit of a feel, how much of that is actually attributable to further cost savings at Lincare, or market share gains at Lincare? Maybe just untangle that a bit? And related to that on Lincare, we had a management change at Lincare, any new strategic elements coming with that into Lincare?
And then second question on pricing in cylinder in the fourth quarter; -- Q4, slightly negative pricing in Europe in cylinder, could you elaborate a bit on how useful pricing in cylinder, particularly in Europe in the fourth quarter of the year? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So I think when we look into the development of the cylinder business, I think the very big difference for us in the footprint of the mix of the cylinder business is really Australia. I think here, we have a high market share, and we are leading in a market, which is on the manufacturing side, really not developing positive. So the Group has seen here, the first time a slightly positive development in pricing, but volume wise, itâs still a very challenging environment from that I mentioned. So I think we have still a positive pricing effect overall, as we have seen a volume glitch in the fourth quarter, still in Australia, mainly. So that is I think for us, the bigger impact comparing that with [indiscernible] on the European sites. Overall, Europe was -- still soft, let's say site work, and we have the positive contribution, especially out of markets in Eastern Europe, certain markets have developed more positively. I think this is something which we could, to point out here in comparison.
And then the margin development in the North American business, I think we have two effects, one is out of Lincare, so that is also the -- what we discussed, the volume effect after competitive bidding too, where we have seen more consolidation overall; and that is positive and then we have to be careful, out of the weaker starting point, and the South American perspective, we have seen some improvement in Q4, which has been bringing back to these high levels.
Wolfgang Buchele
Regarding the management change, first of all, I also would like to take the opportunity here to thank again John Byrnes who did a great job in developing Lincare to what it is today. You might recall, that I said from my pharmaceutical experience, I would try to see Lincare moving closer when it comes to pricing negotiation with the payers, to a scheme which is today more of the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, where you negotiate with your payer, rather than you're constantly being involved in bidding, and that's why I am very pleased that [indiscernible] were able to attract a very skilled, very experienced senior executive from the pharmaceutical industry to head our Lincrae division going forward, and from that point I am sure that she is able to continue successful growth path of that part of our business, which has developed extremely nicely over recent years, and I am expecting that this is continuing also in the years to come, even when the situation is challenging occasionally from a better perspective, on the payer side, but I am sure that with new approaches, we are in a situation where can also successfully manage that.
John Klein
That's great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Benson, Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Benson
Thanks very much. Can you just demonstrate -- or tell us what you're seeing in the Engineering business, and why you think margins will fall this year? If current rates apply to year-end net debt, what sort of number would we get? Can you perhaps -- materialize the scale of the contract terminations, as well it looks like this is a significant impact there. From the presentation, sorry there are a number of questions here, it doesn't look like there is much of a refinancing opportunity for a few years, but I was just wondering what you can do there, in terms of getting your finance costs down? And then just also quick on the tax rate we should expect for this year and the medium term? Thanks.
Wolfgang Buchele
Let me start off with Engineering; obviously, depending on the product mix, there is an impact on the margin, and we have currently still more large projects, than smaller projects under execution, and in general on the large projects, the margin is lower, and in the past, we were also in a sense, positively influenced, because in projects of the Engineering nature, you always have contingency put in place, and as we were successful in flawlessly implementing projects in the period 2011-2012 and to a certain extent, also 2013, we had some of the contingency not being used, which then ultimately resulted in an increase in profit.
And if you recall what we have guided, then we are with the 8%, which we assume for 2015. We are in the range, what we said, as a long term target for engineering, which is still substantially above what our peer group typically delivers. I hope that gives you some insights.
Andrew Benson
Yes, thanks.
Georg Denoke
So Andrew on the financing side, I think from a net debt perspective, itâs very difficult to forecast, also because of a big development and the estimation of year-end spot rates. So the upside on OP is here a certain downside, because we know -- you know that we have a basket of currencies, and we also relate to U.S. dollar cash flows, U.S. dollar debt, and therefore let's assume that the net debt level is relatively same level as it is today, not to be too aggressive at that current stage, but overall I think people are expecting more in currencies, and on the other hand then, you have an influence on that dimension, with a slight upside to reduce that as we normally do, but at that current stage, I would rather be more conservative.
The financing costs, you're pointing out the right thing here. There are not big obligations this year, to be refinanced that comes than the year after. At the current stage, we are below the 4% level of the debt interest rate level, so we are participating in that, also still on a floating side, but we have of course moved into a certain fixed grade already, so the upside comes really after 2015.
And then on the tax rate, I consider that level of 24% to 25%. Thank you.
Andrew Benson
Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Walsh, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Paul Walsh
Thanks very much. Afternoon everyone. Just three quick questions for me. I am sorry to come back to the topic of currency, but I just wondered if you could just be more direct in terms of what assumptions you're using around currency for the â¬4.1 billion to â¬4.3 billion EBITDA guidance, because the â¬100 million upside. What would you need to see that, what's that based on current spot? But just real numbers around your currency guidance would be helpful.
Secondly, as far as growth is concerned, within your sales target, what Gases' organic growth number have you baked in for 2015 please? And then just final question, sorry it has been a theoretical debate, but obviously stock prices are moving higher, discount rates are lower. How do you guys actually think about your hurdle rates for new business, the kind of cost of capital calculations you're running in the real world. What does the current environment mean? Does it change, or is it unchanged on the basis you're investing in projects for 30-40 years. Just curious to know what the real world impact of the current rate environment is on your business? Thank you.
Georg Denoke
So I think the assumption as I said earlier related to FX was here on current spot grades, some of what people anticipate that the dollar is not weakening, it is getting rather a little bit stronger, so that is I think the right assumption, there will be additional upside if you walk about the low parity from a dollar perspective of course.
On hurdle rates, I hand over to Wolfgang?
Wolfgang Buchele
Let me quickly come to the hurdle rates. We have now opportunity in project development as an organization in place. That organization is overlooking all our investment projects from the idea to the implementation. We don't see, due to the long term nature of our investments, any need to lower the hurdle rate or change the hurdle rate. We keep them as they have been in place. What we are doing is, we are challenging the business case, especially under the current circumstances, we are challenging the ramp-up rates much more intense; because you might recall, we've typically guided that ramp-up rates take three plus years. Under the current market environment, I would rather see them at four plus years. So we are challenging these factors, rather than amending hurdle rates. And the back [ph] and everything is currently very attractive, but that will definitely change over an 18 years period, what we normally cover with an investment, and that's why we stay tuned in this respect.
Paul Walsh
Understood. And just on Gases' organic growth, what's the assumption baked into the revenue guidance that you've given today?
Georg Denoke
I think this is a challenging question, especially against one or the other assumption on the IP related part, I think we have been much aggressive at that current stage with that guidance I think. I think we will see a very good development in the healthcare environment. I think something like 5% or also certain periods above that level. And I think with the end of the contract, as I pointed out, tonnage will be a challenging environment, and then I am hesitating, and therefore we have that range.
On the IP related growth, the upsides and downsides, is unclear as say, we are in October. Even if people are I think from a sentimental perspective more positive. We are a late cycle business as you know, and we will see that hopefully in the months to come, or months to come, but at that current stage. I think we have been rather conservative.
Paul Walsh
Okay, that's great. And I am just going to give it one more shot; the EBITDA guidance â¬4.1 billion to â¬4.3 billion, what's the euro-dollar exchange rate implied in that guidance?
Georg Denoke
As I pointed out earlier, I think the original assumption was around 1.15, as we pointed out. Of course, that's history, and therefore I pointed out what additional contribution is to be expected, when you apply the current spot rates.
Paul Walsh
That's super helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Markus Meyer, Baader. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Markus Meyer
Yeah, good afternoon gentlemen. Three questions. Any update on the assets under construction on the balance sheet, what is the number here and the development from Q3? Then secondly, there was a quite some organic growth that you baked in for the full year guidance. What does gas price [indiscernible] assumption you bake in for the full year guidance? And then lastly, there was another thing that took that up from the press conference, which was a discussion on the Gist business, is this now core, non-core, you can update on this business?
Wolfgang Buchele
Let me quickly start with just -- as we said already this morning. This morning we pointed out in the press conference itâs non-core, and nothing has changed since 11 o'clock this morning.
Georg Denoke
Related to the assets under construction, as you pointed out, this is a level of around â¬2 billion at the current stage which we have year end. The further increase as against last year as you know, and we will see a decrease this year. I mean, the first time that should happen because of bigger projects coming onstream, like the SEDARA project for example should come onstream. So from that dimension, I am hesitating a little bit here to give you a concrete number, also because of the currency development, out of that. I mean, we have a stronger activity also in the North American plant, but it can be around up to I think â¬400 million or so. So gas price assumption for us a pass-through, overall, we assume that gas price is a lower price level than in the last year, and we have that balancing off, given lower prices in the U.S. compared to the Asian market, we assume that this remains, but on a slightly lower level.
Markus Meyer
Is it then 1% track on your top line, the gas price, for revenue guidance of 2015?
Georg Denoke
I think itâs difficult to forecast, but itâs not a totally wrong number. I think itâs probably around 1% a little bit more.
Markus Meyer
Okay. Thanks.
Wolfgang Buchele
And let me just add on the Gist question. Obviously non-core, what does that mean? Gist is a very experienced logistics company, and from that point of view, we have benefited from the skills of Gist, but the nature of their business is not strategic for Linde, and from that point of view, you should not be surprised, if mid-term Gist might disappear from the portfolio of the company.
Markus Meyer
Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Thomas Gilbert, UBS. Your line is now open. Please, go ahead.
Thomas Gilbert
Good afternoon. Three questions, I hope you can hear me. Just one -- the last one is going to be on page 131 of the annual report, if you could have that ready, that would be helpful. The first question is on take or pay levels; in the performance of the second half 2014, as well as the guidance for EBITDA, do you see any change in contracts or the -- so that the average or the bulk of contracts running, above or below, take okay. Is there any benefits to the margin or dilutions or is it around about a stable level across the portfolio of contracts, current and future business developments?
The second one is on the order backlog of the Engineering business; can you split the backlog between -- roughly between captive and third party, and in conjunction, guide for the elimination or reconciliation line for 2015? And then finally to that page 131, which is the safety and environmental protection record. I am starting to understand how electricity consumption in your air separation units can be up 14% odd in the year, while Gases' goal is 2.7 -- is that -- I mean, I can understand where the transport costs are because of the cold winter in the U.S., beginning of the year. Can you just -- maybe even or after the call, try and reconcile intellectually, how the electricity consumption can be up 15% in 2014, I don't understand?
Wolfgang Buchele
Well we are looking into that at the current stage. I think from a order backlog perspective, I think that is a first number which we are searching really what is in the -- you're talking 2015, is this right?
Thomas Gilbert
Order backlog, I am just trying to -- I mean, I am talking about the Engineering business and the split between what you think -- [indiscernible] versus third parties and the elimination line revenue?
Wolfgang Buchele
Elimination 2015; so overall --
Thomas Gilbert
How about the guidance for this line item would be helpful for 2015?
Wolfgang Buchele
So order backlog, the overall number is mainly third party here. I think we are coming more and more onstream business, As you know, our order backlog number is a number not order enhanced, where you do not have the effect of percentage of completion. Our number is after percentage of completion revenue number, I think this is very important. So all what we have recognized as revenues already, is not included in these order backlogs, itâs really the future revenue number, which I here show. And I think the significant part, I haven't got a number now, but a significant part is â¬4 billion plus is third party, I think this is what I would expect is the number. We would come back to you if we would have a totally different number. But that is of course, at that stage, which I assumed.
Thomas Gilbert
So does that mean the reconciliation EBITDA will be less negative, because there is less profit transfer in between the divisions in 2015?
Wolfgang Buchele
Yes, that is absolutely then the assumption. Yeah.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from --
Wolfgang Buchele
So the page 131, so you are looking into the second line, right? Electricity consumption of air separation plants, in megawatt, from 20.7 to 23.5. I think I have not given the answer, only that we have also taken some new projects onstream I think, that is what I can tell you. Itâs megawatt, itâs not costs in that direction. So we have taken onstream certain capacity at that stage, but I don't have a simple answer to you, I have to tell you.
Thomas Gilbert
And then on the take or pay sort of situation across the portfolio, has that impacted the margins?
Wolfgang Buchele
No change compared to our last update.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. So stable development. Nothing significantly underwater incrementally?
Wolfgang Buchele
No.
Thomas Gilbert
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Mackey, Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Peter Mackey
Good afternoon everybody. I have got three questions I think. First, just coming back to Andrew Benjamin's question, I don't think you quite answered the quantification of the contract termination effect, and I just wanted to go back to -- I think the guidance you were suggesting at the nine month stage, I think you were suggesting you'd achieve about 5% growth in tonnage. If I obviously presumed you had an indication of these contract terminations coming up. So I wonder if you can just give us a little bit of color, if there was something else in the tonnage business that was a bit disappointing in the fourth quarter please?
The second question on the projects coming onstream, and in particular SEDARA, obviously started as a significant part of the â¬800 million of CapEx projects this year. Are you expecting any commercial impact from that, or is that more likely to be some revenues and EBIT really not until 2016 please? And final question, and this really is dusting off the old BOC question bank, but if I remember rightly, there was always an issue with the potential disposal of Gist around contract with Marks and Spencer, and I really can't remember, [indiscernible], if that ever changed. So there was a change in control clause, I believe, but that does date back a good decade or so, I don't know if there was any odd effect like that still in place at Gist, that might effect the EBITDA to a third party. Thanks very much.
Georg Denoke
I think we don't discuss any details on our conference with customers, and from that point of view, what we want to do is, we want to seek an adequate price, should we dispose, and from that point of view, once the right buyer comes across, then the asset is open. But we are not in a desperate need to dispose it off, because itâs performing extremely well, and itâs creating especially for Marks and Spencer, a very positive value, and itâs also supporting other companies increasingly, with consultancy services, so from that point of view, are not in desperate need to dispose Gist, and we are waiting for the right opportunity.
Wolfgang Buchele
So on the tonnage development I think, from an overall perspective, I think we did not communicate the 5% number because we haven't given a number of the shutdown of the contracts at the Capital Market day. The triple digit number, plus to give you an indication. So we are not talking here a small number. What we have seen as an development of course, is the decline in the natural gas prices and energy prices. I think this is, from a top line perspective, when we do comparable -- then we of course adjust for the natural gas price, but we do not adjust for the electrical energy price, what I pointed out earlier. So from this I mentioned, I think this is something which will eat into top line visibility I think. That's a point we definitely expect contributions from SEDARA within 2015, and not in 2016 only. That is not the case.
Peter Mackey
Okay, thank you. And just pardon me for asking, but I am sure I misunderstood this at all, but I always thought that you did include electricity pass-throughs and the thing; has that ever changed or was I just mistaken?
Georg Denoke
No, no. I mean, we have in the contracts, electricity pass-throughs, that is 100% clear, and that is in all contract. But when we communicated ever comparable growth, we never adjusted for electricity.
Peter Mackey
Right okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from Bernd Tomlin [ph] from MainFirst. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. Just one question left rally. What's currently [indiscernible], how do you see demand, and then also interest in new projects developing in China? Thank you.
Wolfgang Buchele
I think let me take that. China as such, remains for us a very interesting market, and we are in a number of negotiations. However, you might have realized that there is a shift of power from the regions back to Beijing. NDRC takes a much stronger stand in the decision making process, and that's why also their decisions are held back and it takes a longer time, till especially new projects are decided, but we are expecting that we still see projects coming, because we are in a various number of customer indirections at an advanced stage. But in general, itâs again also due to the political shift later than what we originally saw.
In general, the market is interesting, and we are continuing to ramp up our capacity, which we have already in place, and we are doing this very successfully.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, excellent. Thank you.
Wolfgang Buchele
If there are no further questions, I can confirm to Thomas Gilbert and the audience that the number is right from a third party or a backlog perspective, we see â¬4.1 billion. So that's confirmed, and I thank you for the lively discussion and looking forward to our further communication, when we have the first quarter numbers on 30th of April. Thank you very much, have a good day. Bye-bye.
Georg Denoke
Thank you also from my side. Bye-bye.
