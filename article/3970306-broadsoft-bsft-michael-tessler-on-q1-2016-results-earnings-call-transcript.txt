Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the BroadSoft Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Chris Martin. You may begin.
Chris Martin - Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss BroadSoft's results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of the BroadSoft website at www.broadsoft.com. With me on today's call are; Michael Tessler, BroadSoft's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Tholen, BroadSoft's Chief Financial Officer.

Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking the time to discuss our first quarter 2016 results. I'm happy with our Q1 performance as we delivered against both our business plan and our strategic priority. Financially, we grew revenue in the first quarter by 31%, earnings by greater than 50% and we delivered strong operating cash flow as well. Jim will go through our financial results in more detail as usual later in our prepared remarks.
Regarding our execution on our strategy, one of the quarter's notable highlights was Vodafone Germany's launch of its BroadSoft-based One Net service offering. Vodafone is the second largest mobile carrier in Germany. Its new One Net business solution is an innovative offering targeting the 10 to 250 user segment with a truly converged fixed and mobile integrated service. It's the first communication service in Germany where users can have single phone number and voicemail box that works across both their mobile and desk phone.
We were delighted that Vodafone selected our UC-One solution to power its important service. Critical to our selection was our ability to deliver an IMS-based mobile solution that supports all devices including 2G and 3G phones. Also important was their confidence in our ability to execute. This is a large and complex project implement and the on-time delivery is a testament to the hard work put in by the project team.
We're also excited that Vodafone Germany has put significant effort into promoting this service. They launched One Net in late February at CeBIT which is one of the world's largest tech industry trade shows and so it received a lot of attention, especially from the local tech and business press. Importantly, BroadSoft was also a key participant in the launch marketing.
For example, we were in a booth at the show, and held a joint product demo of One Net solution which led to extremely positive reaction. Customers were impressed by how simple and seamless it was to move their communications across desktop to mobile handset to PC. We also collaboratively demoed our UC-One Hub product and held a number have joint analyst and press briefing. These types of co-marketing activities are the first step of the broader co-branding effort we've talked about last quarter as part of our goal to expand our yield and grow our sell-through. This provides a great segue into our strategic priorities update.
As you recall last quarter, we outlined four separate strategic priorities; continued innovation, expanding our broad product footprint, adding new markets, as well as previously mentioned improving yield of our markets and channels. These priorities are important in order for us to maintain and extend our leadership position in the market as well as drive long-term growth. As I mentioned last quarter, our goal is to provide updates to these priorities each quarter as appropriate. I'd like to spend some time on that now.
On continued innovation, let me start providing an update on BroadSoft Design. It's been less than a year since the group's inception. In that short time, we've launched engagements with large tier 1 service providers and continue to grow the pipeline. Many service providers then embarked on digital transformation initiatives to simplify their often manual customer-facing processes.
With our design capabilities, we become an important enabler of these initiatives for their UC services. As an example, we are working with one large North American customer to re-imagine their end-to-end customer journey from buying to administering their UC solution into a simple, frictionless and completely online process. It's also worth noting that our broader innovation in the Unified Communications space continues to be recognized by independent third parties. During the quarter, BroadCloud UC-One was selected as the recipient of TMC's 2016 Unified Communications Product of the Year.
Regarding expanding our BroadCloud footprint, as we've said in the past we plan on selectively adding additional geographies in response to customer demand. I'm excited to announce that we are extending our BroadCloud servicing to France. We've signed with one of the largest PBX resellers in the country as our anchored tenant customer, which demonstrates a couple of important points.
First, the decline of the PBX market continues and those that are in distribution chain are looking for new strategies to offset the decline. Second, we're adding non-traditional service providers to our mix of customers, which BroadCloud enables us to do.
I also wanted to provide an update on Japan which, most of you already know, is a new BroadCloud country as of last November. One of the drivers for pushing into Japan is that we saw growing SMB demand for Cloud Unified Communication in a huge untapped market. With BroadCloud, we believe we are the first to market with a true service provider cloud solution, and so we are very excited that NIFTY, a leading Japanese business ISP, selected BroadCloud and UC-One for their new ShaMo! service. This service targets highly mobile and entrepreneurial small and medium-sized businesses that need to develop and deploy communication services extremely quickly. Our hosted UC solutions are perfect for this type of use case.
On adding new markets and channels and also increasing the breadth of solutions available to them, hopefully you've all seen the announcement where Digicel is going to offer a new range of our cloud and IP-based communication services. As many of you already know, Digicel is a multinational mobile carrier with properties across Caribbean, Central America and Asia Pacific. By leveraging our UC-One platform, they are now able to provide their customers with complete solutions starting with fixed-mobile substitution, fixed-mobile convergence and Unified Communications that target both SMBs and large corporations. Digicel has been a terrific distribution partner for us and is a great example of how we are expanding across their footprint.
On increasing our sell-through, we had a great Q1 that represented our highest level of sell-through for our hosted UC product. While all geographies showed healthy results, strength in North America was the key driver of this record performance. New service launches like Vodafone's One Net should help drive further growth in future quarters.
Before I close out, I would like to welcome aboard Jane Dietze and Eva Sage-Gavin, our newest members of our board or directors. Jane is the managing director of Brown University's Investment Office with significant financial and investment experience. While Eva is the Vice Chairman of Aspen Institute's Skills for America's Future and brings an extremely deep level of human capital expertise. We're extremely pleased that both of them have joined the BroadSoft team. Their expertise strengthens our board's breadth of talent and their insight will be extremely valuable as we continue to grow the BroadSoft business around the world.
As you can see, we had extremely busy and activity-filled Q1 and our strong results are a testament to the hard work of the entire BroadSoft team. I want to take a moment to thank them for the continued and invaluable contribution to our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. We had a great start to the year with total revenue in the first quarter of $73 million, up 31% from the year-ago period. This marked our seventh consecutive quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Our strong revenue performance in the quarter which was driven by double-digit growth in all geographic regions combined with lower than expected expenses led to non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 per share which represented 54% year-over-year growth.
Software revenue of $31 million was up 35% over last year's Q1. Subscription and maintenance support revenue was $33 million, up 30% year-over-year. Of this amount, SaaS revenue was $12 million as compared to $8.7 million last quarter and $8.5 million in last year's Q1. As a reminder, the larger than typical sequential uptick was due to the inclusion of nearly two months of Transera revenue and a true-up amount from the resolution of a customer contract issue. For Q2, we expect SaaS revenue to be in the high-$12s million to $13 million.
Professional services and other revenue of $9 million was up 25% year-over-year driven by our network transformation project. Total billings were $65 million, up 17% while software billings were down relative to Q1 of last year. Billings were actually pretty aligned with our internal expectation, pipelines continue to look strong, and as Mike mentioned, we continue to see strong sell-through from our service provider customers.
Now, onto margins and expenses. In Q1, we had gross margin of 76% which was flat with the year-ago quarter. Software margin was 96%, up from 91% a year ago period driven by revenue growth. Subscription and support margin was 73%, up from 71% last year. This improvement was driven by increases in both maintenance and SaaS margins.
Professional services' margin was 21%, down from the mid-40%s in the year-ago period. For Q2, we expect overall cost of sales to increase by approximately $2 million to $2.5 million. The increase is largely due to a full quarter's worth of Transera expenses and additional expenses related to investment in our cloud business.
Operating margin increased to 16% versus 14% a year ago. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $44 million. While we relied on expenses relative to our expectations, we do expect to largely catch up on this investment spend through the rest of the year. Our expectation for Q2 is that OpEx will increase by approximately $4.5 million from Q1.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash flow from operations was a very strong $19 million, driven by receipts from our great Q4 of last year. Net cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $345 million at the end of March. Account receivables were $93 million at the end of March, down sequentially as is typical for Q1. Deferred revenue declined sequentially by $8 million to $103 million, roughly in line with normal Q1 seasonal trends.
Now on to guidance. As you may have seen in our earnings press release, we expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $76 million to $81 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.40. For the year, our annual guidance remains for revenue to be in the range of $332 million to $340 million and full year EPS to be in the range of $1.90 to $2.10. I wanted to provide a little more color on our annual guide on revenue. We're tracking to plan as I noted last quarter. We expect 2016 to be a relatively back-end loaded year, as is typical for us, and our view remains unchanged.
On EPS, as I mentioned earlier, we wanted to maintain the budget dexterity to continue to invest in our business and its long-term growth potential. We feel very good about the overall tone and tenor of our business and our guiding to continued revenue momentum for Q2 and the rest of the year.
Just a modeling note. At our closing share price as of last Friday, we are above the conversion price of one of our coverts, and very close on the other coverts. We expect both offerings to be net settled, so there's limited dilution even above these conversion prices.
If our stock were to average $40 for the quarter, we would see about 0.5% in our fully diluted share count used for non-GAAP earnings. At $45, we would see about a 2.8% increase in diluted share count.
So to summarize, we had a great start to 2016 and believe we are tracking well to our expectations and guidance for the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks, Jim. Jim and I are now happy to answer any questions. Operator, would you please open the call?
Question-and-Answer Session

Our first question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Hi, there. Thanks very much, guys. All right, I wanted to kind of start out by asking about license billings. And you had some comments, I think, in the monologue about it, but I think the number is down 6% year-on-year. Can you kind of walk us through again kind of what's driving that? Is that seasonality? And it sounded like your billings were pretty consistent relative to your expectations on the license side, but kind of walk us through that year-on-year comparison and what's driving that. Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Hey, George. So a few thoughts. Look, the software business can tend to lumpiness. It's just the first quarter. I think last first quarter was a little unusual where we actually had billings in excess of revenue. I think the business, George, the business looks good. We've been a pretty consistent billings grower on a year-over-year basis. It's been in the 20% ZIP Code. Quarter came in at 17%. Pipeline looks good. Sell-through looks goods. We reaffirmed guidance. So I think it's seasonality and quarter lumpiness.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Great. Okay. And then, I wanted to ask also about some of the Project Tempo initiatives coming out in the last quarter. Can you walk us through kind of where you are right now in terms of delivery of those pieces of the solution? And then, can you remind us how you guys are pricing that? And I guess, I'm really curious about if you can get a lift in ASPs and per seat license pricing as you layer in those features. Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
George, I'll take it. It's Mike. Yeah I think, right now, what we're doing is we're in the process of rolling out a select set of betas with customers and we've selected different customers into different geographies to work with us on the hub project or hub beta. And an important part of the beta process is to evaluate exactly the utilization factors and the impact that the product will have on kind of the end-user productivity. As you remember, one of the big things here is to really drive the productivity elements of the end user through the introduction of hub, the integration of a number of other applications into that user interface to increase the relevance of the Unified Communication stack for the end user, and obviously keep our partners' brand more relevant to the end user.
And so part of the beta process is to measure all of that and to assess and to â both the UX, the integration, et cetera, and understand exactly the financial impact it will have on the end users in terms of increased productivity. The goal, obviously, is twofold. One of them is to increase the overall velocity in yield of our UC-One product. We'll also be evaluating the monetization of itself and what pricing models. And also, what ways to market we might actually sell a hub versus UC-One. So, all of that will be evaluated through the beta process along with our partners that are participating in our beta program.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then when might that contribute initial revenue?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
I think likely to look at 2017 when we'd be rolling out hub into kind of G8 product, so not this year.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. and I presume the deferred revenue which showed up earlier, is that fair to say?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, potentially â again I think the contribution is going to be pretty low at first to get the client. So it'll build over time.
George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC
Got it. Great. Thank you, guys.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Thanks, George.

Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. A couple of questions. First, can you tell us what the hosted sell-through growth was in the quarter? I think I heard you say it was record, but didn't hear the actual year-over-year number.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So well, we're really referring to Q1, I mean last year was high-20%s. We don't say per order, but I would say it was a very, very strong Q1.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So 20%-plus? Is that fair?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Oh yeah.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then on the outlook, it appears you're guiding Q2 a little bit below consensus, pretty much by the same degree, Q1 came in ahead. I was just hoping to understand if there was some business or expenses that were pulled forward and confirmed. There hasn't been a change in visibility or demand that drove the decision to be more conservative with respect to the near-term outlook?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
No. No, no. Look, we don't guide, as you know, on out quarters. So the consensus in Q2 was sort of a blip (21:35), wasn't driven by us. I think the community outlook for the quarter looks strong. The reaffirmation for the year, I think, is indicative of our feeling on the business so I wouldn't view us getting more conservative for the outlook being less robust for the quarter.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then it seems like the licensing business was pretty solid. Can you help us understand to what extent that was driven from hosted UC strength? How much of that may have been from realization of license sales and some of your network transformation projects? And is there any update on the network transformation project in terms of how many you have in the pipeline at this point in time and how many do you think will convert to revenue this year?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yes. So, I'll take the first part of that and let Mike talk more broadly on the network transformation project. I think the revenue in the quarter was pretty broad-based. We had double-digit growth in all geographies. That was both a good hosted and trunking quarter from a revenue perspective. And there was definitely contributions in the quarter from several of these network transformation projects, but I think you can see that also in the professional services revenue.
These are big projects that are going to see revenue for many, many years. And I think, as a general statement, we continue to prosecute them. We continue to work them. We continue to deliver them on time. And as Mike noted in his prepared remarks, I think you saw the product and when that product announcement of Vodafone Germany, which is Voda's largest property, to us, a huge deal, and I think again, indicative of the power of transformation project. The pipeline looks very solid. I think these are very large discrete projects.
Mike, I don't know if you...
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
I think I'd just say the same thing. I think the projects are delivering on time. As you see with the Vodafone projects, some of them are starting to move from network implementation into service implementation or service launch. We'll see more of those through the year. Overall, the pipeline for these kind of projects continues to look very good. And we're engaged in some of these projects and a number of, let me call, phases are lined up with service launches. So we'll launch a particular product or particular segment and then continue to grow through and add more segments through the transformation project. So lots of activity going on with the biggest operators in the world.
I think, clearly, you see this desire by those operators to collapse and close down their TDM infrastructures. Many of them have already announced the dates for shutting down their PSTNs. And we're certainly engaged with that on the business transformation side. And many operators as well are trying to transition away from a number of, let's call it, pre-IMS or older generation IP solutions to those single solution and we're engaged in a number of those re-architectures and reimplementation, so that they have single platform for all of their business services. So it continues to be a very strong part of our business, engages a fair amount of us in terms of continued development delivery, and we'll see some fairly large service launches like we have started to see this year throughout the year this year, and continue into 2017.
Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Dmitry Netis with William Blair.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey thanks, gentlemen. Nice quarter there. I want to dig in again on the software license billings number real quick. I mean, it was down a little bit, but how does that translate into the revenue license growth throughout the year? Can we still sort of expect you to grow license let's say commensurate with the revenue growth for the year? I guess we're looking at, what, 18%, 20% there?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that was part of the reaffirming the general guidance is â I think it's Q1 lumpiness. It's really not more than that. It was definitely the zip code of our internal expectations for Q1 that was building block for building the year. So I would take note of both guides for Q2 and the rest of the year. It's indicative of how we use this in the business, which I think is pretty positive.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks, Jim. Then, maybe on the customer or transformation project front, with the Vodafone Germany now launching, does that sort of imply that most of that deferred that you had kind of moved into the P&L and it becomes more of a SaaS based customer on-boarding revenue recognition process from here on?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
So, I don't want to be so specific on the revenue from Voda, but as a general statement, when we hit revenue milestone on these network transformation projects, then those projects do move into more of a normal revenue recognition basis. I'd say that's correct.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
How do you define normal, just, curious is that just every quarter you get a bit coming or was that semi-annually? Can you just kind of give us a little idea of what that means?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Fair enough. By normal I mean the software license revenue doesn't get deferred. So when we get a software license order, it's bill-ship revenue in the same quarter. Maintenance is no longer piling up on the balance sheet nor would professional services. So those things become, on an as-performed or a ratable basis. So that's really what I meant by normal. It depends on the carrier buying habits on what that software license frequency is. I'd say the most like is every couple quarters, fewer and fewer carriers order a year in advance. And some actually order quarterly but that can be operationally hard, so quite a few will settle almost every other quarter.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. And may be one more, if I may. On the BroadCloud, if I could jump there. That sent back nicely in the quarter. I mean, you're guiding high-$12 million, $13 million for June. I was just wondering, it sounds like you may expect the reacceleration in the back half or second half of the year for BroadCloud as well as you do with the rest of your business. Is that fair and what's driving that? I mean, is it Transera? Is it some of the other projects you have with maybe Vodafone, as you mentioned? And then also, maybe talk about quickly on the margin side. Where the margins are and where do you think you'll like the SaaS margins by the end of the year? Thanks, Jim.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Look, Dmitry, keep me honest on the question. Yeah, so, I think it was a solid BroadCloud for Q1. Obviously, there was some M&A impact with a partial quarter for Transera. And you also see that in the Q2 numbers. The back half, we think that business will continue to grow nicely into the back half driven by Transera, which I think has a really nice building pipeline. It's just SaaS that'll take a little while. We also have good activity with our four BroadCloud customers and we should start at least start seeing contribution from FedRAMP.
In terms of margin for Q1, for SaaS, we are in the mid-40%s. So that was up. I think that was a little wind-adjusted (31:50), but it's going to be kind of in the 40%s for the rest of the year is my expectation.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Very good. Thank you very much. Keep up the good work, Jim.

The next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you. Mike, I was hoping you could talk about the competitive landscape and in particular, what are your thoughts or if you've seen anything with respect to Microsoft's Skype for Business initiatives and their Cloud PBX initiative among other things? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah. I think kind of competitive-wise, things haven't changed dramatically since the last update. I think the overall kind of sales efforts by our partners continues (32:51) going very well, not seeing a tremendous amount of change in their environment obviously which is where Skype for Business would show up. I think, generally, the feedback is that especially on the, let's call it, on the hosted PBX side or the Skype for Business side; still fairly young product, missing lots of components.
People are a little bit concerned about overall call quality and requiring a fair number of components to make that solution work or as solutions provided by us, through our partners, really come with everything that those customers would need. At the same time, we continue to keep a careful eye on all the competition that our customers face (33:50) out in the marketplace. Obviously, there's more folks out there with cloud-based solutions or plans for a cloud-based solution and so we continue to kind of watch closely what folks like Microsoft or Cisco are doing in that space and adjusting strategies with our customers, our partners to make sure that we have the most competitive product out there so they can win those deals in the trenches for the enterprise business.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for that. And Mike, can you just remind us what you said in your sell-through comments for North America. You mentioned it pretty quick and I want to just make sure I have what you said about the North American sell-through.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah. I just made mention that while all the regions grew, North America really contributed in an outsized way to the overall beat on the large size for Q1 sell-through. So we're seeing obviously North America being a very mature market for hosted UC in many segments and kind of full execution mode, full delivery and then we're starting to see pickup in other markets. Western Europe is picking up obviously from a sell-through perspective. So, as markets get more and more mature and the end customers start to assess and, perhaps in a period of deciding whether or not to buy an additional PBX or other solution, hosted Unified Communications is becoming kind of the dominant choice. And therefore, we're seeing sell-through rate up throughout the very strong base. So that's a really good sign, long-term sign for the strength of the business.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO

Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks. I want to come back to that competitive landscape question in particular. I understand it's a big world out there and you've got an accelerating market. But RingCentral, which is now actually your size or a little bit larger, listening to their commentary, I'm sure you guys do, they're talking about growth â organic growth in the 30%s, if I remember the numbers correctly. And I'm wondering, Mike, are you all running into them more? They're going more up market and any commentary there? And then I've got a couple of quick discrete questions after that.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Well, I mean, again, we don't typically run into them obviously, directly into our main sales effort, which is signing up more distribution channels, more partners. Obviously our partners will run into them time-to-time. I don't think that â again, comparing a retail company's growth rates with an enabling technology growth rates is going to kind of be the same, kind of apples-to-oranges comparison. We're seeing our partners do extremely well in the marketplace. I'm sure they come across competition not only from RingCentral but from other BroadSoft-based providers. The market is pretty robust. It's pretty large. Lots of deal flow, so not really concerned about the competition out there as really kind of gating our ability to continue to grow. In addition, I think we obviously see that as a primarily U.S. phenomenon, maybe a couple of other places. We're distributing our product in 90 markets, lot of those markets where competition is extremely light compared to North America. So there's a kind of a good portfolio effect for us in terms of distribution of our licenses globally.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
And Paul, I'll just add, I mean the most robust part of the market is a small and then Ring is to the small end, and we have several customers that are bigger than Ring in terms of total fees and they are among our fastest-growing sell-through customers, and those kind of rates. So I think there's not only a software-enabling revenue to retail service provider revenue, but there's also a North American small business market segmentation side. So that we see a ton of accelerating growth in that part of market too.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. A couple of quick discrete questions. On the network transformation deals, I know you announced Vodafone. Were there any new awards in the first quarter or are there any expected awards in the second quarter with balance of calendar 2016? And then, on OpEx investment, Jim, where is the additional dollars going? On Transera employee retention, has there been any meaningful churn? And then on your FedRAMP contribution statement, what type of contribution do you expect through the balance of this year?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
All right. Let's start with, I guess, network transformation. There wasn't a major transformation due in Q1. The pipeline was good. I think there'll be more added throughout the year. I'm not going to be specific to Q2, but we're also â we want several of the biggest ones you can win in the world and so those continue to be driven and delivered by, let's see, Transera, no meaningful employee loss at all. In fact, I think, quite the opposite. It's a great team. We're really excited about having them on. And they have hit the ground running out with their customers and our service provider customers. The interest level with the combined now BroadCloud Contact Center and BroadWorks and BroadCloud is, I think, really promising. So I think, it's all good on that.
On FedRAMP, again, we think that there'll be contract wins this year, will be in the market. I think the actual meaningful revenue contribution will start in 2017 as if it's fast, but I think there's a ton of opportunity once we get through the regulatory approval process by the government.

And where's the OpEx investment go?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sorry. I forgot. I thought I had them all. So it's a combination of a full quarter of Transera R&D and sales.

Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty & Company.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Good morning, gentlemen. My question is, Mike, you said in your prepared remarks about France and the new system integrator that you launched in France. Does this change your overall strategy? For a long time, you only sold directly to the carriers and it looks like in order to expand maybe your addressable market, you're going after system integrators. And a follow-on question to that is, how is that impacting the carriers in some of your more tier 2, tier 3 carriers that have been relying on BroadWorks for their solutions? Thank you.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Sure, Catharine. I think the easy way to look at this is that the anchor tenants in France is traditional business within PBX distribution. Their desire frankly is to become a cloud service provider. So, I think we're not selling under our brand, still a branded solution by another partner and they do have the desire to really move their businesses from equipment distribution to being a cloud service provider, not only distributing our products but potentially other cloud service elements to their enterprise customer base. So I think in some cases what we'll see is traditional distribution-type businesses who know their end users very well, who've been in PBX distribution marketplace morphed into being a service provider or managed service provider of some sort and that continues to â therefore, we'll continue to be a wholesaler to those parties, not a retailer in the marketplace.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. And then the follow-on question is North America was very, very strong. Can you give us a â divvy up perhaps, was it BroadWorks, obviously not flat (44:27) BroadCloud hosted, our SIP trunking how was it weighted for the quarter and then was it weighted more towards tier 1s or tier 2s or cable operators?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
So, it was actually pretty good trunking quarter, very low on consumer, so hosted was still the bulk of the revenue in the quarter. It was, from a selling standpoint, more tier 1 oriented especially in the U.S. Cable, we had huge Q4 cable quarter. And so in that kind of cadence of a lot of the carriers don't order every quarter. It was not a strong cable quarter on the sell-in, but back to previous conversation, cable which tends to be 50 seats and below in North America is on a huge sell-through pace, so really doing exceptionally well.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks, gentlemen.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO

Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey guys, it's Tavis. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got a few of them. First, Jim, were there any 10% customers on a revenue rec basis in the quarter?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. We had a 10% customer.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. And then Mike you mentioned the full branding strategy I think specifically in relation to Vodafone. Anything there as you grow that strategy that would impact your thoughts on the ultimate margin structure of the business?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
No. No. I think what we're doing with the co-marketing and co-branding activity is really working to amplify the messaging of that our partners are delivering to marketplace. So it's not a big change in the cost structure and the overall margin. Really our belief is that these efforts will increase the quality, the overall velocity of the service into the marketplace. The overall yield that the service attained in terms of sell-through, so I think we don't see any margin impact to the business as we move from a kind of a no-branding environment for the end user to a co-marketing co-branding world.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. And then two other quick ones. First, I think Jim you mentioned earlier that there were some network transformation revenue rec in professional services in the quarter. Was there any in license software?
And then, Mike, on your deal with the traditional PBX distributor in France, is that a situation where they're also reselling cloud solutions from a Mitel, Avaya, Cisco as well or have they changed strategy completely to only sell white labeled solution and are you seeing any movement in that regards as it relates to the substantial North American traditional PBX resellers. Thanks.
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
Yeah, certainly. I'll jump on the second question and then Jim can answer the first. So, on the PBX reseller, they were predominantly a single brand that they were reselling in the marketplace. They did on occasion sell multiple brand PBXs, but that they were well-known and it's kind of a dominant share in a particular brand. Their view is to basically have a single-branded solution using their brand. So they will not be reselling somebody else's solution into their marketplace.
So what we're seeing, as I mentioned before, is really a company looking to reposition from hardware distribution to being cloud and recurring revenue company. As I mentioned before, it is likely that they may sell ancillary thing for it, et cetera, other things as they move from being kind of a hardware distribution to a managed service provider. Also, probably, it's safe to say that this particular company is more mid-market centric than SMB. So we see kind of they're leveraging their integration, delivery, support infrastructure that they had built for years in support of a PBX business, to support this kind of the cloud delivery business that they're launching with us.
And your last question which is around, did we see others? I do think we're seeing the next generation of a lot of distribution-based companies looking at should they change their business models? A few of them are reselling other branded hosted solutions. I think many of them are considering whether or not they should make a more dramatic business change. We do have a few small ones that have PBX bases in the U.S. that have already kind of migrated their businesses to managed service. And I suspect we'll see more of that through 2017 and 2018. And I think, as Jim said, as the hosted market moves from SaaS to medium â in the big medium market, let's say, call it 100 to 500 seats, or 100 to 1,000 seats, we'll see more of those PBX distributors have to make some decisions about shifting into the hosted UC marketplace.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
And Tavis, yes, the software revenue line item definitely had revenue recognition from transformation projects in it.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Thanks a lot. On the professional services line, do you expect that to be stable this year, grow a little bit, down a little bit? How do you think about professional services for the year?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So my expectation on PS is you'll see growth through the year on PS, but I guess my view on â I don't expect Q4 in 2014 to be in the magnitude of 2015, which was pretty outsized but yeah, I'd expect quarterly growth generally in PS this year.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Okay. Got it. And then on the trunking or SIP trunking, what percent of revenue or bookings was that in the quarter?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
I mean, it's just a quarter but it was actually a little higher than normal. It trends to be in the high-teens and it was actually in the 20%s.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Capital Markets
Okay. And then just last on Transera. In terms of just the client (53:02) you're looking at there, what size contact center was there or kind of in that pipeline? Is it 20 to 50 seats, is it over 100 seats, kind of a mix? How do you see the pipeline in terms of size of contact centers you're going after there?
Michael Tessler - President and CEO
I think we're actually â as we've gone out since the acquisition and started to meet with all of our distribution partners, we're seeing actually a worldwide variety of deals. We've closed some, what I would call, small deals, and let's say sub-50 â around a 50 seat area, and so we see some of the channels lining up and looking at those, let me call them, 25 seat or 100 seat segment. But we've also identified a number of very large contact centers in the 100-plus seats, maybe 1,000 seats and above in the pipeline. So I think we're actually seeing a product which we're very satisfied with, being able to scale from very small.
We have very specific product SKUs (54:20) and packaging for the very small, to the medium, to the very large contact centers, and the product's reception competitively is being received very strong. People see it as a very strong replacement for their very large contact centers. I think the caveat there is, as everybody understands is, a process to win a few thousand seat contact center and actually new implementation is quite lengthy. So, like we talked about network transformation deals from a carrier side, large contact centers will have a fairly lengthy procurement and then implementation cycle. So what we're hoping to see in the pipeline this year is a good mix of these longer-term deals or larger deals that we may close and start to implement on. And then a number of our distribution partners being effective in the, what I call, the smaller 25 seat to 100 seat space which procure and implement in a much faster timeline.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Capital Markets

Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Quick question is around, how should we look at new customers and also repeat orders from current customers and where I'm coming from is, you've been building a pipeline of VoIP network transformation projects recently. So help us understand in recent quarters what has been the trend in terms of getting repeat business, incremental business from some of these early VoIP transformation projects. And in any given quarter, how should we look at â roughly what's the mix between net new opportunities, net new customers versus repeat business from current customers? Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'm reminded of the Donald Rumsfeld quote about targets at the beginning of the Afghan conflict was, you don't have â there are not that many new carrier customers to be had. And we continue to work those and win those, but most of the business comes from our existing customers. It's well into the 90%s in any quarter. And most of that is really from projects that are in market, although obviously carriers are adding â like the Vodafone Germany announcement, new applications are being delivered every quarter. So it's definitely growth is predominantly from existing customers.
I'm sorry, Vijay, what was the other question?
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
The other question is in any given quarter, Jim, how should we look at repeat business from current customers versus net new business? I think where I was coming from is help us understand the propensity of these set of customers to buy incrementally or is it just you get an initial baseline award from one of these customers and then it's relatively difficult to get incremental business from the customers, like are you mostly kind of working on the baseline set of projects or you're also working on like the repeat orders from your current customers?
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Is it specifically on network transformation or just generally?
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
It's specifically on network transformation. So, I want to understand once you kind of exhaust or work on the baseline build of network transformation, what is the propensity of getting additional orders from these network transformation projects? Thanks.
James Albert Tholen - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Yeah, because I say as a general statement on our overall business, I mean I can't even think of any customers that have, that order so much upfront that we don't â that we're working that kind of nut off and we're not getting follow-on orders once they're in market. I mean these days, carriers just don't want to tie up a ton of capital in capacities or inventories.
On the network transformation deals, I mean we're pretty early on in these deals. I mean we're just starting to see revenue recognition on a few of them. I would say at this point, we have not seen reorder as a general statement on the network transformation deals, we're still â a lot of times it's all on the balance sheet, if it's not on the balance sheet, there's some upfront software or we've gotten a software order. We've been able to take that to revenue, but we're early enough. Some of the first ones, yes, we have gotten subsequent software orders, but those were kind of at the head of the class, early, early on. So, just a couple of them.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Jim.
