Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Michael and welcome to Mazor fourth quarter 2017 conference call. I want to start with our vision. It includes four components; growth, evidence-based medicine, strategic and economic value, and innovation. Converting this vision to reality and results have become a Mazor trademark. Each element was clearly demonstrated in the fourth quarter and cemented our market leadership.
We had a record quarter, capping off the year of cumulative record system sales, recurrent revenues, and revenues. The cumulative number of Mazor X orders received as of December 2017, 16 months after launch, is 98. The cumulative number of procedures performed to date using Mazor Core base system exceeds 30,000.
In terms of evidence-based medicine, the results of the prospective study was shared at NASS this quarter, demonstrating superior patient outcome when using our robotic guidance systems as compared to freehand.
In terms of building strategic and economic value, the partnership with Medtronic is doing well with engagement extending across the Medtronic organization. In terms of innovation, 2017 was clearly a year of progression beginning with the FDA clearance of the X-Align advanced planning software.
The innovation parade continued with the demonstration at NASS of the co-development, which will result in integration of Medtronic's market-leading stealth system into our market-leading Mazor X robotic guidance platform. This is where we want to be and these factors position Mazor for continued long-term success.
Focusing back on 2017 system sales and growth, as we closed on January 8, we received purchase orders for 27 systems in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily from U.S. customers for the Mazor X systems.
For the 2017 full year, we received purchase orders for 73 systems, of which 64 were for the Mazor X system and nine were for the Renaissance system. We have surpassed our anticipated penetration rate, which resulted in an early transition to the global distribution with Medtronic.
2018 is expected to be a year of transition and our performance is expected to be driven primarily by increased [Indiscernible] revenues from the expanding installed base. Long-term, we would anticipate the installed base to expand considerably during the length of the global distribution agreement. Over the next five years, the largest result is a cumulative purchase of hundreds of Mazor X systems, which are expected to significantly accelerate procedure volume and growth.
Let me provide more details on the commercial activity and system purchase orders. We received purchase orders for 27 robotic guidance systems, of which 24 were for the Mazor X and three were for the Renaissance. Of the 24 Mazor X systems, 23 were ordered by Medtronic and it has assumed full global responsibility for the distribution of the Mazor X system.
The additional Mazor X was a deferred order prior to the global distribution provision date. Of the three Renaissance systems, one came from a U.S. customer and the other two came from distribution partner in Germany and Thailand.
On a global basis, we ended the year with more than 180 systems installed worldwide; with over 120 of these in the U.S. Additionally, as of December 31st, we had a system backlog of 16 systems, which includes 14 Mazor X systems.
Procedural growth is increasing with our installed base growth and we are proud to report over 32,000 cumulative patient procedures with more than 220,000 implants placed. On an annual basis, we continue to be pleased with utilization of the Renaissance and Mazor X systems.
We believe the mounting clinical evidence, which includes more than 50 peer-reviewed papers demonstrating the safety, reliability, and predictability of our technology and the published results from the MIS -- from the MIS ReFRESH ongoing prospective study will continue to drive procedure use and growth. Procedure use has been shown as a reliable predictor for future sales. More on this later during my prepared remarks.
I want to review and provide an update on our future strategies and priorities. As many of you know, in late Q3, we entered a global distribution sale with our strategic partner, Medtronic, where it has assumed exclusive global responsibility for Mazor X's commercial activity for spine surgery.
The transition to the global distribution sale occurred ahead of schedule due to the remarkable efforts of that -- [Indiscernible] Mazor capital team, many of whom have now transitioned successfully to Medtronic. Our two organizations accomplished a non-disruptive and successful transition. The immediate goal was to ensure a seamless process and maintain momentum through Q4 2017.
In addition to the sales and marketing, Medtronic is also responsible to train and provide clinical support and education for the Mazor X. However, we will continue to provide the service and maintenance of the systems going forward.
The Mazor X capital and clinical salesforce that joined Medtronic are now fully integrated into its organization. They continue carrying the Mazor X banner and are spearheading the sales effort for the Mazor X platform within Medtronic.
At the regional Medtronic sales meeting recently, which included hundreds of representatives, significant focus was given to the Mazor X, and the enthusiasm was very apparent. With Medtronic now being fully responsible for marketing the Mazor X, our sales effort is focused on the Renaissance.
As a reminder, our primary focus for the Renaissance is the Ambulatory Surgery Center, or ASCs, a market segment that we believe will take advantage of the system's value pricing.
In the U.S., we believe there are approximately 1,000 ASCs that would benefit from using the Renaissance system. At the same time, we don't believe this will cannibalize any Mazor X system sales due to the case volume and system costs.
Internationally, we continue to work with our partner to expand our penetration to existing as well as new markets with the Renaissance systems. This past quarter, we received orders in Europe and Asia, so it demonstrates our commitment to our partners and interest level for the Renaissance.
This commitment, however, goes far beyond our partners. It's our customers and the patient and to the overall health care environment. This is why we initiated prospective studies in 2014 to highlight patient outcome even at a time when the stakes were much higher for Mazor. The data on nearly 400 patients was shared for the first time in October at NASS. The response then and since has been positive.
As a reminder, nine surgeons using the Renaissance system, which like the Mazor X, is powered by our proprietary Mazor Core technology, demonstrated a fivefold reduction in surgical complications and a sevenfold reduction in minimal invasive revision surgery compared with the controlled group that used freehand technique.
These are statistically significant results and far superior compared to the controlled group of a minimally invasive freehand-based lumbar fusion surgery. We have never backed away from the challenge and I would encourage anyone else to do as we have to demonstrate the belief in their technology and to validate the clinical proposition with evidence-based medicine. We have gladly taken the mantle in spine robotics.
Mazor is recognized for being an innovative company. We take great pride in identifying and developing new product that provides better outcome for patients and their providers. Our technology generates excitement, both internally and externally and surgeons and hospitals have valued our product.
At the most recent NASS Meeting in October, we provided a peek into the future of our collaboration efforts with Medtronic. We showcased the combination of the best of navigation -- Medtronic's stealth navigation and the best of robotics, together with the ability for robotic-guided implant placement.
Mazor continues to push the envelope technologically with advances in every direction necessary for Mazor's futuristic OR hub, combining connectivity, advanced planning, and future robotics technologies to become a reality.
2017 marked the entry of competing systems through the surgical robotics field. Our approach and one that we have shared for the past couple of years is that a rising tide raises all ships. We believe this will help drive and educate the market for surgical robots.
Already and due in large part of Mazor's effort, the question regarding robotic had shifted from do I need a robot to how can robotics do more for me? We are committed to staying at the forefront of this field.
Our advanced technology team will continue breaking new grounds in robotic surgeries. We have only scratched the surface of the spine market. It remains our primary market focus, but we are pursuing strategies to develop Mazor's business beyond our current spine focus, where we know we can add value economically and clinically.
Now, to review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter, I will turn the call over to Sharon. Sharon?
Sharon Levita
Thank you, Ori and hello everyone. I will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue for the three months ended December 31st, 2017 was $19.1 million, an increase of 36% compared to $14 million in the year ago fourth quarter.
Geographically, revenue in the U.S. increased 38% to $17.4 million compared to $12.6 million in the year ago fourth quarter, representing 91% of total revenue. $1.7 million or 9% of revenue originated from sales in the international market.
Capital sales revenue was $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we recognized revenue from 24 systems compared to revenue from 18 systems in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As Ori referred earlier, the new pricing model for the Mazor X under the global distribution phase with Medtronic is at lower per system rate compared to the rate we had been realizing through our direct sales channel that's impacting the average selling price. We ended the fourth quarter with a backlog of 16 systems, 14 of which are Mazor X systems.
Recurring revenue from disposable kit sales grew to $5.9 million or 119% compared to $2.7 million in the last year's fourth quarter, reflecting the increase in our installed base, primarily in the U.S. market. Revenue from service and others increased 89% to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.8 million in the year ago fourth quarter.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 59.3% compared to 70.5% in the last year's fourth quarter. This expected decrease is a combination of the higher manufacturing cost of the Mazor X system compared to the Renaissance system and the new pricing model mentioned earlier. In addition, the gross margin was impacted by the execution of three Renaissance trade-in to Mazor X system with lower pricing.
Operating expense were $11.4 million compared to $14.2 million in the year ago fourth quarter, mainly due to lower sales and marketing expense following the transition to global distribution phase of the Medtronic partnership. As a reminder, effective September 18th, 2017, Medtronic is responsible for global sales and marketing activities relating to Mazor X system for spinal application.
On a GAAP basis, the net income for the fourth quarter was $0.4 million or $0.01 per share compared to a net loss of $4.3 million or $0.09 per share in the 2016 fourth quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the net income for the fourth quarter was $1.9 million or $0.03 per share compared to $3.1 million or $0.07 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As noted, in reviewing the operating expense for the fourth quarter, the entry to global distribution agreement with Medtronic is expected to deliver significant savings to Mazor by reducing our full year 2018 sales and marketing expense, while the expected savings will be approximately $13 million.
The revenue from Mazor X capital systems and disposable will also affected by the distribution model pricing with Medtronic. We currently believe this will likely result in an overall modest revenue growth for this year. Beyond 2018, the revenue growth is expected to accelerate and be driven primarily by the expanded installed base and increasing recurring revenue.
Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $3.8 million compared to $1.9 million cash used in the last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in cash used in the period is primarily due to the quarter's strong collection and lower operating expense following the transition to the global distribution with Medtronic.
We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalent of $108.3 million, which includes the third equity tranche investment of $40 million we received from Medtronic, as we transition from the global distribution phase of the agreement.
That concludes my remark and I will pass the call back to Ori for his summary comments. And then, we will take questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Sharon. At the end of 2016, we set a very high cross-organizational bar for 2017. The entire Mazor team pulled through in 2017, met expectations, and was a year of accelerated growth.
I want to thank the Mazor team, those that are still with Mazor and those who transitioned to Medtronic in Q4. Their dedication and commitment made it happen and has helped us to achieve our vision.
2018 will be a transition year with emphasis on synergy with Medtronic as well as utilization and procedure growth. We are encouraged by the overall optimism and enthusiasm of the consensus and with a touch of realism for 2018. Thank you again for joining the call.
Operator, we're now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Jeffrey Cohen
Good morning Ori and Sharon. Can you hear me okay?
Ori Hadomi
Yes Jeff, good morning.
Sharon Levita
Good morning.
Jeffrey Cohen
Congratulations on a great quarter and year and producing cash in the fourth quarter. So, just a couple of questions if I may. Ori, could you talk a little bit about some of the R&D activities as it relates to the X platform and some of the further functionality as far as what we've seen and heard about in the past, such as additional software and rod-bending capabilities?
Ori Hadomi
Sure. We are dedicating a lot of our resources these days in order to keep our innovation ahead. We're developing technologies, both at the forefront areas as well as the hardware and we're also trying to gain the best we can for the synergy with the Medtronic technologies.
So, I did mention earlier that we plan later this year to introduce the integration between the stealth technology and the Mazor X and to basically be able to combine the best of our worlds, the best of navigation together with the best of robotics, and to allow the surgeons to gain the benefit of both in one system.
And we believe that this will -- this opened the door to many new technologies and procedures -- and clinical procedures that would be enabled by the combination of these two. This is just the very beginning. We have a very promising roadmap of technologies and products that we're working on that, I believe, we will be able to introduce in the following year.
Jeffrey Cohen
Okay, got it. And secondly and lastly, could you give us a little more color as far as trends or lessons learned as far as utilization out there on the X platform? Could you talk a little bit about facility-specific utilization, types of levels, types of cases, types of approach? Just give us a little more color there, please. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
Yes Jeff. So, I would say, in general, in terms of the type of cases and the type of indications, it's not very different from what we had in the past when we introduced the Renaissance. I do think that the adoption is faster and the learning curve is better because at that time, it was -- we were probably the only one and also the perception for robotic was very different.
So, we do enjoy today very nice acceptance. And relative to the time we are in the market with the Mazor X, we're very pleased with utilization and the growth of the utilization. It is still not where the Renaissance was and we were at -- by the peak of the Renaissance marketing campaign, but based on the penetration curve that we have, we're very pleased with the adoption and the way it translated to utilization.
I also -- I would also want to add is that I think the last quarter was a very important quarter because this was the first quarter where the Medtronic reps began to support the case with robot and this was a critical quarter for us. We didn't know how much training will further be needed and how efficient it will be.
And overall, I think that the preparations were appropriate and the team is working very -- as smooth as -- the joint team works very effectively together to support the cases.
Jeffrey Cohen
Perfect. Thank you very much.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you, Jeff.
Operator
Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
Larry Biegelsen
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question guys. One, just some numbers to just better understand the placements in the quarter one on competition. So, Ori, of the 27 orders placed, how many were placed in Q4? And of the placements, how many were trade-ins?
I'm trying to understand the change in the installed base. It looks like it was about 10. You had 172 at the end of Q3. You said over 180 at the end of Q4. And I had a follow-up on competition.
Sharon Levita
Okay. Hi Larry, this is Sharon. So, the installed base we mentioned over 180 and was actually 188 this quarter, so -- and we recognized this quarter 24. Not all what you recognize today is installed; some goes through the Medtronic inventory and then later on installed.
Larry Biegelsen
Got it. So, it looks like the installed base went up from 172 to 188, so 16. That's helpful. And then just Ori, it would be helpful to get your perspective on competition. Obviously, Q4 was the first quarter where you had real competition. It looks like your installed base went up by about 16. They placed 11 or 12 robots. Is that kind of trend in terms of share of placement? Is that something you expect going forward? Can you give us any qualitative commentary on head-to-head evaluations with the competitor, what you're seeing, percent to win? And any impact on the selling cycle would be helpful. Thanks for taking the questions guys.
Ori Hadomi
Sure. Thank you, Larry. We're trying to answer the question. Not sure if we have answers to all your questions, but to just to give you some sense. I think it's too early to make conclusions about how the competition will impact the sales cycle and the adoption acceptance -- exception.
I think that, right now, Globus is making the first steps in their selling [ph] systems. It will have an impact on the sales cycle. There's no doubt about it. I think that surgeons would like to compare and to benchmark within the two systems and they will take their time. So, I have no doubt that it will have an impact on the sales cycle.
In terms of preferences, I think that right now, I didn't hear yet, I didn't see yet, any real report about the clinical results and the customer satisfaction from the Globus systems. So, I think they will take some time until they will be able to build sufficient volume, so that also the surgeon's community will be aware to what they can get and what they can't get from each of the systems.
At this point of time, I believe that Mazor and Medtronic -- actually, Medtronic selling really markedly focused on evident and in validated data with the technology. And at this point of time, Globus is marketing based on their vision and promise and what they hope and believe the technology can generate. And I think that the time -- it will take some time until the market will be able to compare in clinical conditions, the two systems.
As I said earlier, I'm not concerned with this competition. I think that the fact that now two significant players in the spine market running robotic technology and I think that the rules of the game been changed. And it's very clear today that in order to be a player on this market, you need to have a robotic technology. I think that the fact that two big players is doing it, it helps a lot in setting the tone that robotic is here to stay. This is the toolbox of the -- for the surgeons. And I believe that the days that in every single case, robotic will be used and not that far from us. And the market is really big enough to accommodate these two systems.
So, I'm really not confirmed. And I think that while it will have an impact, I have absolutely no doubt about it. I think that the bounce that we see maybe -- would be primarily in the short-term. But after a year or a few quarters, we will be able to see the two companies or maybe others running in parallel and developing themselves.
Larry Biegelsen
That's very helpful. Let me sneak one last one question in here Ori. The synergy with Medtronic, another key focus for you in 2018. You receive it now as -- on an average for systems utilizing Medtronic's implants. So, we estimate in Q4 about 5% of your procedures using Medtronic implants and we estimate that going up to about 10% exiting 2018. Would you be willing to kind of comment on those numbers and your expectations on those percentages? Thanks for taking the questions.
Ori Hadomi
Larry, I -- first, thank you for asking this question. In our internal estimations, we assume that in 2018, the numbers will be very, very low. I don't remember it was below 5% or below 10%, but was really low. We didn't want to make any assumptions around the use of the Medtronic implants in our cases, primarily because as you may know in the past, very, very few, I think it was less than 5% -- in less than 5% of the cases where the Renaissance was used, Medtronic implants were used.
When we look at the numbers from the last quarter, we were positively surprised. Without going specific of the numbers because I don't -- we didn't report this, I can tell that the contribution of what we call the synergy field the implant fee exceeded what we expected. So, we're very pleased with the synergy between the technology and the Medtronic implants.
We also heard that Medtronic is very pleased with their ability to develop more volume and more adoption of their technologies in some of the sites where the robots have been installed.
So, overall, I think the parties are very pleased with the contribution of the synergy between robotics and spine technologies to developing the business and the clinical results.
Larry Biegelsen
Thanks for taking the questions guys.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]
We'll take our next question from Young Li with Barclays.
Young Li
Hey Ori and Sharon, thanks for taking our questions. So, congrats on a successful 2017. I guess turning to 2018, you mentioned the modest revenue growth and also it's a transitional year. Can you maybe help us understand the components that drive the topline, including maybe your citations on unit growth, the price declines due to Medtronic or maybe the mix between the X as well as Renaissance?
Ori Hadomi
Sure. Yes, I think that overall, the message that -- the tone that we'd tried to set and the expectation were that, overall, what we expect is that we've said as a result that this will be a year of transition. We expect that this will be a year where the organizations will build a synergy and integration. And we will put a lot of effort in the simulation and adoption of the technology in the market.
We do expect to see growth in the installed base. But we've -- due to the economic and the business model, we expect that at the end of the year, the -- that we will see growth in the revenues from the recurrent revenues, but I don't expect to see growth in the revenue that's coming from the capital system.
So, overall, we talked about revenues that will be similar or what you call modest growth to 2017. And the two main components of the recurrent revenue and then the capital according to the trend that I mentioned earlier.
Young Li
Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then another question on the gross margins. It came in below expectations, understanding the Medtronic transition will impact gross margins. I guess the press release also mentioned that manufacturing of X is higher than the Renaissance. Can you maybe talk about that dynamic a little bit more? Also at your Analyst Day in mid-2016, I think you talked about gross margins of around 70% by 2020. So, maybe if you can talk about the pathway to 70%.
Ori Hadomi
Yes. So, what I would say, as we mentioned also in the past, the cost of goods of the Mazor X is far more expensive than the Renaissance. One of the things that's very unique about both of our products is that we didn't buy a shelf robot and develop a software to control it. We developed the robot from scratch, including the -- all its components and we manufacture it.
So, we can -- we really can control all its features and capabilities. But it has its cost because we manufacture it for our volume. And we expect that once the volume will increase, then the cost will decrease.
Right now, as you mentioned, the gross profit is lower than what you have probably expected because of the economic model and the cost of goods of Mazor X. But still, we are -- we believe that in the long-term, we will meet the numbers that we mentioned at that meeting in 2016. And this will be primarily due to the contribution, both of the recurrent revenues, the synergy field, and the reduction in the cost of goods due to the volume and efficiencies.
Young Li
All right guys. Thank you for taking our questions.
Ori Hadomi
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.
Mike Matson
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just curious how Medtronic is supporting the procedures. I know, with Mazor, you had a capital salesforce and a procedural salesforce. So with Medtronic, is that really up to the actual implant reps to cover those cases?
And if it is, I guess, I'm just wondering what happens when, as you mentioned, the surgeons, a lot of them are not using Medtronic implants currently. So, does that rep still have to go to those cases if their implants are not being used? And how do you ensure that the robot gets utilized in those cases?
Ori Hadomi
Yes. It's a great question and I think that it will be better to ask Medtronic about this. I can tell you, Medtronic has a lot of experience in supporting cases with capital equipment. They sell the stealth [Indiscernible] and when they sell these systems, these technologies are used in many different cases independent of what kind of implantable products are used.
So, they have their teams that know to support both their implants. If their implants are used as well as the technology, it's not necessarily their implants are used. And they have their own division that support each one of these cases. And they adopted these strategies also in supporting the Mazor X.
Overall, we're very pleased with the way they support the cases. We believe that they are training the right people and they are investing in training and coaching the team. And I -- to be honest, I thought that the learning curve will be longer. But right now, I think that we're pleased with the progress.
Mike Matson
Okay. Thanks. And then with regard to this stealth navigation project that you have, would that be backwards-compatible? In other words, we're not going to end up in a situation where as we get closer to the launch of that, the customers just wait to -- until when they can buy both of the systems together, both the robotics and the navigation capability? Or can they -- if they have an X right now, can they then upgrade to the stealth system compatibility later?
Ori Hadomi
The development is fast that we will be able to offer an add-on upgrade kit that we'll be able to fill the navigation and upgrade installed base.
Mike Matson
Okay. Thanks. And then final question--
Ori Hadomi
[Indiscernible]
Mike Matson
Yes, I understand. My final question is you said you're not going to -- you're no longer going to be preannouncing system sales and so forth. But I guess I'm just wondering when you do report your quarterly results, what sort of metrics are you going to be giving us? Are you going to continue to give us orders? And I mean you'll tell us how many systems you're recognizing I guess. And then what about the installed base, will you be able to tell us the installed base on a quarterly basis?
Ori Hadomi
We will talk primarily on the revenues. And as to the installed base, yes, we will -- I believe we will report installed base, yes.
Mike Matson
Okay. Thank you.
Ori Hadomi
