Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you everybody for joining us today. Nearly two years ago we laid out the Molson Coors revitalization plan, a multi-year strategy to deliver a sustainable top line growth that has alluded our business for many years, while at the same time delivering sustainable bottom line growth.
Under the plan we have streamlined the company only reinvesting those savings to build on the strength of our iconic call, aggressively grow our above premium portfolio, expand beyond the beer aisle, enhance our capabilities and support our people and communities. We had a few doubters then and we had some unexpected challenges since from a global pandemic to severe Texas winter storms to a cyber-attack in our company. But nearly two years later we can say to those doubters with confidence that Molson Coors is on a path to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth. Our performance this quarter speaks for itself. I say that because for nearly two years, we've talked a lot about the outputs of our revitalization plan, new investments, new partnerships, new product launches and new campaigns. So today we're able to start talking meaningfully the outcomes from the revitalization plan and that's an important shift.
In the second quarter, despite ongoing pandemic restrictions, we delivered the most top line growth of any quarter in over a decade and we nearly achieved 2019 net sales revenue levels on a constant currency basis despite this pandemic restrictions during this quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with this progress, but it's a strong indicator of what is yet to come through our revitalization plan. Our progress was primarily driven by three things. First, it was driven by the fact that we delivered the best brand mix in the United States since the inception of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008. This significant premiumization of our portfolio was led by the strong growth of our US hard seltzers where we doubled our share of the US hard seltzer segment in the second quarter. We took over as the global brewer with the fastest growing US seltzer portfolio and we recently passed another major brewer in our fourth in total US seltzer share as we continue to move towards our goal of achieving a 10 share in the US by year-end. Those are outcomes. We are also continuing to see strong traction with our busy innovation. With these fast turning new Lemonade variety pack help the Vizzy brand gain almost a full point of US share in the second quarter, and we just added another new package to their family with Vizzy Watermelon, which has been a hit with retailers thus far.
Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continues to exceed our expectations in the 16 markets in which is sold it's the US. The demand is far outpaced our original plans for the brand and with supply improving we are now positioned to be more aggressive in marketing this brand. That is an outcome. Outside of the US, our Canadian Hard Seltzer portfolio continues to perform very well. The combination of Vizzy and Chris Hard Seltzer as I mean more than a 50 share of the hard seltzer category with the largest beer retailer in the country. Vizzy specifically is in the number 1 spot in the on-premise in key regions like Ontario and we're looking forward to fuel this momentum with Vizzy Lemonade, which launched in Canada, just a few weeks ago. That's an outcome.
In Europe, Three Fold in the UK and Wai Moment in Central and Eastern Europe, continue to build distribution and consumer awareness with a strong mix of brand advertising. The category is still it's in early stage, but we are well positioned to win share and develop our portfolio as popularity around hard seltzers continues to grow. And what our fast growing hard seltzer portfolio is driving our premiumization is not alone, Madri continues to exceed expectations in the UK on premise with unprecedented consumer demand and Pravha [ph] brands is performing ahead of expectations in the Central and Eastern European markets, beating initial estimates by more than 50%.
Our Latin American business where our global brands primarily operate in the above premium price segment has exceeded expectations given the corona virus pandemic throughout the region. Collectively, for the first half of 2021 the region is exceeding brand volume levels for the comparable 2019 period despite continued government issued pandemic restrictions. For example, our Puerto Rican operations, which had been in long-term decline are currently growing. Those are outcomes. In Canada, our Six Pints Cross Division is growing absolute volume despite its reliance on the on-premise. In the US Blue Moon Light Sky was the number one new beer item in 2020 and has grown double digits this year, building off its strong base while Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy brand volume is up 10% year to date, further outcomes.
And then, just a few weeks, the Yuengling joint venture will launch in the State of Texas where distributor, retailer and customer interest has been incredibly high. Product shipments begin next week and is scheduled to hit retail by August 23rd. The other factor the drove the best brand in more than a decade is a rationalization of the long tail of our economy portfolio in the US. As we have discussed, in recent months in the US, we post production of a number of smaller low margin slow moving economy brands and SKUs. This allowed us to improve our brewing efficiency and stabilize inventories of our core brands, and it also premiumized our portfolio and improved our margins. We intend to maintain that high level of premiumization service. So after an extensive analysis of our business, we are meaningfully streamlining and premiumizing our US portfolio, discontinuing around 100 SKUs, including the elimination of 11 economy brands altogether. This will improve supply chain flexibility for our more profitable priority brands, enhance our innovation efforts, enable us to better focus resources and ensure dependable and on-time shipments to our distributors.
Let's be clear; while economy brands is typically not been a focus of the investment community, distributors as you saw brands like Magnum and Mickey's are going to feel it when they are discontinued. So our local sales teams are partnering with distributors and retailers on a market-by-market basis on exit plans and to identify swaps that makes sense. So, the headline is simple premiumization is here to state Molson Coors. We're going to invest bigger behind our fast growing global hard seltzer portfolio and we are going to permanently streamline a smaller portfolio of legacy brands. We are excited about the progress we're making and we're not about to stop now. Our top line growth is also driven by the strength of our core brands and the pace of the return to the on-premise, Coors Light and Miller Lite, a grain brew share of the US premium light segment. With on-premise accounts reopening in a big way across the US, the brands were at 97% of their total 2019 STR volume in the second quarter. Coors Light specifically achieved its best half year share trend in 4 years and its US STRs rose by 1.7% in the second quarter. At the same time Miller Lite grew 3.2% in the US in the quarter.
In Canada, Coors Light is growing share with our largest retail customer for four straight quarters. Our top line growth was also aided by the investments we have made in our beyond beer initiatives. Standing here at the end of July, Bella has already far surpassed our expectations for the entire year, and its current owner Dwayne Johnson continues to amplify the product across his massive social media presence as well as through a new TV campaign debuted during the Olympics this month.
The RTD coffee market is estimated at $4.3 billion in 2021 and La Colombe was ranked number one in the above premium category. We're excited about the progress we are making and continue to have success with distribution to large national and regional retailers in both the drug and convenience-store channels. Truss Canada, our joint venture with HEXO has grown to more than a 50 share of the Canadian cannabis beverage industry and now hold 7 of the top10 SKUs in the country. And in the US, of the starting of the Denver Metro area, Truss US has expanded distribution to other distributors and independent retailers across the state, a strong vote of confidence in the joint ventures plan and its brands.
As I said earlier, the results from second quarter demonstrated the revitalization plan is starting to pay off. So we're going to continue investing in our business, in our people and in our communities to continue driving the results we're starting to see. We saw that in the last quarter as we announced two new projects to increase our global hard seltzer production capacity. Canada, we announced plans to quadruple our in-house hard seltzer production capacity, and in the UK, we announced plans to add a new hard seltzer canning line in our Burton Upon Trent Brewery while upgrading our beer and cider packaging facilities to drive efficiencies. Those two investments follow a similar effort last year to increase our hard seltzer production capacity fivefold in the U.S. These investments will have long lasting benefits as we bring more production in-house and ultimately improve our profit margin.
The investments in our business are not stopping there. Finally, after more than a year of pandemic related challenges we're going to be able to more fully invest behind our brands. Now what does that mean while sticking in the UK for a moment, Three Fold Hard Seltzer is backed by the biggest brand investment Molson Coors has ever made into a new UK category. And you can expect to see a boost in our marketing spending over the second half of the year as well. That's for the markets are opening back up, our local alliances reactivating for the first time in over a year and our inventory would have recovered to a point that it makes sense to more fully invest behind the brand marketing.
As important as that is, our success or failure as a company isn't entirely defined by our top line growth. It's also determined in part by how well we support our approximately 17,000 employees and support our hometown communities all around the world. That's why we directly engaged on North American employees in what we call Project Justice, an effort we started last summer and have continued in 2021. Through this initiative, we are supporting 33 organizations across the US and Canada that are working to create a more just and inclusive world. That's also why we're expanding our scholarship program for US college students of color who are pursuing careers in fermentation and brewing sciences as we work to bring more diverse voices to our industry. And that's why we're looking within our organization to improve the representation of women and people of color across the biggest part of our business.
We also just released our annual ESG report Europe, called our imprint with a refreshed strategy that focuses on two key pillars, people and planet. From eliminating plastic rings in the UK to saving over 100 million gallons of water annually through our Golden Brewery modernization project to the significant work we are doing to support our people, we've made great progress against our goals and stay tuned as we continue our ESG journey. We've had our share of challenges over the last several years, but that is changing, and today that sounds also the same thing, Molson Coors' future is bright and the revitalization plan is succeeding. We're de-leveraging our business, we've reinstated the dividend, we're thinking more consciously about how we best support our people in the communities in which we operate, we're investing behind our brands, we are reshaping our portfolio and we're expanding into new spaces.
Nearly two years into our revitalization plan, our results are improving. We're going to put our foot even more firmly on the gas pedal as we drive towards our sustainable top and bottom line growth initiatives for this business.
Tracey?
Tracey Joubert
Thank you, Gavin, and hello, everyone. We posted a strong second quarter which exceeded expectations. We continue to make real progress executing our revitalization plan and we are starting to see the results in our operating performance. As Gavin noted, we continue to premiumize our brands and strengthen our core business, and our improved financial flexibility has enabled us to invest in our business while continuing to deliver our balance sheet and to reinstate a dividend.
Now, let me take you through our quarterly results in more detail and provide an update on our outlook. Consolidated net sales revenue increased 13.7% in constant currency, delivering 98% of second quarter 2019 levels despite continuing to operate with varying degrees of on-premise restrictions. Consolidated financial volumes improved 5.5% uptake in brand volume growth of 3.1% driven by higher Europe volumes and favorable US domestic shipments. Top line performance benefited from on-premise reopenings in the quarter for most of our major markets, as well as strong global net pricing, positive channel mix and historic favorable brand mix levels in the US, as we continue to premiumize our portfolio. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 5% in constant currency, driven by pricing growth coupled with positive brand and channel mix, partially offset by geographic mix, given the strong growth in Europe and Latin America. This top line growth was somewhat offset by inflationary pressures, which impacted most consumer product company as well as increased marketing investments as we continue to execute our revitalization plan.
Underlying cost per hectoliter increased 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by cost inflation including higher freight and packaging costs. However, with robust hedging and cost savings program, we have been able to significantly mitigate much of the inflationary pressures. MG&A in the quarter increased 25.3% on a constant currency basis as we cycle timing shifts and targeted reductions to marketing spend in the prior year period due to the corona virus pandemic. As planned, we significantly increased marketing investments in the quarter, putting strong commercial pressure behind our key innovations and core brands. Underlying EBITDA decreased 1.3% on a constant currency basis, but increased compared to 2019 second quarter levels. Underlying free cash flow was [indiscernible] for the first half of the year, a decrease of $238.2 million from the prior year period. This decrease was wholly driven by letting roughly $500 million in benefits in the prior year related to tax deferrals due to governmental programs and was partially offset by favorable working capital and lower capital spend.
Capital expenditure paid was $212 million for the first half of the year as we continue to invest behind capability programs such as our previously announced Golden Brewery modernization project and our new Montreal brewery. Capital expenditures were lower in the first half of the year compared to the prior year, primarily due to project timing.
Now, let's look at our results by business units. In North America the on-premise channel accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales revenue in the quarter compared to approximately 16% in the same period in 2019. In North America, on premise re-openings vary by market. In the US, our largest market, we continue to see progressive re-openings during the quarter and attained over 80% of 2019 levels as of quarter end. In Latin America, restrictions continue to ease while in Canada significant restrictions continue to act quarter with on-premise volume about one quarter of pre-pandemic level. North American net sales revenue was up 8.3% in constant currency driven by strong net pricing growth, positive brand mix in the US, favorable US shipment timing and higher Latin America volumes. Of note, US net sales revenue exceeded the second quarter of 2019 level.
In the US, domestic shipment volumes increased 1.2% outpacing brand volume declines of 4% as we focused on rebuilding inventory following the first quarter supply disruption. The brand volume declines were entirely due to the economy, which was down double-digits as we deprioritize certain non-core SKUs. Our best premium portfolio was up double digits and our premium brands were up low single digits. In fact, our US above-premium brand volumes reached a record high portion of our portfolio compared to any prior quarter since the creation of the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008.
Canada brand volume declined 5.1% while Latin America brand volumes experienced triple-digit growth, driven by strong core brand performance. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.7% in constant currency with pricing growth delivered across all geographies. The US increased 6.9%, driven by net pricing and historic levels of positive brand mix. While the intension decline in economy was a contributor, about half of this record mixed performance was due to growth in above premium led by innovation brands including Vizzy, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Bella. These positive factors were partially offset by negative geographic mix resulting from the restricted trading environment in the higher revenue Canadian business and strong growth in Latin America. Underlying COGS per hectoliter increased 8.5% driven by inflation, including higher transportation and packaging materials cost and mixed impacts from premiumization. Underlying MG&A increased 24.2% due to higher marketing investments. We increased marketing investment behind core innovation brands and we increased media spending behind our iconic core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite.
Our US media spend approached 2019 levels while local tactical spend was somewhat constrained due to on premise restrictions which eased throughout the quarter. North America underlying EBITDA decreased 10.7% in constant currency, as higher gross profit was more than offset by higher planned MG&A. Europe net sales revenue was up 52.3% in constant currency driven by volume increases and positive channel geographic and brand mix due to on premise progressive reopening, most meaningfully in the UK, given the reduced on premise restrictions compared to nearly full lock down in the prior year quarter. Above premium brand volumes reached a record high portion of our Europe Portfolio. Europe financial volume increased 17.8% and brand volumes increased 15.4% driven by significant increase in UK on premise volume. Net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 16.6% driven by favorable channel geographic and brand mix, particularly from our higher margin on premise both of UK business as well as positive pricing. Underlying EBITDA increased 189% in constant currency driven by gross margin impacts of higher volumes and favorable channel, geographic and brand mix as a result of gradual on premise reopening partially offset by higher MG&A spend.
Turning to the balance sheet, as of June 30, 2021, we had lowered our net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 3.35 times and reduced our net debt to $6.9 billion, down from 3.5 times and $7.5 billion respectively as of the December 31st 2020. We ended the second quarter with strong borrowing capacity, with no outstanding balance on our $1.5 billion US credit facility. Turning to our financial outlook, we are again reaffirming our 2021 annual guidance originally provided on February 11, 2021. While we are taking an evasive place than we were a year ago, it bears reminding that uncertainty as it pertains to the corona virus and its variance remains to varying degrees by market.
Now, I'll provide some underlying expectations to provide some additional context for the balance of the year. We expect to deliver mid-single digit net sales revenue growth for the full year on a constant currency basis. Building off the strong shipment growth in the US in the second quarter, we continue to grow both aggressively to build inventories to more optimal level. In the US we expect on premise trends to continue to improve as we lack restrictions in the prior year period.
In Canada, we are seeing gradual on premise reopenings varying by province, which should provide positive channel mix. In Europe, the UK should benefit from the full on premise reopening in July 19th. However, the comparison is more difficult than it was for the second quarter given the on-premise was largely open for the full third quarter of 2020. Our guidance also anticipates continued strength in our above premium portfolio particularly hard seltzer. Also we expect continued solid progress against our previously discussed emerging growth three-year revenue goal of $1 billion against which we are tracking ahead of plan. We continue to anticipate underlying EBITDA to be roughly flat compared to 2020 as top line growth is expected to be offset by continued cost inflationary headwinds, but more significantly from increased investments to deliver against our revitalization plan.
We intend to increase marketing investments to build on the strength of our core brands and support successful innovations. As a result, we expect significant year-on-year increases in marketing investments over the balance of the year, and most notably in the third quarter. We expect third quarter marketing investments to be higher than the second quarter of 2021 and also higher than the third quarter of 2019 as we continue to ramp up the plan following the disruptions in the first quarter. Obviously, this will have an impact on our bottom line, particularly in the third quarter, but this will strengthen the future of our brands. Also as a reminder in 2020. Our working capital benefited from the deferral of approximately $130 million in tax payments from various government sponsored payment pivotal program related to the corona virus pandemic. We currently anticipate the majority to be paid this year as they become due.
Moving to capital allocation, we continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive top line growth and efficiencies, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. First, we plan to continue to prudently investing brewery modernization and production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives in pre-efficiencies and advance towards our sustainability goals. Second, we have a strong desire to maintain anytime upgrade our investment grade rating. As such, we expect to continue to pay down debt and reaffirm our target net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.25 times by the end of 2021 and below three times by the end of 2022. Demonstrating our commitment to this goal, on July 15th, we announced that we had repaid in full the $1 billion dollars, 2.1% senior notes that were maturing that day using a combination of commercial paper and cash on hand. And third, and also As announced on July 15th, our Board of Directors determine to reinstate a quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common shares indicated quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. The Board made the decision to reinstate the dividend at a level that they believe is sustainable and gives room for future increases as business performance improves.
We are proud of our operational performance in the quarter, which underscores successful execution against our revitalization plan. We are excited about the future of Molson Coors as we drive toward our goal of long-term sustainable revenue and underlying EBITDA growth.
And with that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Ottenstein, Evercore.
Robert Ottenstein
Great, and thank you very much. Gavin, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned so far about the hard seltzer market. Clearly, it seems that there is some issues with beer branded trademarks, but at the same time you've got this proliferation of 700 brands or more then I understand, there is competition from various ready-to-drinks so love to get your thoughts on that. And then, also want to understand why you're not using the Vizzy trademark more in Europe and the UK and that you feel that you need to have different sorts of trademarks there. So a lot of questions, just really love to get your thoughts on what you've learned about hard seltzers and what's going on in that segment. Thank you.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks Robert and good morning. Look, I mean, we've always said that the growth rates weren't going to continue at the elevated levels that were and that others might have seen. You know Robert it is really no surprise to us the stated growth is slow because you know, the category was starting last year huge comps and we've said in the past that seltzers we're a beneficiary of the on-premise shutdown because such distribution exposure in the off-premise and so as the on-premise is reopened and there is less distribution. And so this is not a surprise to us. I think we've been saying this for almost a year. We've also been saying for a while, even if it's growing at 10%, 20%, 40%, there really isn't anything else in the beer space that's growing that quickly. So it's good for the beer category and it's good for us.
In North America, in the US, we've got two very clear and differentiated winners from our point of view and we plan to continue our focus on Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Now you referred to a Coors Seltzer. Robert, I would say to you that Coors Seltzer up in Canada is actually doing really, really well and it's already achieved double-digit share in some retailers and it's between Vizzy and Coors Seltzers probably the most successful product launches that we've had for our company in 5 years up in Canada. We do believe that there will be a shakeout in the near future as many brands struggled to succeed in the crowded space and while Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer continue to accelerate, Coors Hard Seltzer wasn't. And so that's why we made the decision in the US to discontinue Coors seltzer and commit our energy, our resources, the material supply we've got in our shelf space to busy Vizzy and Topo Chico. Of course, it's going to stay in Canada, as I said, it really well the market dynamics are different in the brand has performed well. In Europe, it's exhibiting in the UK and Central Eastern Europe some of the same trends in the early days is the as the US did. And we've obviously tested all of our options from a brand point of view and the early read was that Three Fold was the right brand to go with and it's landed very well. We are building capacity there and I think we're well positioned in the UK to be a strong player if it takes off like it did in the US. And the same applies the Central and Eastern Europe. Why?
Moment was the best brand, resonated really well with the consumers there. The Central Eastern European team do a fantastic job from an execution point of view. So the execution is really good and we actually have first mover advantage in Central and Eastern Europe. So, we feel very good about a leading position in Central and Eastern Europe with that brand as well. I think I hit all your questions Robert, if I didn't, happy to take a follow-up from you.
Robert Ottenstein
Yes, and thank you for that detail. The only other one was how do you look at the interaction between hard seltzers and ready to drinks, there's some observers say that there's really not much interaction. It's the same occasion. I'm not sure I believe that 100%, but love to get your thoughts on the various ready-to-drink concoction that are coming up and how you intend to play in that space going forward as well, I know you're doing a few things there. Thank you.
Gavin Hattersley
Sure, Rob. I mean, yes RTD beverages are emerging, an emerging and fast growing segments in fact RTD sales already outpaced spirits and that gaps I think, going to likely widen in the future. Competing in this space is a natural fit for companies like ourselves who have got experience packaging beverages in 12-ounce cans and bottles and working with our distributor partners to get those products out there. So, we look forward to competing in this category with Proofpoint and we've got Superbird as well, which is the top end of that, which we launched earlier this year, and you know we have other offerings that we believe will appeal to consumers in our innovation pipeline.
Robert Ottenstein
And how much interaction do you see in these ready-to-drink products with hard seltzers or is it too early to say?
Gavin Hattersley
I think it's too early to say, Rob, I mean obviously there is some interaction, it's interesting we've been asked this question as it relates to the beer category and there is more of seltzers volume and growth is coming from outside of the beer category than it's coming from inside the beer category. Our data would suggest that I've seen our competitors, say the same thing and certainly it's been very positive from an overall beer category, beer segment point of view.
Robert Ottenstein
Terrific. Thank you very much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Kirk with MKM Partners.
William Kirk
Hey, thank you for taking the question. So, you talked a bit about the rationale to streamline economy brands, but it also looks like there is some discontinuing of some SKUs for pack sizes on brands like Coors Light and Miller Lite. So can you talk about the decision - I guess to streamline pack sizes as it relates to your efficiency efforts?
Gavin Hattersley
Yes, thanks Bill, and good morning to you as well. Look, we did a thorough review of all of our SKUs and brands. I would say the majority of the SKUs and brand or certainly all the brand reductions, the majority of the SKU reductions are in our economy space. We did identify a few SKUs, which were slow moving and which could be substituted with other more profitable SKUs that would make us more effective and so there would have been just a few outside of the economy space that we rationalized, the vast majority of it is in the economy space.
William Kirk
Got it. And Tracey as a follow-up, I think you said that US brand volume declines were entirely economy. Does that mean excluding the discontinued economy brands that US brand volumes positive or do the remaining economy brands still drag that number into the negative?
Tracey Joubert
No, so the SKU is just recent and so I would say that it's really the prior sort of economy portfolio that is driving that down.
Gavin Hattersley
And Bill Miller Lite and Coors Light in the second quarter as I said, I think in my prepared remarks grew. I haven't done thing I've been able to say that often over the last sort of 15 years or so, and our above premium portfolio did very well as well with the Blue Moon franchise coming back strongly, our craft brands coming back and we're very pleased with our seltzer performance.
William Kirk
Thank you. I appreciate it guys.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Bill.
Operator
Our fourth question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
Lauren Lieberman
Great, thanks. Good morning. Let us talk a little bit more about on premise, and number one, just thinking about brand strategy and portfolio. So, first I was curious about hard seltzer, the degree to which you're trying to expand presence of your brands in on-premise, I think that you had mentioned Vizzy as an on-premise play in Canada, if I got that wrong, I apologize, but I was curious if that was in the thought process for the U.S.? And then, also just I think industry wide discussion of big brands gaining more presence, Staropramen and so on as on premise reopens and I was curious, the degree to which you're starting to see that or been positioning for that to be the case as reopening continues. Thanks.
Gavin Hattersley
Yes, thanks, Lauren. Look, yes during the pandemic, we did see increased demand for large trusted brands and this is particularly true in the on-premise. Many on premise owning sticking to faster moving brands and this obviously benefits brands like Miller Lite and Coors Light, in particular for us and we are seeing that trend stick as we certainly into the sort of new normal. As I said earlier, with Miller Lite and Coors Light we did grow segment share for the 27th quarter. We're also seeing growth in our above-premium portfolio with for example Blue Moon in the US is up nearly 15% in the quarter, Peroni is up nearly 35% and it has provided us an outstanding opportunity to sample our newer offerings, like Blue Moon LightSky and Vizzy and Topo Chico Hard Seltzer which we actually missed that opportunity last year. So certainly, I wouldn't say it's just Vizzy that's going on-premise, I would say both Vizzy and Topo Chico hard seltzer, Topo Chico is as good as well as it's doing, it's in fairly limited number of markets, less than half of the states in the US and in those states it's beyond the desire for it to be on premise has been very, very good.
Canada, obviously little too early to say because the restrictions there have a drag on a little longer than they did in the United States. So, to seem to tell how the Canadian on premise is going to open up. In Europe, it's been very pleasing. As you know, significantly over-indexed to the on-premise. So, the on-premise recovery that's taking place in Europe has been very positive for us. And in fact in July, we've seen the on-premise business in the UK start to approach 2019 levels and hold there; so that has been very encouraging for us.
Lauren Lieberman
And just a follow-up to just clarify, it's within on-premise that's opened, do you believe that you're gaining share within those outlet because of any degree of greater distribution or relative presence within the channel?
Gavin Hattersley
In the US the answer is yes. In the UK the data lags a little bit, so not ready to call that, yes. We have a hypothesis that we are, but I don't have data yet to support that. In Canada, obviously the reopening is not in a place where we can determine that yet, but in our biggest market, the answer to that is yes Lauren.
Lauren Lieberman
Okay, great. And then, the plan is to get to bring Vizzy and Topo Chico hard seltzer on premise in the US and you have the capacity to do that in your plans is that for this year is that more of a looking into 2022?
Gavin Hattersley
Certainly, we have a capacity, with Vizzy we have been able to meet all the demand that our distributors have had with for Vizzy ready since the beginning of the year. Topo Chico obviously is more challenging from a supplier point of view. It continues to perform extremely well. It has only got one SKU, it has got distribution in 16 markets and supply continues to be a little tight, but the production is improving and that is going to allow us to push distribution, which would include the on-premise, but also allows us to start turning our marketing campaign on behind Topo Chico as well Lauren. So, I guess it's a convoluted way of saying, yes.
Lauren Lieberman
Okay, great, thank you so much.

Next question; Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.
Steve Powers
Thank you very much. A couple of questions centered on brand volume dynamics. In Europe, if my numbers are correct, It looks like you're at about 91% of 2019 in the quarter, which is up from the mid-70s last quarter, which is great. And I guess just as you think about the back half, do you think you kind of hold steady at that mid-90s index level or do you think your plan is vision improvement, number one. And as we pivot to North America, you're also at 91% index to '19 in the quarter. But that was down from 94% in the first quarter presumably, as the economy brands were deprioritized, but as we think about the back half, similar question, do you think you'll recover that index to '19 in the back half, number one, and number two, you mentioned that premium and above premium were at the highest percentage of the overall mix you've ever seen. I guess, I'm curious as to whether in absolute terms, those price tiers are - how they compare to where you were in '19 in similar timeframe? Thank you.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Steve. Okay, let me see if I can get all these for you. Look in Europe as I said, actually, and particularly in the UK, as you know on-premise is really important to us and we've actually seen the on-premise approach 2019 levels for the last, well most of July. Actually, it actually spiked a bit higher than that, but that was distorted by the Euro finals. We were actually in the UK where actually for a few weeks quite substantially above 2019 levels. That's settled back down now and as I said we are approaching 2019 levels. Central Eastern Europe is a little being a little bit more impacted by tourism and so we're probably not quite at the UK levels in Central and Eastern Europe, and you know in the US, we've seen, as I think I said on the last call, more outlets opened from an on-premise point of view than we were initially expecting and certainly volume has increased and settled down into a fairly stable level. We will have in the back half of the year, a lot more phase festivals, alliance opportunities which we didn't have in the second half of last year, and I'm referring to football primarily, which is a big drinking occasion for us.
So, without wishing to put particular goals out there we are encouraged by what we're seeing from an on-premise, and then you volume point of point of view, I wasn't totally sure I got your price tiers question Steve said. Let me give it a shot. I mean, we did, as I said, had the strongest share of our of our portfolio being above premium in the second quarter based on an NSR point of view it was up into the high teens level, which we haven't seen levels like that since the joint venture hadn't started, so working particularly well. And in Q2, our NSR was actually above 2019; so encouraging signs for sure.
Steve Powers
Okay. No, that's helpful. If I just put it back to you, it sounds like you do in North America, expect that the total portfolio, not just the on-premise, but the total brand volume portfolio can better approach 2019 levels in the back half versus what we saw in the second quarter, is that a fair playback?
Gavin Hattersley
No, not really, Steve. Because of our decisions around the economy portfolio. Right. So the economy portfolio as we, as I said in my prepared remarks and as we announced to our distributors today, we are taking a meaningful cut on our economy portfolio to rationalize that. So that would be a negative for us. And if you look at our share performance. I think it's our share performance quoted often 70% of that, of that decline in shares is the economy portfolio for us and we paused a lot of SKUs and brands and some of them as we announced today won't come back. So certainly from a premium lac and above premium point of view, which include seltzers we're feeling really good about our position and our momentum.
Steve Powers
Okay, that helps. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.
Kevin Grundy
Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to kind of pull together some of the topics we've discussed so far on the call, kind of bring it back to the revenue and EBITDA guidance, kind of Gavin is you're assessing the first 6 months of the year, looking to the balance of the year and specifically around the major puts and takes. When you spoke at the investment community in June, you said that the company was running ahead of plan, on premise recovery certainly seems to be running ahead of plan and certainly where folks thought perhaps 6 months ago, the performance of your seltzer portfolio similarly also running ahead of plan, commodity environment worse and then it seems like the SKU rationalization, probably has greater pace than you anticipated at the start of the year. So can you kind of pull all this together? I was hoping you could comment on anything perhaps we're missing just put a finer point on the puts and takes as you look back over the past six months how this has progressed your level of confidence for the company as you look to the balance of the year? And then perhaps just confirm given the set up here and the strategy; it sounds like the inclination will be to reinvest any top line upside, if you could just confirm that?
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Kevin. A lot going on there. So I guess the two things, which I would say when we talked to the investment community at Q1 which didn't transpire as we were expecting was Canada, the reopening of the on premise and the continuation of the lock down went on for longer than we were expecting in Canada. And in the UK, we were expecting so called Freedom Day to be back in June, and as you know, that was delayed into July. I would say those are the two things that we didn't know at that time. From a revitalization plan point of view, yes, I mean we are the whole rationale for the revitalization plan is to drive both top line and bottom line growth and the first year was always going to be a reinvestment year, which was supposed to be last year, but we've been through all the reasons why that didn't make sense. And we're certainly reinvesting behind our brands this year, we, increased our marketing spend meaningfully in the second quarter. There were couple of things that didn't make sense for us to do you, like investing meaningful marketing in Canada while it was closed and delaying the UK out a month. So that was probably marketing spend that we would have spent in Q2, which will now move into the back half of the year.
And as Tracey said primarily in Q3, our supply situation has improved meaningfully since the cyber-security attack and our fast moving brands and SKUs with the exception of one or two SKUs or sub-segments, our inventory levels that are higher than they were at the same time last year, which allows us now to really put emphasis behind our brands. And as I said Topo Chico is supply, we worked really well with our partners to increase our supply in the third quarter and beyond. And so that will be coming through, which will allow our marketing teams to really put emphasis behind that. So - and I think I've answered your question, Kevin, but help me if I haven't.
Kevin Grundy
No, thanks Gavin. It's extremely helpful. If I could just squeeze in one quick follow-up with Tracey on the cadence of the margin profile for this company. There's a lot of discussion on the ability for the company to reach pre-pandemic levels as you sort of look at, I understand there is a lot of volatility it's still in the environment, how should investors think about that balancing the need to reinvest and get investment levels back to pre-pandemic levels, but is there any reason to think that over the next couple of years that at the total company level margins should not reach where they were in 2019, and then I'll pass it on.
Tracey Joubert
Yes. And we have not given guidance beyond this year, but as Gavin says the revitalization plan that is about premiumization which obviously comes with higher margin, it is about the cost savings initiatives in our breweries as well as from a G&A point of view, so that should help. Beyond that and we haven't given guidance, but I would just consider those items, specifically related to revitalization.
Kevin Grundy
Very good, I'll leave it there. Thank you. Good luck.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Kevin.
Tracey Joubert

Our next question comes from Nadine Sarwat with Bernstein.
Nadine Sarwat
Yes, good morning everybody. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to zoom in a little bit more on Europe. I mean, so how much of the volume growth that you saw in Europe came from restocking at distributor levels or retailers, especially on trade as you said Freedom Day was meant to be in June, Then it was moved to July, and then any update on the state of the inventories now and how that can help us think of the state in Q3? Thank you.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Nadine. As far as inventory levels, is that a question for Europe or the U.S.?
Nadine Sarwat
Maybe we kick off with Europe and then, that was actually can be my follow-up on the U.S.?
Gavin Hattersley
Okay. Well, look, in Europe we experienced progressive increase as was the strategy reopened as you know it, we have been for outdoor consumption on April 12 then moved indoors on May 17th and then obviously only fully out into Freedom on July 19th. We saw on premise volumes in Q2 average around 70% of pre-pandemic levels, and as I said in July, we've seen on premise really start to approach the 2019 levels. There wasn't one week or two-week buildup of inventory in the on-premise and so I would say that would be more progressive. I mean, frankly, we don't hold big inventories in the UK at all. So it's not going to be a material impact one way or another from an inventory level point of view. And then, for as far as inventories in the U.S. are concerned, look, we said we want it to be in a better place by Memorial Day and we were going to be in a good place by July 4th with our big brands and our fast-moving SKUs and certainly cans was always the big challenge and we delivered what we said we were going to do with cans and on our big brands and large packs and the inventory levels for those SKUs are actually have been and continue to be above the same levels as they were in 2020. So, we're making good progress today.
Nadine Sarwat
Great, that's very helpful. And then if I could you squeeze in one more follow-up, a lot of questions so far Topo Chico. Can you give us any indication as to data you're getting from the consumers, how much of that performance is coming with respect to new trials or repeat buys? Any additional color would be helpful.
Gavin Hattersley
Yes, Nadine. I mean, the demand Topo Chico is incredibly strong, and it's really only got one SKU and we've only got distribution in 16 markets. It's already the number three new item in the segment. It's quickly become a fastest trading seltzer brand in Texas, the number three fastest turning seltzer overall right behind White Claw and Trudy and our supply continues to be tight, but our productions improved that is going to allow us to push distribution and features, our distributors, our retail partners have got strong belief in this brand and we're seeing that from a consumer point of view as well. It's actually a top 10 growth brand in the country and as I said, less than half of the of the states. From a, where is the volume coming from, it's coming from across all of the demographic groups is, no one particular demographic group that dominates and I'm sure it's taking share from some of our competitors, yes, for sure.
Nadine Sarwat
Okay, thank you. I'll turn it over.
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Nadine.

Our next question is from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.
Laurent Grandet
Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. So sets of questions and the first one is really in trying to exhausting their questions from seltzer. You obviously mentioned that Coors seltzer is stopped, but your goal to reach in 10% of this seltzer can be carried by year end. So if you can, the re-provide some color on how to would you bridge the gap from where you are right now to 10% and really on these with the loss of Coors seltzer would you be pushing for Vizzy in the short term to gain more shelf space and how comfortable you are to get that and also, we got seltzer [indiscernible] probably got some more and I would say manufacturing capacity to launch faster Topo Chico to virtually in-house sooner. So wanted to know if this stop has been impacting the time line for Topo Chico to view that we did in-house to be relaunching in more states?
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks Laurent. As far as our 10% share goal is concerned, we, as I said, I think we got two clear and differentiated winners with Vizzy and Topo Chico. With Vizzy we are seeing strong traction with the innovation that we brought, particularly the variety pack to and Vizzy Lemonade. We're seeing with retailers, we've got all three Vizzy SKUs on shelf that we see almost a two third increase in each of those SKUs velocities. And so we're going to continue to fuel Vizzy's momentum we've got more innovation coming. We have had innovation LTOs like a June pride pack, and we've just recently launched Watermelon variety pack. So it's carved out a unique point of difference in the category, and so much so that we're well on our way to becoming the number four spot in the segment despite all the new entrants in 2021. I'm not going to show our hand in terms of which brands are going to take Coors hard seltzer's space, but you can assume that we do have innovation coming on Vizzy and we will utilize Coors hard seltzer space to put that innovation from Vizzy into that space.
And so we feel good about Vizzy, Vizzy will certainly be a big part of getting to our 10 share goal and as will Topo Chico, as I said to Nadine, I am not going to repeat all of that, but it does remain incredibly strong, suppliers improving. We have worked with our third-party suppliers to ramp up their supply and we will go national when we believe we can supply the markets that we're in at this point in time. I mean, our highest high is not quite clear yet on Topo Chico because we haven't been able to supply all the demand in Texas wherever a 10 share. I say other states. we doing equally as well. So, in terms of when are we going to bring it in-house, we've always said we're going to bring it in-house in 2022 that plan is on track. When we do it will improve our margins and it's a slightly different process than perhaps Vizzy as well Coors seltzer. So it's not a direct substitution from a liquid point of view, but certainly from a cans availability point of view, we've got that capacity and it's ready.
Happy to take one more question, I think, operator.

Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.
Sean King
All right, thanks for getting me in here. One question I have is, what was the cadence of depletions from, I guess we heard in the US like a positive mid-single digits back into the back in April to the -4% for the quarter. Any insights, maybe you could provide on what you're seeing in July?
Gavin Hattersley
Thanks, Sean. Look, I mean from a from a second quarter point of view most of decline would have been in the economy space, I mean if you look at our share. I think I said almost approaching 70% of our share loss is economy. It's a very choiceful decision that we've made. It doesn't mean that we don't think all segments matter because we do, we do believe we'll segments matter that we've chosen to ensure that we meet the demands of the largest segment of our consumers at this point in time. So, most of that decline would be driven by the choice we made around economy. As far as volume guidance into the second half, Sean, we don't do that as a matter of principle anymore and I know we used to do it in years past, but we're not going to give that now.
Sean King
All right. It was worth a shot, but I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Gavin Hattersley
