Good morning and welcome to the First Connecticut Bancorp Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After todayâs presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jennifer. Please go ahead.
Jennifer Daukas
Thanks Andrew. Good morning everyone. My name is Jennifer Daukas and I am the Investor Relations Officer here at the Company. Before we begin with our presentation today, weâd like to remind you to read our Safe Harbor advisement and forward-looking statements on our earnings announcements. Forward-looking statements by their nature are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Our comments today are intended to qualify for the Safe Harbor reported by that advisement.
Thank you and now here is John Patrick, our Chairman, President and CEO.
John Patrick
Thanks Jennifer. Good morning everyone and I appreciate everybody taking your time during busy earnings season to come on our call. We are really happy to report solid earnings this quarter, both in earnings perspective but also a continued solid organic growth on the loan side and the deposit side. One of the things that I just wanted to touch on with you a little bit is last quarter I mentioned that we would probably be doing securitization of our mortgage book, during the quarter with shifts in interest rates and some of the volatility when we went to execute the securitization, it didnât make sense from a cost perspective to securitize those loans and put them in the securities line in the balance sheet.
So therefore what we did was, we just did a normal sale of those loans to reduce our concentration of fixed rate assets, mortgage assets on the balance sheet; and also continue to make sure that were assets sensitive in this environment. So nothing materially different from what we had talked about before, except the fact that rather than doing the securitization we [sold] those loans into market, we did retain servicing on that portion of loan that was probably close to about around $85 million -- rough numbers, the execution out of the normal sale that we have on an ongoing basis.
As it relates to our mortgage banking business we continue to have good pipelines in that business, however, we as it relates to balance sheet diversification. We will keep that book relatively flat and in fact probably manage that down a little bit so mortgages become less of a percentage of overall assets and loans on the balance sheet on a go forward basis. Other than that we had good loan and deposit growth for the quarter. Our asset quality remains very strong. We had a little bump up in non-performing assets. It reflects one transaction that we participated with a large regional banking it's in a full workout at this point in time and in fact the NPA has come down pretty significantly since even reporting at the quarter. So we feel pretty good about the outcome on that. Everything else as I said before remains really-really strong.
We're focused on operational efficiency and I think as you can see other than the cost to get our West Springfield operation up and running which are on track with what we said, they were going to be, expenses remain relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. So we're pleased where that's going. Our year-over-year change in ROE, ROA and earnings per share continues to have a nice upward trajectory and as you can see year-over-year we had a very nice increase in tangible book value. So with that I'll just turn over to Greg for a couple of comments that he might have and then we'll open up for questions.
Gregory White
Thanks John, just real quick, there was a little noise in our expenses over the past couple of quarters. So just a reminder that we have a non-GAAP table, which is at the last page of the earnings release where we adjust for the nonrecurring items, and there you see that our earnings were flat quarter-over-quarter on a core basis -- expenses.
Our margin was down a little more than we would like mainly because of the five basis point decline in our loan yield. John mentioned the 85 million of residential that was sold out of portfolio. That was about a basis point contributed by the basis point to that. And then on a commercial side, it's kind of a combination of -- we had some modifications, refinances and origination yields below the existing portfolio yields that led to the decline in loan yield there.
John Patrick
Thanks, again we'll open up for questions for everybody on the call, but we continue to focus and have a missionary zeal relative to growing tangible book value, capital management when appropriate, we do buyback shares when we feel it so it's appropriate to do so and continue to drive operational efficiency. We're very pleased with the initial feedback and reception that we're getting in the western Massachusetts marketplace. We've complimented the commercial lending team up there with a residential lender who is building a team out there as well as open the first branch. The second branch is scheduled to open within the next month, and as I said before a good reception relative to growing our deposits in that marketplace.
We have two offices, will open in early 2016, Vernon Connecticut, Manchester Connecticut. Again extension of the growth that we've had east of the river and that provides us with a solid deposit base. And I think you can see the results of that in our net new accounts on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And the net new checking accounts that we're opening on a quarter-to-quarter basis and year-over-year. I think net new checking accounts year-over-year were well over 5000 without any branches opening. So that gives us the opportunity to cross-selling to that customer base. Those are all new customers to our organization; as we grow and they generate core deposits at the end of the day.
And then last but not least, one of the -- as we continue to build out a more scalable mortgage origination operation; we have opened a small loan production office in Branford Connecticut where we have three share mortgage originators in that marketplace, in existing mortgage brokerage company, quite frankly decided that they didn't want to be doing compliance 90% of the time in originating mortgages 10% of the time. So we got some very talented people in that market. Some of that I've known for over 10 years and have worked with them a prior life as well as here at farming, and they are one of our correspondents.
With that I'll conclude my remarks and again I appreciate everybody being on the call and open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Travis Lan of KBW. Please go ahead.
Travis Lan
Over the $1 million loan sale gain, would you give a sense for what amount was due to the balance sheet repositioning and what amount was just the normal course of operations?
John Patrick
Yes, pretty much the normal -- the normal course we're making about a 1.5%, and that we sold about a 120 million of loans during the quarter. So the 35 may be in the 400,000 there and the rest would be security, the auto portfolio again. Does that make sense or can I gave moreâ¦
Travis Lan
No, thatâs perfect.
John Patrick
But even prospectively, we are looking kind of at 1.5 to 1.75 including servicing on our current production.
Travis Lan
Okay, thatâs helpful. And John with the potential runoff in residential real estate, does that at all impact your kind of prior expectations over that $250 million? I think it was $250 million of net loan growth per year?
John Patrick
Yes, I think that this year we take a look at, although we will hit that number this year as we look at loan growth and probably exceeded that but I think that as we go forward our loan growth is going to be in step and in-lock with our deposit growth also. Travis, we are seeing a little bit of frothiness in certain markets too. So I would anticipate that most of the loan growth from the balance sheet prospective is going to be all commercial as the mortgage banking will just replace one-off, so if you take a look at that I think thatâs where we have been at, itâs been about 150 million, now we have been averaging in commercial growth overall without the mortgage fees of it. So thatâs where we will make an ongoing basis.
Travis Lan
Okay.
John Patrick
If we do more than we anticipate on a deposit side then we will do more on the credit side.
Travis Lan
All right, that make sense. Just quickly on expenses, so excluding the area of recovery, it looks like operating expenses are up about 7% from last year. When you think about the four additional branches that are coming on, what are your expectations for the expensing factor, just expense growth over the next 12 months may be?
John Patrick
Yes, I think we have talked about, we have got that branch cost down pretty significantly, probably about half a million dollars per branch. That expense year-over-year, Travis, thatâs a full year of the team that we have had in what the Massachusetts also, as well as some initial expenses with respect to the branch and the loan production office up there but I think that once they are all up and running, we are probably looking at a $2 million run-rate.
Travis Lan
Okay, all right and then just finally John, could you remind us where you stand with regards to M&A. I know there are obviously limitations given your currency but is there any situation that you can imagine yourself as a buyer in this market?
John Patrick
Yes, never say never, never say always. We take a look at any type of transaction and as that might be in the marketplace and see if it can make sense for us from a tangible book value prospective. As you said based on where our currency is today. I am not going to be out there [indiscernible] or some of the other guys that are out there doing M&A, done a lot of that in the past relative to M&A. So we have enjoyed good organic growth, I think that would continue if there was a transaction out there as there was right transaction, we most certainly able to shareholders to look at it. But thatâs not our major focus as you know.
Travis Lan
Sure. And then just, I mean if you could, you touched on it, what is your own kind of parameters around, I mean if you were to consider a deal tangible book dilution and may be [earned in that period]. Thatâs it.
John Patrick
I donât know. I have to get back to you on that Travis I think, nothing that we've looked at has been beneficial from shareholders that it would have a decent return on tangible book value dilution that was better than our organic growth strategy right now. So again I have to take a look at it, what would have to drive any of these transactions that could be out there that we could participate in and would look at would have to really come on the expense side and I think we have a good discipline relative to eliminating expenses but again I have to get back to you exactly on that because we havenât outline that because there has no part of our strategy.
Gregory White
Travis this is Greg. And just to clarify I want to make sure I answered that properly, basically if you have back out portfolio sales would have been kind in the 400,000 to 500,000 per quarter. That's still a good number at least through the end of the year, a reasonable estimate even though we don't think that a lot of guys says that's not that should be a good number.
Travis Lan
Got it.
Gregory White
I think that's where you're looking for, so I am not sure the math would exactly back in what I said but through the end of the year that's a good number.
Travis Lan
Got it. All right, thank you Greg.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from David Bishop of FIG Partners. Please go ahead.
David Bishop
Hi, good morning gentlemen. Travis, always get good questions in there for me, I have to beat him to the punch. Just a couple follow up questions. I think you said the words, I don't know if thatâs a sloppiness or frothiness in terms of pricing and some of the sub-markets there, does that being said, are you seeing any sort of risk based discipline coming into any of the product segments out there. Obviously I mean this credit cycle is pretty long too, the interest rates are propelling in, but any sense of better pricing along any front out there? Any rays of hope on the pricing?
John Patrick
Not on the pricing front. What I'm more concerned about is on the credit side of things. We've seen some companies starting to stretch a little bit on the credit side. We also think that there are some industries, for example apartments, while goods supply outweighs the demand today. The number of units that are being constructed outweighs demand 15 months from now, 24 months from now. So I do see a little, thatâs where Iâd seen some, I call it frostiness on that credit side and in some industries that, there are sub-segments that are really heavily growing in this market, in the surrounding geographies.
David Bishop
Got it and when in terms of the examiner [indiscernible], clearly it seems the most of these examiners realize commercial real estate as the core product there but any sense that they're starting to get a little bit more of a concern in terms of just the growing concentration I guess within the sector regarding commercial real estate or real estate general?
John Patrick
I think it all depends upon the bank. I haven't seen any additional rate related to the specific regulators. We have a program where we have a pretty robust risk management program where we have outlined our appetite as well as segmentation of our portfolio, stress tested in the variety of different ways which the examiners have always appreciated the way that we've looked at it from that piece of it. So based upon where we have been historically in prior exams, we don't see there any concern coming from that piece of it, unless things have changed dramatically, I haven't necessarily heard that out there.
David Bishop
Got it, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
John Patrick
No problem. Thank you.
Operator
I see a question has just come in from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Laurie Hunsicker
Good morning gentlemen. I'm sorry, I was a little late on the call here I wondered if you could touch on two things and I apologize if you've already hit this but the gain on sale of loans, obviously that was somewhat non-core. Can you talk little bit about how that looks going forward?
John Patrick
Sure, yes Greg good but we'll still hit again.
Gregory White
Yes, Laurieâ¦
Laurie Hunsicker
You know what I can hit it with you off. I can hit it with you offline, I am sorry, earning season I was on another call. I'll catch you offline. On tax rate, I don't know if you talked about that you had a nice drop in the quarter, how should we think about that going forward? Is 27.5 is a good or?
Gregory White
Yes, it is. Generally speaking the more we make the higher our tax rate will go but the offset there, the higher and effective tax rate would be because of our non-taxable income as a smaller percent unless we grow that book which we did. So in other words we put on a lot of tax exempt loans at the beginning of the quarter and that is why our effective tax rate came down.
Laurie Hunsicker
Got it. Okay and then I saw you've added another branch to your list. Do you have a timeline in terms of when the Manchester and the Vernon will open, what month? I mean I know you say first half but just in terms of our modeling?
John Patrick
Yes, I think Vernon will be open first quarter, Manchester maybe open at beginning of second quarter.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay, and is there still an initial drag of about 500,000 or so per year? Is that right?
John Patrick
Yes, that's it.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay, and then I was just looking at the refresh deposit data and in terms of your branches I notice they are going great, I mean your Rocky Hills up at 59 million. I guess the only one that looks so little shy in terms of deposits is the East Hartford branch, at 28 million. How do you think about that? I guess you had said earlier that, random that 25 million is breakeven. How do you think about, where that branch should be or how that plays out going forward?
John Patrick
So if I take a look at the branch of components of each one. East Hartford is in a more of a blue collar community, very diverse community and so what we have there is a probably even though the deposits are a little bit lower from our standings perspective, more transaction accounts there driving more fee income. So from a profitability perspective it actually could be a little bit more profitable for a branch that could have $35 million to $40 million in deposits.
Gregory White
Laura, this is Greg, just back to the tax rate, real quick again. I mean it's good 27.5 through the end of the year but unless our tax exempt income grows proportionately, you will see that tax rate creep up a little bit. And I don't think it's going to grow proportionately, so little higher tax rate next year wouldn't surprise me.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then just touching on share buyback, you guys only did 8000 shares in the quarter. Are you looking at the stock and I mean it looks to me â [indiscernible] back you all are super-super attractive here. How do you think about share buybacks? Is that more because you're sitting in a 9% capital or how do you think about that?
John Patrick
Yes, we will we take a look at and say, what's the best use of that capital. Is it putting out loans or is it buying back shares, and you know as we've told all this before we're going to use a combination of both to manage our capital. We have run that capital down pretty good. And we still believe that the best use of that capital is to grow our balance sheet the way we have been on an organic basis. So again, we will prudently buyback when we believe that the buyback of those shares outweighs the return versus putting a loan on the books.
Laurie Hunsicker
And then just one last question here. Your commercial pipeline, where does that stand?
John Patrick
Yes, we don't really give numbers relative to the pipeline because they move all around but itâs strong, I mean strong, solid, no change. Quarter-to-quarter is pretty consistent.
Laurie Hunsicker
Okay, I mean you had such huge growth in this quarter.
John Patrick
It's consistent, I mean we've got a great team of people that have been here for a while and we have good relationships with our centers of influence and we see a lot of transactions in the marketplace.
Laurie Hunsicker
Thank you, I will follow up with you on the rest I find. Thanks.
Operator
Seeing that there are no other question I would like to turn the conference back over to John Patrick for any closing remarks.
John Patrick
