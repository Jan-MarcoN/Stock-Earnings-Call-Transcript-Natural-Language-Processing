Good day and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Given Imaging Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) All participants are in a listen-only mode.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to David Carey. Please go ahead.
David Carey
Good morning and thank you for joining us. With us today from Given Imaging are Homi Shamir, President and CEO; and Yuval Yanai, Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin I'd like to read the following regarding forward-looking statements. During the course of this conference call the company may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of Given Imaging.
We wish to caution you that such statements reflect only the company's current expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. You are kindly referred to the risk factors and cautionary language contained in the documents that the company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 20-F, filed March 7, 2013. The company undertakes no obligations to update any projections or forward-looking statements in the future.
In today's call the company will make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating expenses. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the company's second quarter 2013 financial results press release, which is available on the Given Imaging website.
I'll now turn the call over to Homi Shamir, President of Given Imaging.
Homi Shamir

Thanks David and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We achieved solid financial results in the second quarter in many aspects including consolidated revenues, PillCam SB sales, cash flow and net income. Record quarterly revenue was driven by strong PillCam SB sales in the EMEA and APAC regions, and the strong growth of our functional GI Diagnostic product in the Americas and EMEA. 
We also reported very strong profitability this quarter due to higher sales and higher gross operating margins. GAAP and non-GAAP net income per share raised $0.16 and $0.22 respectively. Yuval will provide additional financial details shortly.
We are very pleased that we recently achieved a pivotal milestone with clearance to market PillCam COLON in Japan. Screening guidelines in Japan call for everyone over the age of 40 to undergo FOBT. However compliance remains very low and only 25% of the population got tested. After a physician identifies blood in the patientâs stool, just 55% of these patients had colonoscopy to confirm the diagnostic. 
PillCam COLON received a broad indication for use in Japan for diagnostic of colon, colonic disease when colonoscopy is required but difficult to conduct. This also includes patients unwilling or unable to undergo colonoscopy.
We estimate that this represents a market opportunity of approximately 1 million procedures per year. We also believe that this will enable us to expand our presence among Japanese physicians from our customer base stock today of 1,000 GI to potentially 10,000. Reimbursement is expected to become effective in the first half of next year and revenue in Japan should accelerate shortly thereafter. 
We started shipping our next generation PillCam SB capsule, PillCam SB3 to physicians in Europe and Australia in the second quarter. In the U.S. we believed that we are on target to receive PillCam SB3 clearance in the near future. This important milestone will enable us to accelerate our growth in 2014 and beyond. We continue our discussion with the FDA regarding PillCam COLON and we believe that clearance could come during the fourth quarter of this year. 
I will now turn the call over to Yuval for a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results.
 
Yuval Yanai
Thanks Homi. As Homi mentioned we achieved revenues of $49.5 million in second quarter of 2013. Total PillCam SB sales increased to 62,700 capsules in the second quarter of 2013, compared to 59,200 capsules in the same period in 2012. In the Americas region PillCam SB sales in the second quarter decreased by 2% to 36,000 capsules compared to the same period in 2012.
PillCam SB sales in the EMEA region increased 13% to 17,500 capsules, while PillCam SB sales in the APAC region increased by 30% to 9,300 capsules. Worldwide sales of functional diagnostic products increased by 17% to $14.5 million in the second quarter of 2013, compared to $12.2 million in the same period last year. 
In the Americas region, functional diagnostic products revenue increased 17% in the second quarter of 2013 to $11.6 million, compared to $9.9 million in the same period last year. Functional diagnostic revenue in the EMEA region increased by 29% to $2 million while revenue in the APAC region decreased 11% to $800,000. 
Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2013 was 78.3% compared to gross margin of 78.2% in the second quarter of 2012. We are very happy with the continued high level of gross margin, which reflects the favorable product mix as well as our ongoing efforts to reduce cost and improve efficiencies. 
Medical device stocks included in operating expenses were approximately $400,000 or $0.01 per share in the second quarter and $750,000 or $0.02 per share in the first six months of 2013. In the same period last year we did not incur any medical taxes. 
On a GAAP basis operating profit was $5.4 million compared to $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP operating profit was $7.4 compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2012. The solid improvement in operating profit, operating margin is attributable to increased gross profit as well as our global infrastructure which enables us to grow revenues without incurring significant cost. 
We recorded a small finance expense in the second quarter related to currency fluctuation which was offset by currency hedging. Tax expenses were lower this quarter due to credit from prior year tax filings. This was a one-time occurrence and we expect tax expense to return to a level consistent with prior quarter in the future. 
We achieved a strong increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings together with another quarter of strong cash flow. Net income on a GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2013 increased 71% to $5.2 million or $0.16 per share compared to $3 million or $0.10 per share in the same quarter of last year. 
On a non-GAAP basis net income for the second quarter of 2013 increased 40% to $6.9 million or $0.22 per share on the fully diluted basis compared to $4.9 million or $0.16 per share in the second quarter of 2012. We generated $8.8 million in cash from operating activity in second quarter and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $130.3 million and a debt free balance sheet. 
The reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings is available in our second quarter press release which is posted in our website.
Finally I would like to reiterate that we are on target to achieve our 2013 guidance of revenues between $195 million and $205 million and earnings per share of between $0.55 and $0.63 on a GAAP basis and between $0.80 to $0.88 on a non-GAAP basis. 
Moderator you may now open the call to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you, everyone. (Operator Instruction). We will go first to Jeremy Feffer of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Thank you. Good morning guys. Congratulations on the rebound quarter. I guess first wanted to touch on the colon in Japan I just wanted may be a little more color on what your launch preparations are now, are you training sales force? How are you using this time now?
Homi Shamir
Thanks Jeremy. Let me speak about Japan. And first it's going well ahead so far of anticipation which is really a testimony. The Japanese government really see the opportunity to introducing such a technology of the PillCam to the market and I think they are sending a very strong message there. I mean I think it was a record approval for such obvious results. 
Now we have some challenges there and the challenges from our point of view is first we have a big opportunity still in the SB and in the expanded indication as you will recall we received it last year with a very good reimbursement. So we need to maintain our sales force focus and to continue to build that. 
At same times we need to start training them and start building an additional sales force aimed to bring them to the [pictures] and train them in order to take the PillCam COLON opportunity. At the same time we still have to wait to reimbursement. So we are trying to juggle between all those things. And we are planning to start conducting some meeting with our team in Japan and I myself will be there in about two weeks time, with a larger contingency of Given key personnel. 
So we are working all the way out to develop the market but we are not anticipating to sale in Japan before the beginning of the year. So our consideration first in Japan is to build the infrastructure and to build what we needed and start selling in the beginner of next year. Obviously if we get the reimbursement in the first, as we said we anticipate to receive reimburse in the first six months of the year. When we get it we will be ready to start selling the product. 
We also need to make sure that Fuji with our distributors currently to the SB we will nominate them to or somebody else to take the product into the colon market.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay, what Homi, you mentioned the figuring out the sales force increases how many sales reps do you think you might need to add in Japan?
Homi Shamir
I don't want to go through the detail now that because it also depend who is going to be our partner, if it's going to be Fuji or another and that sales will be determined by that and currently we have a 15 sales reps in Japan. We believe that those are enough to carry out on the SB and continue the growth that we enjoy in the SB but obviously the colon will be a big opportunity. 
And I assume that when we come to the guideline -- we saw guideline for the next year which mean in early February next year we will also take to consideration the expense associated with building the sales force and et cetera for 2014. I don't think it will be any effect on us as Yuval said on our earnings for this year, even we hire one or two or three people just to help us in the infrastructure. 
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay. Sticking with colon to, I am wondering Homi or Yuval, any idea on what sales were like in this quarter in Europe this quarter and then what you expect from that going forward over there? Is there any opportunity to build some momentum now that you have Japanese approval and hopefully soon FDA approval?
Homi Shamir
Again we normally don't disclose numbers on Europe but there are not a significant number in Europe mainly due to the reimbursement and which we are working and we have couple clinical plant running there.
I think the biggest opportunity and I keep saying it all along, the biggest opportunity that we have as a company in the colon initially is Japan. It's a big market, bigger than the U.S.A. and with the number of patients that the potential patients. Reimbursement should be a good reimbursement. It should be national reimbursement and it's a very bold indication. 
So that's why we are going to put all our effort and obviously when we get the FDA which I said that we're expecting into be in the during the fourth quarter we will train and work with our sales force in the USA. The only things we need to remember reimbursement in the States will take time to build.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Right. And then last one for me and I'll jump back in queue. Any updates I know you talked a lot at DDW about SmartPill and any efforts to get reimbursement for that? Any updates on that front?
Homi Shamir
We did not receive any, I think I can't remember either before DDW or after DDW we got another 10 million people. SmartPill is performing very well. It's performing actually better than initially we planned.
But we still only 60 or 70, I think 70 million lives on cover. We continue to work on the reimbursement. We also, which we budget for that. We are planning to start a clinical trial not to convince the agency, to convince the insurance company we saw economy here that everybody buy the products.
Jeremy Feffer - Cantor Fitzgerald
Okay. Thank you very much.
Homi Shamir
Thanks Jeremy. 
Operator
(Operator Instructions.) We will go next to Bryan Brokmeier of Maxim Group.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Hi good morning. You had really strong growth in the APAC region. Where was that growth, did you see in strong sales in China and you saw a recovery there, improvement in the performance of your distributor in China or strong sales in Japan or where was the biggest strength and weakness?
Homi Shamir
As the matter of fact it was strong sales in Japan and Australia, not in China. China we maintained, Yuval can look at that, but I think weâre maintained similar level about, like last year, but the growth came from Australia, but mainly from Japan. 
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
So when do you expect China to start to turn around? Any sort of changes at what the distributors' doing and what their strategy has been and any improved training of their sales force that might be able to start to drive that growth as we get into the back half of this year?
Homi Shamir
We are working with them, we are working. We have also some infrastructure there of six or seven people that's working with them in China. I can see it's more an event that we will start seeing -- going back to where we wanted to be in the beginning of the year. I donât think weâll see any effect on Q3 and Q4. I see it more an event that will start from the beginning of the year.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Okay, thanks. Sorry?
Homi Shamir
No, no. Going back to launch phaseâ¦
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
So you launched SB3 in Europe and in Australia, have you seen any increase in utilization by doctors as you kind of expect to be able to see with the launch of the SB3?
Homi Shamir
We got a very -- okay I mean the amount of stuff that we sold is not significant to start seeing how [itâs affecting] account-by-account, okay? But I must say we got a very, very positive comment from physicians who installed this system and start running it both in Australia and in Germany, because we installed it mainly in Germany and Australia. 
I think we need a few more months to assess if itâs really affecting the utilization or the 40% more efficiency. But from the comment we got from the physicians who start using it they really like it. 
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Homi Shamir
And one more thing, for the USA we are planning to start training our sales force for June, September in anticipation that will get approval for SB3 in the near future. So we are getting ready to train our sales force here. We probably would start selling the products in the USA in the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Okay. And as a follow-up on Jeremyâs question earlier on sales of the PillCam COLON in Europe, you had established a target of $6 million in revenues from the PillCam COLON in Europe in 2013. Are you on track to achieve that? Or sort of you said that, they werenât -- sales werenât significant but what sort of level are you going to be able to achieve?
Yuval Yanai

Hi Bryan itâs Yuval. We will not achieve $6 million this year and as a matter of fact this is not in our plan. Yes, we talked about our vision, but it is not in our plan, it's not in our guidance for this year. So we have much lower numbers and I believe that we will try and hit our target for the year by the end of December. 
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Okay, thanks and the last question. Do expect the FDA panel meeting to be scheduled for the PillCam COLON and when we may hear something on that meeting getting scheduled?
Homi Shamir
First I am not aware about the panel. I donât know where you are getting this word. Again FDA can decide what they want to decide and itâs beyond our control. But we went on the de novo. Yes, there is a chance they will not we reach an agreement. They might take it to de novo like any other things, but I donât know, maybe you know better than us.
Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group
Okay, thanks a lot.
