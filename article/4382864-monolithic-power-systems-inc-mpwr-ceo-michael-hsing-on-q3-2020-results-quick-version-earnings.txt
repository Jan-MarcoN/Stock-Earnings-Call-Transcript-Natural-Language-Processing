Bernie Blegen
[00:02:43] Thanks, Gen. MPS achieved record third quarter revenue of two hundred and fifty nine point four dollars million, thirty nine point three percent higher than revenue in the second quarter of twenty twenty and fifty three point seven percent higher than the comparable quarter in twenty nineteen. As noted in our September 14th, 20 20 update to our Q3 financial guidance, our revenue increased beyond expectations for two key reasons. First, we were able to fulfill our customers demand it had been delinquent due to past capacity constraints. Second, certain China based customers requested a previously scheduled shipment. Dates be pulled into the third quarter of twenty twenty. We believe this request was related to trade and regulatory policy changes that occurred during the quarter. These two factors contributed significantly to this quarter's performance relative to the prior quarter of twenty twenty and to Q3 of twenty nineteen. Looking at our revenue by market third quarter Twenty twenty communications revenue of fifty four point seven dollars million was up eighty one point eight percent from the second quarter of twenty twenty, primarily due to a pull in of customers requested ship gates. Communications sales represented twenty one point one percent of our total third quarter twenty twenty revenue and our consumer markets third quarter twenty twenty revenue of seventy point two dollars million increased forty seven point four percent from revenue reported for the prior quarter of twenty twenty. This extraordinary growth in consumer reflects a combination of market share gains in gaming, wearables and Iot applications. Along with normal seasonality. Consumer revenue represented twenty seven point one percent of our third quarter. Twenty twenty revenue. In our computing and storage, in our computing and storage market, third quarter revenue of seventy five point three dollars million increased eleven point two dollars million, or seventeen point five percent from the second quarter of twenty twenty. The sequential quarterly revenue growth was broad based, with sales gains recorded in high end notebooks, servers and storage. Computing and storage revenue represented twenty nine point eight percent of Lopez's third quarter Twenty twenty revenue, third quarter automotive revenue of twenty eight point five dollars million grew ten point seven million dollars, or sixty point four percent over the second quarter of twenty twenty. This improvement reflects a more normal ordering level following the Q2 20 20 industrywide slowdown resulting from the pandemic we believe is market share will continue to expand in the coming years as we have been awarded multiple design wins in infotainment, smart lighting, ADAS and autonomous driving automotive revenue was eleven point eight percent of his total third quarter twenty twenty revenue.
[00:06:06] Third quarter Twenty twenty 20 industrial revenue of thirty point seven dollars million increase. Fifteen point three percent from the second quarter of twenty twenty, due primarily to increased revenue for power sources and industrial meters. Industrial revenue represented eleven point eight percent of our total third quarter. Twenty twenty revenue. Gap gross margin was fifty five point one percent, matching the second quarter of twenty, twenty and ten basis points lower than the third quarter of twenty nineteen, our gap operating income was sixty point zero dollars million, compared to twenty eight point eight dollars million reported in the second quarter of twenty twenty and thirty point eight dollars million reported in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of twenty twenty was fifty five point five percent, 20 basis points below the gross margin reported for the second quarter of twenty, twenty and ten basis points lower than the third quarter from a year ago. Our non gap operating income was eighty four point nine dollars million, compared to fifty three point zero million dollars reported in the prior quarter and fifty one point four million dollars reported in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Let's review our operating expenses. Our gap operating expenses were eighty three point one dollars million in the third quarter of twenty twenty, compared with seventy four point six dollars million in the second quarter of twenty twenty and sixty three point one dollars million in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Our non gap third quarter twenty twenty operating expenses were fifty nine point one dollars million, up from the fifty point seven dollars million we spent in the second quarter of twenty twenty and up from the forty two point five dollars million reported in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. This sequential increase in Q3 and gap operating expenses primarily reflected higher variable costs associated with the increase in revenue and an increased level of investment in securing foundry capacity. The differences between non-GAAP operating expenses and gap operating expenses for the quarter is discussed here are stock compensation, expense and income or a loss on an unfunded deferred compensation plan. For the third quarter of twenty total total stock compensation expense, including approximately seven hundred and seven thousand dollars charged cost of goods sold was twenty three point zero million dollars, compared with twenty one point zero million dollars recorded in the second quarter of twenty twenty. Switching to the bottom line.
[00:09:00] Third quarter, twenty twenty gap net income was fifty five point six dollars million or one dollar and 18 cents per fully diluted share, compared with thirty point two dollars million or sixty four cents per share in the second quarter of twenty twenty and twenty nine point five dollars million or sixty four cents per share in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Huge screen on Gap, net income was seventy nine point four dollars million or one dollar and sixty nine cents per fully diluted share, compared with fifty point six dollars million or one dollar and eight cents per share in the second quarter of twenty twenty and forty nine point five dollars million or one dollar and eight cents per share in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Fully diluted shares at the end of Q3, twenty twenty were forty seven point zero million. Now, let's look at the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments were five hundred and fifty four point five dollars million at the end of the third quarter of twenty twenty, compared to five hundred and fifteen point four dollars million at the end of the second quarter of twenty twenty for the quarter and generated operating cash flow of about seventy seven point four dollars million compared with Q2 Twenty twenty operating cash flow a fifty nine point three dollars million. Third quarter Twenty twenty capital spending totaled nineteen point six dollars million accounts receivable, end of the third quarter of twenty twenty ninety three point five dollars million, representing thirty three days of sales outstanding, which was six days higher than the twenty seven days reported at the end of the second quarter of twenty, twenty and two days higher than the thirty one days at the end of the third quarter of twenty nineteen.
[00:11:05] Are internal inventories at the end of the third quarter of twenty twenty, where one hundred and forty eight point one million dollars down from one hundred and fifty two point one million dollars at the end of the second quarter of twenty, twenty days of inventory of one hundred and sixteen days at the end of the third quarter, twenty, twenty or 50 days lower than at the end of the second quarter of twenty twenty. The sequential drop in days. Inventory on hand represented an anomaly due to a decrease in the dollar value of inventory and a thirty nine percent increase in quarterly revenue. Currently, our inventory levels are linear. We are working very hard to return inventory to the one hundred and eighty to two hundred day level necessary to support our future growth. I would now like to turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty, we are forecasting Q4 revenue in the range of two hundred and eighteen to two hundred and thirty million dollars.
[00:12:10] We also expect the following Yapp gross margin in the range of fifty five point one to fifty seven fifty five point seven percent non-GAAP gross margin in the range of fifty five point four to fifty six point zero percent.Total stock based compensation expense of twenty one point eight dollars million to twenty three point eight dollars million, including approximately seven hundred thousand dollars that would be charged to cost of goods sold. Gap R&D and expenses between eighty one point three dollars million and eighty five point three dollars million non gap R&D and Stena expenses to be in the range of sixty point two million dollars to sixty two point two dollars million, litigation expense should range between one point eight dollars million to two point two dollars million. Interest income is expected to range from one point a million dollars to one point four dollars million, fully diluted shares to be in the range of forty seven point one to forty eight point one million shares. In conclusion, we will monitor market conditions closely and continue to execute on. Now open the webinar up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
A - Genevieve Cunningham
[00:13:35] Thank you, Bernie. Analysts, I would now like to begin our Q&A session as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the participants icon on the menu bar and then click the raise hand button. Our first question comes from Tory Svanberg from Stifel. Tory, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg
[00:13:56] Yes, thank you and congratulations on the billion dollar run rate. First question is Q4 guidance. Could you talk a little about which some of the end markets that's going to be performing in Q4? Obviously, I know communications is going to be down, but what about some of the other markets for the December quarter?
Michael Hsing
[00:14:17] I Torie, thanks for commenting on the billion dollar run rate. Yeah, if you if you compare ourselves against Q3, obviously that was a high watermark. So probably a more relevant comparison is against Q4 of twenty nineteen. And on that basis, we're expecting all of our major markets to be up significantly from the prior year. And then when you do the comparison against Q3, you'll see that they'll probably be declines in communications and computing and also in consumer. The consumer is seasonally adjusted, but we'll still expect to see improvements in industrial automotive.
Tore Svanberg
[00:15:10] Very good. And as my follow up, you mentioned, inventories are pretty lean, so can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're doing to try and get the inventories back up? You said you had some OpEx to maybe secure some foundry capacity, but anything else you can add on sort of how you're going to get back to that hundred and eighty days of inventory? Sure.
Michael Hsing
[00:15:33] I think as we acknowledged in Q3, that we were able to catch up as far as having adequate capacity in order to service near-term demand and in giving guidance for Q4. That expectation follows along when we look ahead over the course of the next 24 months. We previously mentioned that we're entering into new relationships with other fabs and expect to grow our overall capacity. So this will be an ongoing investment that we would project for at least about the next six quarters.
Tore Svanberg
[00:16:18] Great, thank you and congratulations again. Thanks Tore.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:16:23] The next question comes from David Williams from Leupp Capital. David, your line is now open.
[00:16:41] I can hear me. Yes, David, I can.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:16:44] I think there's a mistake. It's Wilstein from. How are you? I guess I'll just go first. A clarification. The inventory that the inventory target that you called out in your script, I think you said one hundred eighty two hundred. I think that's 20 days higher than what you said on the last conference call. Is that correct?
Michael Hsing
[00:17:07] And if so, can you help us understand what's changed the previous metrics that we had been using? We're about 20 days lower that we really made this change as far as what we've been trying to explain to the analysts and to investors over the course of about the last two to three quarters. But nonetheless, what I do want to address your question, which is in order for us to sustain the level of growth that we have in excess of our market, the industry, that we have to have a higher level of inventory. So in other words, there's a mismatch. In other words, we are building the inventory today, but we're not going to for the sales that will occur one or two quarters out. And so it's not a perfect reflection for for other companies where they're not growing as fast. They can maintain lower levels in terms of days. But here again, we have to make an incremental investment in order to allow to support our growth.
Bernie Blegen
[00:18:20] Let me add it as you remember it and of the last years. And we're at around 200 days of of inventory if we use that model and to meet that this year gross. Now, probably that's about the right numbers. That's well, that's the basis we that's the way to where this 20 more days come from. And so if you go to a little more little more details and. NPF says it's a fabulous company, and yet we have our own technologies. This is a very unique. I can't think of any any of our competitors. They have the same way of a manufacturing and do them to fulfill their manufacturing. Most of them have their own fab. And so given the volatility and also given the growth that we that we have and also a number of the product and address the ordeal of growing greenfield greenfield market segment, we need probably a more than two hundred days inventoried.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:19:53] Ok, that that helps a lot, if I can have one quick follow up, the guidance, while great overall on revenue and EPS, the margins are a little bit different from what maybe some would have expected. And Bernie, I'm just wondering if you can tell us if the model we should be thinking about, which historically was that gross would grow at 10 to 20 pips quarter and margin? You know, there was a I guess, a change in that view that perhaps we wouldn't get any operating margin leverage for the next year or two. Maybe you could just update us on that on that model for both those lines. Sure.
Bernie Blegen
[00:20:34] And I think that you captured it very well is that obviously our model has been to improve gross margin, 10 to 20 basis points sequentially. Now, a lot of factors weigh into being able to deliver against those results, including both our mix of business as well as what the market looks like. So, again, you have to use these as guidelines, not as an absolute guarantee of what our performance will look like. And then on the operating expenses right now, we are going to be continuing to invest in capacity, as I said, in each of the next six quarters. So that will be an additional layer of investment from what we've seen. And so as a result, we're not projecting our operating margins to improve significantly over the course of the next two years.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:21:35] Or OpEx, I think is is that right? In other words, op margin would just expand with gross, which is 10 to 20 bucks a quarter or great. Thanks, Bernie. I'll get I'll get back and thank you again. Thanks.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:21:53] Our next question comes from David Williams from the capital. David, your line is now open. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham.
Quinn Bolton
[00:22:09] When your line is now open, hey, guys, the offer, my congratulations on a very strong September and good December outlook. Bernie and Michael, you know, these are sort of unprecedented times in the business. And I know you don't typically look out more than a quarter, but I guess one of the questions I'm hearing from investors is whether there's any sort of inflated demand still impacting the business into December quarter and wondering, you know, to the extent you can give us any sort of thoughts on March, would March show a typical seasonal decline from the December quarter of, say, you know, three to five percent, what you would see in a typical year? Or do you think it could show, you know, a greater seasonal factor? I know you don't typically go out of quarters, but again, this is, you know, really strong results here in the near term.
Bernie Blegen
[00:23:06] Let me answer that question, look, if you're talking about normal seasonality, then the outlook is great. And we have we have so many design activities and we have so many award projects and they came in and in the butt. And as well, as you know as well as I know, this is we're in the process of the error and pandemics and geopolitical issues. And they and I can't predict and frankly, I care less.
Michael Hsing
[00:23:49] If I could just add to that is that I really think that there's certain aspects of our business that we have in good control as Michael hit on as far as the design wind activity, that right now we do not have control over what the end customer demand is ultimately going to be viable. So I think that as far as executing against our strategy and seeing it show up in our results, I think we're going to continue along that path. But there are just too many factors for us. It would be pure speculation at this point.
Quinn Bolton
[00:24:27] Ok, maybe I could ask in past calls, you've oftentimes given us some idea of your first starting backlog coverage. And I know that typically runs a very high percentage of the revenue guidance. My guess is, you know, with some of the delinquencies you had in the past quarter, you had very strong backlog. But as you head into the December quarter backlog, sort of back to more normal levels that it would have, you know, typically run in the last couple of years, is it, you know, still elevated? Can you give us any thoughts on kind of the backlog coverage?
Michael Hsing
[00:25:04] Well, other December callers now go into a December quarter, we're still facing delinquencies, so the capacity is still limited. And I think what we're seeing here is that, as I said in the guidance that we offered is it anticipates both the demand, including the backlog that we had coming into the quarter, and it's matched with what our supply chain and capacity limits are. So I guess that I would probably offer that we have some ability for upside, but it's going to be a little bit limited by, you know, supply chain.
Quinn Bolton
[00:25:50] Ok, great, thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:25:54] Our next question comes from Alex Specky from William Blair. Alex, your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:26:01] And Michael and Bernie, congratulations again, and in a very volatile environment, if we can just touch base a little more on the automotive segment, this appears to be the highest revenue quarter you guys have posted since really starting to gain traction in the segment. I realize the environment's just starting now to get a little bit better. But can you maybe update us on how we should think about the long term growth targets there? In the past, you've said, you know, 40 to 60 percent growth. Obviously, that may be a little premature at this point. But the perhaps update us on how you're feeling on that segment.
Michael Hsing
[00:26:41] Yeah, I would probably say that automotive is one of the more exciting end markets for us for the next several years. Now, if you look at our track record in twenty nineteen and twenty, twenty, twenty nineteen was affected by the recession twenty twenty by factory closings related to the covid-19 pandemic. So, again, those are circumstances that were largely outside of our control. But what we're seeing is, is that we're expanding now. We're from our traditional infotainment base into some of these more exciting technologies, including the lighting systems, the radar and the autonomous driving. So we think that this is a sustainable revenue growth should be well ahead of what our corporate average is going to be. At one time, we were promoting the concept of being able to grow consistently at 20 to 60 percent per year. But I would probably back off of that down to a more reasonable, you know, between 30 and 40 percent, but still very exciting and market for us.
Bernie Blegen
[00:27:59] So that's a you have been kind of talking. OK. I frankly, we don't have I don't have a clear picture. And what's the growth of frankly, I never put it NPS as a as a as a oh, we have to grow a certain percentage. Okay. And what I'm looking at is a which, what kind of product, which project and how well we're positioned and which, which customers, which projects the we want designing and more importantly what kind of products that are in the pipeline that really drives the pipeline. And so how do we, how do we predict and what's the next what's the gross percentage.
Michael Hsing
[00:28:57] I can I can tell you.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:29:01] No, no, that's fair, but it's good to hear that the trajectory seems to be sort of back on track and then similarly, I don't I don't think I don't think in the in the prepared comments, you guys commented on the extent of the into Q3. Is it fair to say that the vast majority of the sequential decline in Q4 is related to the pull in activities, or is there also a little bit of normalization of demand in there as well?
Michael Hsing
[00:29:32] Well, we had a lot of pulling from Q3 and the partial partially in being Q4. And while still as a said, as I said earlier, we're still facing delinquencies. And so I think that's a combination of the gross and the and also in the in the in a capacity shortage. So for me, if I'm get past, could that pass.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:30:04] OK, and then lastly, if I can just done the day's inventory, one hundred and eighty to two hundred days, how long will it take you to get back to that level? Is that something you can achieve when you are we really looking to more of the first half of twenty twenty one?
Michael Hsing
[00:30:21] Well, if the market slows down, we're going to get there quickly. I think that again, we again look and this is we're at the uncomfortable levels. And so we want to increase as much as much as we can. And now our engineers and the working of working at a different fabs and and to get to qualify the the process and the technologies and the. So we hope and in the next six months that we can we can catch up.
Unidentified Analyst
[00:31:12] Ok, great, I'll go back into you, thank you so much.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:31:18] Our next question comes from Joshua Buckhalter from Cohon. Joshua, your line is now open.
Joshua Buchalter
[00:31:24] Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Let me echo my congrats is for my first question. Earlier this year, you mentioned bringing an additional 12 inch fab online in the second half. So I was wondering, was this the primary driver of the additional capacity you were able to secure in the third quarter? And then looking ahead, to how much more capacity do you feel you need to both serve your customers and get the inventory levels up to that, that you raised? One hundred and eighty to two hundred days?
Michael Hsing
[00:31:54] Yes, OK. The first question was a yes, absolutely. OK, we we said in an earlier earlier this year we expect another 12 each fab. But whether it was in our plant, the first we hurry and we hurry up and get up and go and look and we start shipping product in Q3. Okay, that's a that's a very, very that's an unprecedented and the thanks to our our peoples. And they really walked in the day and a night to manage that and to manage and the qualified that these products going forward. We just want to expand our capacity to reach the 180 to 200 days human trade and going in the future, if you have a very linear world, I came within very easy to calculate, OK, I think we're living in the very nonlinear environment and 200 days inventories. And that's what we want to do.
Joshua Buchalter
[00:33:12] God, thank you, that's very helpful. And then my follow up is a bit of a bigger picture question. I mean, you guys are now a billion dollar or you reach a billion dollar run rate this quarter. Are you seeing any increased or changes in the competitive responses from your peers as you move higher up with a unit basis and as well in the socket value? Thank you.
Michael Hsing
[00:33:37] Our ASP is increasing and as when we move to a higher market segment and. So that's our competition competitions, always pretty similar to like me and our customer doesn't even know impious is a billion dollars. They all know that because it's very small potatoes against all these giant. But I think you go back to when our competitive basis is. It really is, is that we're winning with superior technology and a higher level of customer service. And I think that's what our customers are recognizing this for.
Joshua Buchalter
[00:34:19] That's right. Yeah. All right. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.
Michael Hsing
[00:34:22] Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:34:25] Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Rick Schafer
[00:34:32] I thanks you guys and I'll add my congratulations as well. Maybe just a quick follow on follow on, if I can, on that production question. I know you guys have been pulling in the production and foundry partners pretty aggressively. I mean, I know you've spoken, I think, in the past about sort of once it's done, the goal is to kind of be at that one point, two billion or so and kind of annual revenues. And that's not a lot of headroom for you guys at your current run rate, at your current growth rate. So I'm curious, you know, is that one point to still rate, right? No. We should be thinking of in terms of your capacity when all is said and done and maybe what does the timeline look like for that now since you're such a pawn stuff in.
Michael Hsing
[00:35:15] Yeah, OK. The obvious one point to me is not it's not enough to look at and if you want to be adding a fast banana to 200 units or always more than double it now, and that's what we try to do. And in the end, it's not easy. And that's why we end any for just a Doublemint.
Rick Schafer
[00:35:41] And I think that in the past, you know, securing fab capacity and being able to introduce new products at the rate that we are is really nothing new to us. But the scale has been getting bigger. And so that's why the Double mint investments and the time that we have to plan ahead makes a difference. And so all we're doing is preparing both for the capacity, but also recognizing technology and the investment that goes with it.
Michael Hsing
[00:36:14] So if we fast forward 18 months, 24 months, I mean, is there a bogey for what we use where you think your capacity will be? I mean, if it's not one, two, is it is it is it I assume higher than that. [00:36:25] But I just was curious if there was a number you can share or if, you know, at this point all we're doing I'm sorry, I wasn't set clear. We're shooting for two to Billabong's to gain. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.
Rick Schafer
[00:36:37] So thanks, Michael. And then just maybe a question, if I could, on 5G. And, you know, maybe I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your exposure to the tier one. You know, 5G ran OEM, the one that you're allowed to sell to. Of course, you know where you are in terms of of revenue ramp or design win activity. I mean, are are any of these guys buying Kosmaj yet or are you sort of initially seeing more, you know, PLL issues kind of, you know, similar to what you saw in the early stages of your your cloud server?
Michael Hsing
[00:37:08] Well, I think there's a five that overall, as at the early stage and the and the all I can say now and and now, the way engage with all of the 5G station makers and we do have a designing activity and we do have award projects and and the but is not significant revenue yet.
Rick Schafer
[00:37:36] Thanks, Michael.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:37:39] Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Ross, your line is now open.
Ross Seymore
[00:37:45] I guys want to give the same congrats that everybody else did stupendous work here, a couple of quick questions. First, when do you expect the delinquencies to be gone?
Michael Hsing
[00:37:57] If the market slows down, so we're going to do that next quarter, but if the demand is still that strong, we continue to face that and we see some of that not as bad as last quarters, the last two quarters.
Ross Seymore
[00:38:20] And then on the supply side of the equation, somewhat, but maybe even a bit more of a regulatory issue, what's the exposure and how are you dealing with the highway ban? And does the SMIKE ban have any impact on you, whether it's on the supply side or otherwise?
Michael Hsing
[00:38:37] Well, why was it not our customer? I was I was not our supplier some OK, but smic Zork. It is our Zorch suppliers and that came in so far as not, not affecting us and we don't know, we can't speculating. Ok, what does, what does all these policy means that came in. But on the other hand and we diversified our, our resources, OK, we're starting from the beginning of this year so we speeded up.
Ross Seymore
[00:39:17] So on the walkway side, just to be clear, you had them as a customer, I believe, in the first half of the year, one way or the other, and I assume you're no longer shipping to them. And I just wondered if that's part of your fourth quarter guidance. Is them going to zero?
Michael Hsing
[00:39:31] Well, we can't say it is zero or all of non-zero and came in and it's so far off the mark and we cannot ship. And but there is a other rules and regulations coming out and all the other permits came in. We can speculating on what an kind of things we can do to make and is all depend on the government now.

[00:40:06] I mean, I guess the last question then away from government type questions is, Bernie, you and Michael have had a framework in for many, many years about the percentage superior growth versus the analog market that you guys have delivered. I think it's been kind of a 10 to 15 percent positive delta in your favor. Is that rule just thrown out the window now? This year is, you know, 25, 30 points above that peer group. And I know one year doesn't make a trend. But as you look at it, is there something that's creating some semblance of escape velocity where that delta expands meaningfully just due to the breadth of your design, wins the market you're targeting? Or do we expect a little bit of reversion to the mean in 2021 after such a great twenty twenty?
Bernie Blegen
[00:40:52] Well, you know, I can't. And as I said, the war is not linear. So I came in and I remember and I was facing a lot of I was a face I was facing a lot of questions about when our model will be our model is like a twenty to twenty five percent growth rate in 2016 17 of 2015 16. And we will criticize a user would never get that. And although we're somewhere around the 17, 18 percent mark. And so and you ask this so many times, are you forced me to say it at the time that I think I'll run in 2016? I said that by 2018 19. So we're going to get it over over over 20 percent. Ok, and and upholding that comment is holding off on for my for my hair, OK?And I don't have a business. I stuck me in that in the nonlinear word, the like. I mean, it's very difficult to predict. And so I said earlier and I came we only anticipating this and I came in by stuffing inventories and looking in by stocked inventories and just get ready. And of course, and the world crashes. Okay. Of course, we're not we're accustomed to depleting inventories and we're not building of them as as many as much. And so we can modulate the inside a little bit. OK, but for the growth rate I see look at all these designing activities and all the other projects I was this last couple of years is better than two or three years before. And we're awarded a lot more high value products, high value sockets.
Ross Seymore
[00:43:14] That's great. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:43:19] Our next question comes from Tory Svanberg from Stifel. Tory, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg
[00:43:25] Yes, thank you. I just had a follow up, Michael, on e-commerce. That's obviously a business model that could, you know, help you, you know, manage capacity, inventory and so on and so forth. Have you been able to keep up with the investments there in this environment? Maybe you could just update us on where the e-commerce business stands today.
Michael Hsing
[00:43:47] I we didn't prepare the numbers and I think that were doing really good and I thought that there was nobody going to ask a question. We have so much other news. It is OK. I think so. We I can't I feel I can say it. We figure out the way to do it and so on until we prove ourselves the wrong against the. The new website, I think, as you see it, it's a very different and we increase a whole lot more clicks and the customers stay on the pages for a lot longer. And also, we were creating a view, creating a virtual labs. And that part of it also helps also help the e-commerce. So we don't have the pull out phase and have them pump pounding the pavement and the to to generate enough to generate a lot of opportunities. And we using the website and the numbers and the increase by increase weekly and a very pleased day. And, and so I to talk about a few hundred percentage increase from a small number, it doesn't mean a lot but. Force and the wind limit, that's the trade, that's the area we're going to do OK. Are we going to enhance that? I even go that there's an even higher arching strategy here where e-commerce is a significant part of it. And it's really how do you go after underserved customers? And what was surprising to me is we did a look at the last three years as far as how many customers did we have that were under a hundred thousand dollars? And how is that base growing? Because if you can use the linear model where what they used to do is get in there early, then the technology and technology get in there early and then develop these long term relationships and then you grow with their growth. And so is a part of that strategy. I think I think the numbers I looked at, we're doing a very good job. They're starting their dividends will increase than these. And then about three or four times. Yeah. And Thomas from a small base. And in that that is a significant in that it's happening in the last few years. And now clearly we can. We can put a metrics and so on, say it is what you measure, what you get. And we know how far to know how to want to measure it. And that's, to me is a very important. But look at the revenue wise. OK. It's become meaningful, but I don't have a clear detail, so I don't want to have her pull a pull on my hair.
Tore Svanberg
[00:47:19] No, that's great. Thank you very much, Michael. And very.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:47:26] Our next question comes from Rick Schafer from Oppenheimer. Rick, your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg
[00:47:32] Yes, thanks, Michael Bernie. And speaking of things that haven't been talked about as much maybe the last couple of quarters, I'm curious if you could give us an update on the design win pipeline or revenue color for your converter business. You know, has I'm just curious, as Machsom, you know, opened any doors for you guys. And have you seen the level of engagement with customers increase, you know, maybe as a side note or are you seeing more analog? You know, there's an engineer resume's or is it easier to find guys? So I'm just curious if you give us any update there. Thanks.
Michael Hsing
[00:48:08] Is finding good people is always hard. All these are good companies to keep the good people, and that's always that's always a challenge. And so we know that we need a diversify. And that came in a lot of times in the last 10, 15 years and or more or more likely the last 20 years. We have a lot of people from China and came in and now to four or five years ago. We migrate to Europe then. And the ones and the outside of the mainland China now and the last couple of years, they will come back to us. And we do see in the not necessarily in the in the in a Bay Area, but other Pacific countries. And we do find some targets there.
Tore Svanberg
[00:49:06] And Michael, any update on what's happening with convertors for you guys? The computers, which is the signature stuff, the team you brought in, I think it's been a couple of quarters since we talked about it in eight hours. Oh, it high performance analog. Yeah.
Michael Hsing
[00:49:26] Oh yeah. The data converters. OK, yeah. Yeah. Yeah I, I think we received the first post chip. OK, and this is prototyping. Yeah. And I think is the word Budinger solutions and the as a as a as a most of the time the, the first chip will have some bugs again, but it is a wiggly and w we are building a prototype. We still can put in a system. No.
Tore Svanberg
[00:50:02] Got it. Thanks, guys.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:50:05] Our next question comes from William Stein of Chouest. William, your line is now open.
William Stein
[00:50:10] Thanks. Follow up from before. We're just someone else asked about e-commerce, but I'm hoping you might give us an update on the emotion and module business and maybe the programable traction. Generally, I think about these are sort of separate from e-commerce. Maybe they're not as separate, but an update on this part of it would be really helpful. Thank you.
Michael Hsing
[00:50:39] Yeah. So I think we use the e-commerce platform to promote those products to emotional side. I think the revenues. I had to say something, but now otherwise I don't know what you guys think of what I do have a members I want to have a like some kind of support is increased to almost double it. The the models, the emotion, the emotion is right in that sort of transition phase because we have a lot of design wins going in. So last year, the revenue run rate was somewhere in the 10 to 12 million. But now the doubling is going to start, particularly as we go into both automotive and industrial applications. Yes. So I was I'm correct, yes, I was about to knock and I think also when we look at the module's business that is taking on very nicely, I think the more you start over with the smaller base, like a few hundred percent increase, and that is a 40, 30, 40 minute.
William Stein
[00:51:54] Yeah, that was that is the strength that you're seeing there at all related to the pull ins and, you know, delivering against delinquencies that you had previously, or is this part of the rest of the business? What I want to think of as core that might not have.
Michael Hsing
[00:52:13] No, it's not. It's a small part of it is due to delinquency. And that came in and this is a new market segment and people from all of them aligned and we never went up. See those like me in an hour, if it's not our only Internet and their own website and look at from our distributors. And these are very small customers, they never order those before. And that's although the numbers are small, but the revenue is too small. But the large number of our customers in and they use all these are putting play modules and. So what we and they can just plugging in and they don't have to do any designed and those things you mentioned the they've been pushing it. That's portable. We learned that our custom doesn't even want to do programs like they want us to do it. OK. And So, so we created a virtual labs and we custom told tell us what So, they want to wanted and we shall wait in our labs, OK? We program everything and then we ship it's. So now you can talking about it. It's a really a custom designed for each customer comes in and that is taking off and I'm very glad to see it.
Bernie Blegen
[00:53:55] And just a final comment there is on the modules. They're not necessarily tied to anyone in market. They're actually very broad based. Initially, we thought that they would be plug and play solutions, particularly for prototyping or small volumes. But it turns out that they're actually going to make things mainstream production.
Michael Hsing
[00:54:18] Yes. Yes. And so that's something we learn to like. And I'm a former engineer, OK? I'm a school engineer. So I'm like our people and we create these great products that we see it. And that gave me and we're pointing like a floaty parameters. So many parameters on the website. They can program and they can see what the result from the simulations and the and the turn out to be is OK. And the way we put all on and nobody looking at it and wondering what it was. And so we reduced to half and then we had another half the reduced to five, six, seven. They still don't want to see it. And they want to they want if they want to pick the numbers. And in the part of you, you do that for me, OK? And that's great. We can do the works and they pay for it.
William Stein
[00:55:15] That's fine. OK. That's great detail and progress. Thanks very much.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:55:23] Our next question comes from Kevin Bolton, from Needham Quinn. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton
[00:55:28] You guys just wanted to see if you might be able to give us an update on your efforts in the new space for either just top or data center. You say, you know, just looking at power consumption of those devices, I think you're seeing desktop CPU's now consuming up to 300 watts. I think data center maybe up to 400 watts. You guys, I think it talked about that back in the analyst days as a potential opportunity. Just wondering if you're starting to see, you know, any real traction or if you start to get near the curve on either the sort of the gaming or the data center side of GPS.
Michael Hsing
[00:56:05] Yes, we're seeing substantial movement on both. We probably started out earlier on the desktop when we started generating revenues with this about 18 months to two years ago. And now we're moving into the data center where we actually are starting to ramp and in particular 48 volt for artificial intelligence. So the opportunities are significant, but we're still at the very early stages of this market. So fundamentally, we're very well-positioned. But it's still going to be, you know, another year or two before we still move the dial with the revenue ramp. Those are appointees talking about these are over a thousand layoffs and in about two or three or four hundred levels. And if you get to that higher level, you're only talking about only a few companies that can supply that those type of products. And I think we are in a good position and but always can be better. Great. Thank you.
Genevieve Cunningham
[00:57:21] If there are any follow up questions, please click the raised hand button. There appear to be no further questions. I would now like to turn the webinar back over to Bernie.
Bernie Blegen
[00:57:35] Great. Thanks, Jim. I'd like to thank you all for joining us for this conference and look forward to talking to you again about our fourth quarter results, which would likely be in early February. Thank you. And have a nice day.
