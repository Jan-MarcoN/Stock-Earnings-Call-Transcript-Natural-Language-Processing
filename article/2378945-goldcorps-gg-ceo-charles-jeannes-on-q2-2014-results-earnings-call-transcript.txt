Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck Jeannes, President and CEO.
Charles A. Jeannes
Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're coming to you from Ottawa, where we've just concluded our quarterly board meeting. As the largest gold producer in Canada, maintaining a presence in our capital city is important and our time this week has included meetings with representatives from government, business and education as we continue to grow our partnerships.
Ottawa makes for a great backdrop as we deliver news of an excellent quarter for Goldcorp. Gold production totaled approximately 650,000 ounces at very low all-in sustaining costs of $852 per ounce. Adjusted revenues were $1.1 billion, with adjusted net earnings of $164 million and strong operating cash flow of $376 million.
We saw strong results across the portfolio, but the contribution of PeÃ±asquito really deserves special mention. Increased throughput, increased grades and recoveries, drove very strong production at record low all-in sustaining costs. Our operating for excellence initiatives are delivering significant efficiencies and we expect to see continued favorable bottom line impacts in future quarters.
Now, it's difficult to upstage such a good performance from PeÃ±asquito, but last Friday's announcement of first gold at Cerro Negro was a celebrated and important milestone for Goldcorp and the Cerro Negro team. Those of you who followed us on this project's journey from the start of construction over 3 years ago will appreciate the team's accomplishment in the face of sometimes challenging circumstances. We've reconfirmed 2014 gold production guidance at Cerro Negro of between 130,000 and 180,000 ounces and we expect this mine to deliver significant value over a long mine life.
The startup of Cerro Negro also signals the beginning of a new phase of growth for Goldcorp. The ÃlÃ©onore project remains on track to commence production in the fourth quarter. At Cochenour, we continue to expect first production from development ore late this year and regular production in the third quarter of 2015. This production growth and lower costs will help anchor a sustained period of increasing margins and free cash flow.
We will continue to be disciplined and opportunistic with respect to M&A. For Goldcorp, M&A has always meant more than just acquiring good assets at the right price. Divesting noncore assets has long played and equally important role within the company as we constantly seek to upgrade the overall quality of our asset portfolio. Those efforts have unlocked approximately $5 billion of additional value for our shareholders over the past several years, including the second quarter divestiture of the Marigold mine for cash proceeds of $180 million to our account.
With respect to guidance, we were pleased to confirm this morning that we're on track to meet our 2014 production guidance of between 2.95 million and 3.1 million ounces this year. With 2 quarters of low all-in sustaining costs to start the year, we're tracking toward the low end of our all-in sustaining cost guidance range of between $950 and $1,000 an ounce.
For the second half of 2014, while our unit cost improvements at the mines are expected to continue, our all-in sustaining costs will increase as a result of higher sustaining capital, compared to the first half of the year. And of course, over the long-term, our costs year-on-year are trending down, as we bring on the new low-cost production and continue to see cost savings from our operating for excellence initiatives.
With respect to our new project capital spending, we have reduced the capital spending range at Cerro Negro by $100 million to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. And this has resulted in our overall guidance range narrowing to between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion from our previous guidance of between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. Russell will have more details on Cerro Negro in a moment.
Looking further out, our 5-year production guidance also remains on track with our solid foundation of existing low-cost gold production and an infusion of new low-cost growth now underway, we're well positioned to achieve our plan. We will continue to advance numerous organic growth opportunities as well, including Camino Rojo, the PeÃ±asquito CEP and Pyrite Leach programs plus the deep skarn potential there, the Los Filos expansion and the new HG Young discovery at Red Lake that George will talk about in a minute.
So as we near the completion of our major capital spending program, we still expect to deliver free cash flow before dividends paid in the fourth quarter of this year, with significantly increasing free cash flows expected in 2015 and beyond. With growing production driven by our new low-cost mines, an investment grade balance sheet, and excellent organic growth projects, we believe we will be delivering strong shareholder value for many years to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to George.
George R. Burns
Thanks, Chuck. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter across the mine portfolio, with gold production of 648,700 ounces at low all-in sustaining cost of $852 per ounce. Most mines met or exceeded plan with the exception of Los Filos, where we suspended operations for about 6 weeks until we negotiated settlement with Ejido.
A new 5-year land occupancy agreement provides stability as we return to full production. Another quarter of low all-in sustaining costs were driven by reduced operating costs as a result of our continued success of our operating for excellence program. Additionally, as expected, we will see higher sustaining capital expenditures in the second half of 2014.
One source of significant cost savings has been our supply chain management. Back at our Investor Day in Toronto in April, we noted that we had already secured $40 million in cost savings. And at the end of the second quarter, I am pleased to report that number has increased to $74 million out of a total expected savings of $100 million on an annualized basis. We continue to identify new opportunities to gain additional efficiencies throughout our supply chain.
Turning to our operations, and starting at Red Lake, safe gold production totaled 89,500 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,066 per ounce. Production decreased over the prior quarter as expected as a result of lower ore tonnes from the remnant mining of the Campbell Complex. Fewer stopes were available in the High Grade Zone at Red Lake, while planned destress activities took place. These destress efforts are expected to be completed this quarter, leaving Red Lake positioned for a stronger second half.
Drilling continued from the surface on HG Young, an exciting new discovery about 1.5 kilometers northwest of the Campbell Complex on Goldcorp's 100% owned ground. We continue to see high-grade intercepts, with 3 rigs drilling from surface and we are starting the rehabilitation of an historic drift from Campbell to allow accelerated drilling from underground.
Exploration is continuing on the next zone, as well as the R and Footwall zones, where we have encountered numerous economic intersections. It's a testament to the exceptional nature of the Red Lake camp, but successful exploration results are still being returned after 60 years of mining.
As we have been discussing with you for some time, growth at PeÃ±asquito was expected as we moved into the higher grade portions of the deposit. And I am pleased to report we are delivering as promised. For the second quarter, safe gold production increased to a record 167,400 ounces at record low all-in sustaining cost of $362 per ounce. These impressive results came as a result of increased throughput, grades and recoveries, due in part to the success of our operating for excellence initiatives.
Initial construction permits for the Northern Well Field project were received during the quarter. Completion of the Northern Well Field project is still expected mid-year 2015 and there are contingency plans in place for freshwater supply to the site until the Northern Well Field is completed.
The pre-feasibility studies for the concentrated enrichment process and pyrite leach project that we discussed in detail at the Analyst Day are advancing and expected to be completed late this year and early 2015. The concentrated enrichment process provides a significant opportunity by producing a clean copper concentrate, while mitigating deleterious elements.
Pyrite leach would increase gold recoveries and has the potential to convert waste to economic production by unlocking gold and silver from pyrite.
At Porcupine, safe production totaled 68,800 ounces at low all-in sustaining cost of $895 per ounce. The team has done an excellent job of bringing down costs quarter-over-quarter. Mining operations are expected to commence from Hollinger following completion of the Environmental Control Berm, which is on track to be completed late this year.
Finally, our Musselwhite team delivered another good quarter, with safe production of 67,800 ounces. The team also deserves special mention for their impressive reduction in all-in sustaining cost of $794 per ounce.
In closing, I am very pleased with the execution of our operating team midway through the year. We are delivering safe production as planned and I'm looking forward to a strong second half to meet the guidance we have provided.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Russell for a review of our projects.
Russell D. Ball
Thanks, George. And good day to those on the call. Turning to Slide 14 in Cerro Negro in Argentina, we passed 2 significant milestones last week and we exceeded 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident, and we poured first gold last Friday as Chuck mentioned. Since then we have poured our second bar and the positive momentum continues.
I wanted to take a minute to recognize and thank the team at Cerro Negro for their dedication and hard work. In particular, I wanted to recognize our project director, Bernie Loyer, for his leadership, commitment and dedication to getting this project built and up and running in what were occasionally some very difficult and challenging conditions. Gold production for the year at Cerro Negro remains on track for between 130,000 and 180,000 ounces. In addition, we announced a reduction in the initial capital cost estimate of $100 million, lowering the expected range to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion.
Approximately 50% of the reduction is foreign exchange-driven, with other savings split between the plant and infrastructure, driven by improved labor productivity and cost control. Commercial production continues to be expected in the fourth quarter of 2014. The construction of the high-voltage power line is now complete, with first stage of commissioning completed by the Argentinian Power Authority.
Construction of the Cerro Negro substation is approximately 92% complete, with the system expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter, at which time we will switch away from on-site diesel generation.
Production mining continued at Eureka in the second quarter, with production mining at Mariana Central expected to commence in the first quarter of 2015. Total underground development for the quarter at Eureka and Mariana Central was 2,408 meters. Although development activities at Mariana Norte remain suspended, we're in the process of remobilizing and development is expected to recommence in the fourth quarter of this year.
The ore stockpile and surface at quarter end was approximately 532,000 tonnes, at an average grade of 9.2 grams per tonne gold and 165 grams per tonne silver.
Slide 15 outlines the expected timeline through commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. The next significant milestone is the commissioning of the permanent power system later this quarter.
The photos on Slide 16 show the start up of the plant, with crushed ore in a conveyor headed for the mill. The mill in operation, first gold being poured in the first dore bar, as I said, which was poured last week.
Slide 17. We turn our attention to ÃlÃ©onore in QuÃ©bec, where initial gold production remains on track for the fourth quarter of this year and in line with the previously disclosed initial capital cost [ph] guidance of between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. We continue to expect gold production of between 40,000 and 60,000 ounces this year and between 575,000 and 625,000 ounces a year upon ramp up to nameplate capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day, which currently we anticipate to incur in the first half of 2018.
At quarter end, engineering was essentially complete and construction was approximately 90% complete. Key activities during the quarter included the first stockpiling of ore on surface, commissioning of the underground ore handling system, and the first production blast.
At the mine, the exploration ramp reached 5,007 meters, corresponding to a depth of 733 meters below surface and the production shaft reached a depth of 842 meters.
Exploration drilling continues to be focused on the 494 zone, the hanging wall and the south shoot, while continuing to in-fill the lower mine area. A total of almost 23,000 meters of underground drilling was completed in the quarter, with 5 diamond drills currently drilling on-site.
Slide 18 shows our expected timeline through to the design throughput of 7,000 tonnes a day. While the timeline remains unchanged, we continue to look at options to accelerate the ramp up to design throughput and potentially beyond.
The third quarter is going to be a busy but exciting time for all of us as the mine ramps up production and the process plant approaches start-up in anticipation of first gold in the fourth quarter. I look forward to providing an update on our third quarter call.
Slide 19 shows a number of recent photos, including the line tailings management facility and the industrial water treatment plant, which was successfully commissioned this quarter at its design capacity of 26,000 cubic meters a day.
Turning to Slide 20, Cochenour at Red Lake. The project remains on track with the previously disclosed initial capital estimate of $496 million. The development of the ramp to the 3,540-foot level is 62% complete and the decline to the 4,000-foot level will commence after the completion of the 3,540-foot level ramp. The haulage drift was approximately 96% complete at quarter end and is on track to be completed this quarter.
On the exploration side, drilling continues on the Bruce Channel deposit with 7 rigs -- 7 drills, sorry, on-site at quarter end and 9 drills expected by the end of the year. Results to date are encouraging and in line with our expectations.
Slide 22 (sic) [ 21 ] outlines our expected timeline through commercial production, currently expected in the second half of 2016 after we complete the required underground development. In line with previous guidance, we expect the first development ore from Cochenour in the fourth quarter of this year and the first production ore in the third quarter of 2015.
On Slide 22, moving to Camino Rojo in Mexico, which is approximately 50 kilometers from our PeÃ±asquito mine, we expect to commence a pre-feasibility study by the end of the year. This is approximately 5 months later than originally anticipated due to expansion of the metallurgical test program to ensure we have adequate data on which to design the process flow sheet. The pit geotechnical program commenced in 2014 and infill drilling continues. We expect the pre-feasibility study to be completed in early 2016.
Turning to El Morro on Slide 23. As discussed on our first quarter call, in a unanimous decision the Court of Appeals in CopiapÃ³ dismissed the 3 claims that were before the court. This decision was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court in Santiago and we expect the final decision later this year.
In addition to addressing the legal challenges, we are currently focused on community and stakeholder engagement activities, in addition to planning for a 2014-2015 drilling campaign, which will focus on infill and geotech drilling, with the goal of converting input waste in the current mine plant to ore.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lindsay for this quarter's financial review.
Lindsay A. Hall
Thanks, Russell. Another real strong quarter of financial results coming from solid production and cost performance, with gold sales of 639,500 ounces and all-in sustaining cost of $852 per ounce, despite being impacted by the work suspension at Los Filos and the Marigold divestiture.
With the average realized gold price of $1,296 per ounce during the quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter, the lower byproduct cash cost contributed to stronger margins and increased operating cash flows. All-in sustaining costs for the second quarter were $852 per ounce compared to $840 per ounce in the prior quarter. The slight increase in our all-in sustaining cost was primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditures, lower volumes due to the work suspension at Los Filos, and offset by lower byproduct cash cost. The details of the all-in sustaining cost calculation are disclosed on Page 38 of our MD&A.
Net earnings for the second quarter increased to $183 million from $98 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter amounted to $164 million or $0.20 per share compared to $209 million or $0.26 per share in the first quarter. The decrease in adjusted net earnings is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate. The detailed calculation of the adjusted net earnings is disclosed on Page 40 of our MD&A.
Consistent with previous quarters, we did not make any adjustments to the noncash share-based compensation expense, which amounted to $16 million or $0.02 per share.
The income tax provision included in our calculated adjusted earnings for the second quarter has an effective tax rate of 24%. To calculate the effective tax rate, one needs to adjust the booked income tax expense of $14 million for the following items: add the foreign exchange gains and deferred income tax assets and liabilities of $24 million, the income tax expense related to the second quarter earnings of PV and Alumbrera of $18 million, and the tax impact on revisions and estimates on reclamation and closure cost of $5 million. Then, from earnings before tax, the following adjustments are made: deduct share of net earnings of associates of $60 million and add back $16 million of stock-based compensation, representing permanent differences as these items will never be taxable. Then you need to add to earnings before tax for PV and Alumbrera of $69 million, as well as a revision and estimates of -- on reclamation and closure cost of $16 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24% for the quarter. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact -- the higher effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the Argentina and Mexican inflation impacts during the quarter.
The outlook for the annual effective tax rate remains at 26% for the year and 36% for the last 2 quarters of 2014, excluding the foreign exchange impact on deferred taxes.
Turning to provisional pricing. We had a positive provisional pricing of $1 million at PeÃ±asquito and a positive $2.6 million at Alumbrera. The Q2 provisional pricing at PeÃ±asquito will reflect 102,800 ounces of gold priced at $1,315 per ounce; 4.2 million ounces of silver at $21 per ounce; 37.9 million pounds of zinc priced at $1 per pound; and $20.1 million pounds of lead priced at $0.97 per pound, while at Alumbrera will reflect 13,200 ounces of gold priced at $1,315 per ounce and 22.9 million pounds of copper priced at $319 per pound.
Lastly, some of the uses and sources of cash. In June, the company raised 1 billion of senior unsecured notes. We intend to use these proceeds to repay the $863 million convertible senior note, which matures in August of this year. During the second quarter, the company continued to generate strong cash flows from operations, with adjusted operating cash flows of $366 million or $0.46 per share. We invested $550 million at both our operating mines and projects and paid $122 million in dividends this quarter. Of the $550 million, 70% of the spending related to our capital projects, $144 million and $194 million at Cerro Negro and ÃlÃ©onore, respectively. We also received $235 million in cash, primarily from the disposition of our interest in the Marigold mine.
Continuing strong cash flows and well-managed capital investments are part of the Goldcorp's established goal of financial discipline. With $375 million in cash, after giving effect to the August repayment of the convertible senior debt, and $2 billion undrawn on our revolver facility, we continue to be very comfortable in our ability to fund our capital programs, both at our operating mines and the new projects under the current lower gold prices.
With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
My question pretty much is all about PeÃ±asquito. Obviously, an outstanding quarter there. I just wanted to know, obviously you're not changing guidance, but what sort of guidance would there be on tonnage grade, recovery and even cost per tonne, can you guys sort of give us going into the second half and maybe even into '15, a sneak peak?
Charles A. Jeannes
I'll pass that over to George.
George R. Burns
Andrew, we're going to be running that mill about 115,000 tonnes a day and that is our plan going forward at this point. In terms of production, if you look at our guidance of between $530 million and $560 million, we had a strong first half, be a little less in the second half to hit that guidance, and you can work the numbers from there.
Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
And cost per tonne, George? It came down this quarter. Do you see that as being a run rate -- on to $1 million [indiscernible], obviously, on-site. Is that sort of something we can run through? Or is it -- because it's obviously come down significantly from Q1.
George R. Burns
You can use the year-to-date cost per tonne numbers and apply those to the second half.
Charles A. Jeannes
Yes, if I can just add there. We've talked a lot in our disclosure the last 2 years about our operating for excellence program and that's really where it's focused is on those unit costs that we can control and we're pretty happy with the way those have come down. And George and his team, obviously, will continue to work those. And as we see the throughput come up, we're seeing the milling unit cost come down for sure.
Operator
Our next question is from Stephen Walker with RBC Capital Markets.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just a couple of questions, follow-up questions on PeÃ±asquito. I just wanted to get a sense of 2 things on the CET [ph] process. At the Analyst Day in April, you spoke about capital for both the leach upgrade and the CET [ph] upgrade as less than a $1 billion, I think, is the number that was out there. Is that sort of capital number that you're still expecting, albeit it's still fairly early in pre-feasibility stage process?
George R. Burns
Yes, the CEP project is a lot small -- a lot lighter on capital intensity and the pyrite leach is more. We're processing a lot of -- basically, all the pyrite coming through the whole circuit and we're working on the feasibility study now. We're going to have better numbers for you towards the end of the year.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
In the MD&A you suggested that it could be potentially separate projects. They are not mutually exclusive or do they have to be combined projects? Can you do 1 without the other?
George R. Burns
They're independent projects. We prefer to bring them on together in terms of construction efficiencies, but we can do 1 or the other or both.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Given that the copper sulfate -- sulfosalt, excuse me, extend upward into the existing pit shell and obviously, that's not a linear demarcation between the currently mined oxide, sulphide material and then the copper sulfide -- sulfosalt. There's a gradational zone there. When would you start hitting enough copper arsenic antimony in this transition zone where your PCRCs [ph] would increase to the point where there's significant penalty elements being incurred. Are we looking out 2 years, 3 years? What I'm trying to get a sense of is what is the timing on when you have to make a decision and actually have to have the CET [ph] process up and running before PCRCs go through the ceiling and you basically see a significant drop in revenues?
George R. Burns
So when we put together a new life of mine plan at the beginning of the year, it focused the phases for the next 5 years kind of to the north. And so that's given us breathing room in terms of the more complicated ores that will largely benefit from the CEP process. So we've got time. The quicker we bring it on, the more flexibility we have. But in the short term, there's no pressure in our mine plan. There will be some incremental benefit coming out of it. In terms of pyrite leach, we're getting lower recoveries currently in the circuit because most of the gold associated with the pyrite goes out to tailings. So the sooner we can bring that project online, the quicker we bump the overall recoveries up. And then the other thing is both projects kind of change the economics of the deposit and there's currently waste in the current mine plan. With this new capital and the improved recoveries and reduced penalties, some of the waste becomes ore. So that impacts strip ratio. So there's a number of benefits that'll come out of these projects, but there's no short-term pressure to get them done. The sooner the better and we're working hard to get the engineering completed, so that we can make a decision.
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just given the revenues involved, I would have thought the pyrite leach process would have been sort of initiated before now. Has it just been the zonation of where the gold mineralization is within the mine plan or water bottleneck issue? Curious why hasn't pyrite leach been started previous to now?
George R. Burns
Really, it's test work that's happened since we started up the mine where we've really understood the orebody better and the pyrite leach project is something that happened between our corporate and site team to take a look at the capital intensity to be able to float the pyrite and then leach it. So they're both really new projects that we've been focused on for maybe a year or so, and it's pretty quick move from concept into engineering so...
Stephen D. Walker - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Just one sort of last but long question on Camino Rojo. The sentence was used, "complexity of metallurgical testing." What does that mean as first part? Second part is, have you begun negotiations with the Ejidos on Camino Rojo? And then third part to that is has the land agreement with -- or the layback agreement with Carrizalillo been completed here? I know you were talking with them earlier in the year, but I'm curious if that's been completed. Great, that's all my questions.
George R. Burns
It's George. I'll talk to the metallurgical complexity. This is a poly-metallic deposit similar to PeÃ±asquito. We've learned a lot at PeÃ±asquito and one of the key things is to really understand all the different ore types and mineral types. So we've been doing test work. And as a result, identifying multiple different types of mineralization. And the outcome of that test work, we're doing follow-up test work to be able to refine the flow sheets. So it's not anything super-complex, it's just we want to get this right. And based on the first set of metallurgical tests, we're doing some follow-up work, so we can refine the flow sheet.
Russell D. Ball
Steve, it's Russ. As far as negotiations, we continue with our engagement. We have not begun detailed negotiations yet. And we continue ongoing discussions and I've been working very closely with [indiscernible] on a number of options that would make sense for both of us down there, but we have nothing to report. We continue to work on progressing that.
Operator
Our next question is from John Bridges with JPMorgan.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Chuck, a big question -- big picture question. Given the projects that you point to in your introduction that are coming to fruition and you can lean back and smile and enjoy life, but of course, you can't. What's the next step to put in place the projects for the next 3, 4 years, when you look at how life has become difficult for some of the other projects -- other players. Then it's critically important that you're strategizing as to where you want to be in 5 years. What's your thinking at the moment?
Charles A. Jeannes
Well, we're certainly not going to sit back and take some time off. I mean, we put ourselves into this position through a lot of hard work to get the operations running very well and efficiently and at low cost and to bring on the new projects so that we have the opportunity to continue to improve the company. And so the way we look at it is where are we going to allocate that free cash flow going forward? Of course, we're committed to our dividend and we'd like to grow that dividend, but we also have a series of exciting new projects coming up organically within the organization. And as always, we look at all sorts of opportunities around the world from an M&A standpoint. And as Russell likes to say, we don't really care whether we're buying our own yellow trucks or buying somebody else's. We will line up these projects side-by-side and see where we get the best returns, where we can provide the best return for our shareholders and then we'll make the decision. But we don't really have a particular strategy that says we will buy 1 or 2 or 3 things over the next x years. Because we've got so many great organic opportunities, we don't have to buy anything, we'll just look at them as they come available and see how they stack up compared to what we've already got.
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And you're still thinking of being better rather than bigger?
Charles A. Jeannes
Excuse me?
John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And you still want to be better rather than bigger?
Charles A. Jeannes
Absolutely. And if you look at what we've done over the past several years as we sell off noncore assets, we extend indefinitely, I think, the time that we become too big to grow. And we'll continue to do that. It's a matter of continuing to optimize the overall portfolio and make sure that we've got the best assets we can that deliver the best performance from a financial perspective to our shareholders.
Operator
Our next question is from Patrick Chidley with HSBC.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
[indiscernible]
Charles A. Jeannes
Sorry, Patrick, we're having a hard time hearing you there.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
Can you hear me?
Charles A. Jeannes
Yes.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
Yes, I just -- I wanted to ask about PeÃ±asquito and about the water situation there. So you've begun to get permits for the actual, I guess, it's the Northern basin. But I wanted to know do you need permits to put a pipeline in? And is that something that you've got in hand already or are still working on it?
Charles A. Jeannes
Yes, I'm just going to repeat the question because I'm not sure we all heard it. You asked -- you commented on the fact that we received the permits for the Northern Well Field and asked if those permits were necessary to put in the pipeline. And maybe George and Russell, you can talk about it. It's not just pipeline, it's also the wells and the pump stations and everything else.
George R. Burns
It is the Northern Well Field. Essentially it's road pipeline, power line. And so we need permit -- environmental permits and surface rights permits in order to begin that construction. And so yes, we've got the permits now. In fact, last quarter, we had the permits to put the camp in and start mobilizing the contractor. Now we've got permits to put in the bulk of the roads, pipeline and infrastructure for the well field. So that work is just kicking off now.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
Okay. And then this quarter you've sort of highlighted the skarn -- deep skarn exploration at Penasquito. Just wondering what your target is in terms of target date when you sort of define something that is sort of a scoping study, as it were, and [indiscernible] about the size and how that might contribute?
Charles A. Jeannes
Yes, we've been talking about this for some time, Patrick. It's a very large discovery and we've given you at the Analyst Day some slides that Charlie went through on the depth and aerial extent of what we were seeing. But it was very widely space drilled and we've been doing infill drilling to try to get a better sense of it. So I think, I'll let Russell correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the schedule is to finish up the drilling this year, update a resource and then turn it over to the project guys to start looking at some early stage scoping and economic analysis.
Russell D. Ball
Yes, Chuck, you're spot on.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
And then just down the road at Camino Rojo. You said expiration is going pretty well. Can you update us on the met test work a little bit more? And also on the local community negotiations?
Charles A. Jeannes
Yes, we couldn't hear you there, Patrick. I heard community negotiations at the end.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
Yes, and the met test work.
Charles A. Jeannes
The met test work? Yes, we just talked about that with Stephen. I'm not sure if you heard it. But the met test work is just finishing up and we'll be turning that over to the pre-feasibility team and the community negotiations continue and we're building relationships and partnerships there and we will -- we're advancing those discussions and hope to have them completed soon.
Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division
Okay. And just a follow-up on PeÃ±asquito, the issue with the Ejido there that you had, what stage is that?
Charles A. Jeannes
George?
George R. Burns
Yes, the Cerro Gordo Ejido continue in negotiations. The federal government is involved in mediation and we remain optimistic we'll come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Our next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC
Concerning El Morro, where you got the good court decision and I think that might be the first one Lorenzo Soto lost in a while. And Camino Rojo where you mentioned at the Investor Day possibly 100,000 ton a day mill and the $1 billion of notes that were issued recently. Should we think of these 2 projects as independent rather than either/or? And what do you think is the highest level of debt you'll accept and the highest level of CapEx you would have in 1 year? I don't know if you sort of have a fixed number in mind, but the combination of the debt issue, the favorable ruling in El Morro and the good progress at Camino Rojo motivated my question.
Charles A. Jeannes
Those are good questions and the kind of thing we think about going forward. We're advancing Camino Rojo. El Morro from a technical standpoint is a bit ahead, but there are some things that we may want to relook at there in terms of how we design it and of course that will push it back into some additional permitting. The way I look at it is, and I've talked to Russell about this is, there's a bit of a competition to see which one of these projects looks best. Because I think the answer is that it would be pretty challenging to start 2 $3 billion to $4 billion builds at the same time. I'm not saying there might not be overlap, but I would like to be focused on one and get it quite a ways down the road before we start big capital spending on the other. So the goal we have now is to do the analysis, do the study work, get the economic picture of both projects together and then see which one we want to go with first and which one may be ready first. As far as the debt level is concerned, we've always said that we are committed to remaining an investment grade company and we, as you know, have the only BBB+ rating in the gold space and we're quite proud of that and we think it provides us competitive advantage. So when I go to my friend, Lindsay Hall, and ask him how much money I can have, he -- that number might change from time to time based on those various metrics that the rating agencies use and we use to judge ourselves on -- debt to EBITDA and debt to equity and the like. So it's a moving number. But if you look at those metrics and run them through your model, you'll get a sense of what we believe is additional cash that we're comfortable borrowing.
John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC
If I could ask a second question.
Charles A. Jeannes
John, before you go on, there was one other part of your question I didn't answer and that was with respect to the $1 billion notes issue we just had in the quarter. As Lindsay said, that was intended to pay off the convertible bond that comes due next month in August. So don't consider that sitting in our pockets to build something.
John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC
Excuse me. Do you still consider Chile to be an acceptable investment destination, that's the second question? I'm a little taken aback that the President appointed new directors that fired the head of Codelco. She's talking about nationalizing the water companies, rewriting the constitution, 5% tax hike, no deferral to accelerate depreciation, stricter environmental enforcement. It sounds like it's going crazy down there. And Freeport is rumored to be selling out of Candelaria.
Charles A. Jeannes
We're not going to comment on what other companies are doing. I would say, absolutely, Chile remains a place that we'll look to do business. All jurisdictions have changing political and tax regimes that we have to pay attention to and we run sensitivities and the numbers we use when analyzing projects. But you also got to look at Chile as having outstanding infrastructure and labor and professional capacity for mining. There's -- it's a very important part of the economy and the country, and there's benefit from that as well. So you look at the whole picture, you run your numbers based on the sensitivities around things like the tax rates and the cost of doing business and then you decide to go or not go. And certainly, Chile is still on the list of companies where we -- or countries where we'd like to do business.

Our next question is from David Haughton with BMO.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
David Haughton here. Just going back to PeÃ±asquito, I don't want to be flogging this to death, but what's your expected capital outlay for the Well Field development and the tying in of that with the mine side?
Russell D. Ball
David, it's Russ. Total capital that we've approved for that is $150 million. And we think we'll have spent somewhere around $70 million to $80 million by year end depending on progress in the field.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. So that just means in the first half next year balance is just paid out?
Russell D. Ball
And just as an observation to the -- really a point that, I think, Chuck and Lindsay made is, that's part of why we see the high all-in sustaining cost in the second half, we've got roughly $70 million of the Northern Well Field and then another $70 million next year that will go in that all-in sustaining cost for PeÃ±asquito.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. Interesting point. So you're going to consider that to be sustaining capital rather than development CapEx?
Russell D. Ball
Yes, correct.
Charles A. Jeannes
Well, yes, and if I can comment on that, I know there's a lot of discussion out there about what goes in and what goes out. We are trying to be very -- I guess, true to the concept of what an all-in sustaining cost is and something like this is -- it's a major capital expenditure, but it's simply intended to sustain what we had already planned to do at PeÃ±asquito. And so that's how we're accounting for it rather than sticking it in a different bucket.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Yes, good to hear. And perhaps for George, the recoveries had picked up at PeÃ±asquito. I'm not trying to make too much out of a single quarter here, but is that related to the better grade and what should we be thinking recovery-wise going forward?
George R. Burns
The high recoveries are a combination of 2 things. Grade is part of the equation, but the other thing is operating for excellence. Our team at PeÃ±asquito is focused on improving that recovery and it boils down to rebuilding and upgrades to the flotation circuit and better reagent dosing and the combination of those 2 we're seeing -- as you've seen in the numbers, better recoveries across the -- all 4 metals. And I look for that to continue.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. So for gold, you feel pretty comfortable with that low 70 kind of level recovery?
George R. Burns
Yes.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Okay. Just going over now to Cerro Negro, good to see that you've got some pretty healthy-looking stockpiles there, so a good kickstart for the processing and ultimately, when it goes commercial back end this year. Will we be getting an update of the grade profile as these -- as you get to understand the sequencing of the veins coming through? Can we expect to see that somewhere in future?
Russell D. Ball
Yes, David, it's Russ and George will jump in here because we're about to hand the project over to the operations group. But we're essentially going through a 0 base on the budget and life of mine plan this year looking at a number of different development options and bringing in some additional contractors to help out on the development. So we look forward to being able to share that with you once we have had a chance to go through the numbers, get them approved by the board. So I would say, early next year and certainly at the Analyst Day. I think, it's fair to say that we'll probably spend a little bit more time on Cerro Negro talking through our expectations. George, I don't know if you want to add?
George R. Burns
Spot on.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
That sounds good because it's some time since we've seen something like that over a number of years and possibly life of mine. Just flipping back and last topic now, Los Filos. Pleased to see that you got the Ejido issue sorted out and presumably with that 5-year rollover, you won't go through the kind of pain that you've gone previously. Are there any implications there that we should be thinking about as far as the costs? Are there any royalties or anything that we should take note of that is -- are meaningful as far as the cost base goes?
George R. Burns
No. No material change. I mean that -- the only comment I can make is that, that 6-week shutdown put a lot of pressure on Filos for the year. But going forward, we're happy now that we have the stability of that 5-year agreement and no material change in cost as a result of those negotiations.
Russell D. Ball
I'd add a interesting opportunity that we've just surfaced and we've put a team on. As you know, El Sauzal is coming to an end fairly soon and we think there is an opportunity to move that mill over to Filos and significantly change the economics of that go forward life of mine. So we're excited about that opportunity. And it's one of us ones that Chuck spoke to a little earlier, we have a wealth of internal organic opportunities that we can deploy capital in.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
That's very interesting because the mill option had always been kicked around, but from a standing start, it didn't seem to stack up economically, so redeployment of that one might work rather well.
Charles A. Jeannes
It backs up better when you don't have to pay for the mill.
George R. Burns
The other thing is that our exploration on the undergrounds moved progressively over the last couple of years. And so we're excited about not only looking at putting a mill and moving the mill over, but expanding the underground production and obviously that's higher grade and it supports the mill strategy.
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Well, I guess, U.K. [ph] had been there for a while and had from time to time contributed some, but not really big. Perhaps with the mill [indiscernible].
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
And just -- on the pad expansion, as a result of the pad expansion, can we expect some better recovery ratios as you're putting down material on that pad?
George R. Burns
Improved what?
David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada
Recovery ratios at faster [ph] leach?
George R. Burns
I mean -- obviously, we're closer to liner, so the timing to get solution into the plant is a bit quicker. But on the other hand, it's a bit further haul from the pit down into that new area. So I wouldn't look for any significant change. We're just glad to have that extended pad space and we're set up for the life of mine.

Our next question is from Michael Gray with Macquarie Capital.
Michael J. Gray - Macquarie Research
A question on the HG Young discovery you've highlighted in Red Lake in the slide deck and pointed towards in the Investor Day that you're going to drill. Can you comment on whether this right now looks like a good discovery to maybe -- but more of a sideshow to supplement feed to Campbell or is it a potential serious discovery that seems to have some of the comparable features to Campbell on the High Grade Zone?
George R. Burns
I'm really excited about -- this is George. It's early days. But when you look at the thicknesses in grade associated with some of these intercepts, we're really excited about it. We actually had planned on drilling this, this year from surface only. Based on the exciting results we've seen thus far, we're rehabbing the 14 Level drift heads north from Campbell in order to get underground drills in there later this year and we're looking at phasing additional development from Campbell in order to accelerate underground drilling and hopefully, eventually production. So I'm really excited about it. It is early days and we've got really 2 different types of mineralization we're chasing. Our geologists had come up with a theory that intersecting structures, the plunge of those intersecting structures were a good target and we've had really nice hit ratios as they've drilled those targets. But on top of that, we've got a contact we've drilled through and that's where we're seeing some of the better thicknesses in grades. And so that's generated the excitement, really, 2 different types of targets, great results thus far, and look forward to getting those underground drills in and really understanding how important this is. At this point, I've been with the company 7 years, I'm more excited about this than anything I've seen yet.
Michael J. Gray - Macquarie Research
I know at the Investor Day, I think, you guys mentioned halter [indiscernible], too, which is a good sign. That's great. And the amount of drilling between now and the end of the year, whether from surface or elsewhere?
George R. Burns
We've added 1 surface drill and then we'll get these underground drills before the end of the year.
Charles A. Jeannes
I haven't seen a meter number. We don't have that for you right now, Mike.
Michael J. Gray - Macquarie Research
Okay, fair enough. And last question: with the 7 drills at Cochenour and 9 drills by the end of the year. What's the amount of drilling you expect by the end of 2014 to sketch in Cochenour?
Lindsay A. Hall
I don't have that handy. We can -- I'll get it to Jeff and he'll shoot it over to you.

There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Jeannes.
Charles A. Jeannes
I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and for all the great questions and attention. I know this has been a tough week with a lot of reports out. So I hope you get a chance to enjoy the weekend. To close, it's certainly an exciting and important time at Goldcorp as we transition out of multiyear period of major capital investment into a period where our shareholders will see the fruits of those investments. So we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the months to come. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of summer and we'll talk to you in the fall. Thank you.
