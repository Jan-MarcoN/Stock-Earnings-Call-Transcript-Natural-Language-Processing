Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thanks for taking the time to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results. We had a strong fourth quarter, in which we exceeded the $100 million mark for both revenue and billings for the first time. This is a significant milestone for us. Back in 2010 our revenue in our first quarter, as a public company was $20 million. Since that point we've grown as a company in so many ways. I'm extremely proud of the entire BroadSoft team which has made that possible.
2016, in particular, was a banner year for us, I want to take a moment to walk through our key accomplishment and activities from the year. First, we achieved greater than 3 million lines of sell-through in 2016 and surpassed 16 million hosted unified communications lines, which we believe is at least three-times greater than our next closest competitor.
Second, we introduced BroadSoft Business, a suite of unified communications, contact center and team collaboration applications that all leverage BroadSoft Hub. Hub enables contextual integration and application notification to improve productivity.
Third, we had a number of significant unified communications service launches around the globe including Vodafone One Net, Rogers Unison, AT&T Collaborate, Verizon One Talk and Deutsche Telekom's Cloud PBX. Importantly, most of these offerings are either mobile-centric or converged fixed mobile offerings.
Fourth, we continued our BroadCloud expansion, bringing new channels and applications to market. We also launched in France and are now available in five countries. Fifth, we signed the largest software deal in BroadSoft's history, worth in excess of $40 million over a three-year period.
We also received external validation of our accomplishments. To name just a few, BroadCloud UC-One was named TMC's Unified Communications Product of the Year, Gartner position us as a Visionary in the North American Magic Quadrant for Contact Center as a Service, and just recently IHS Markit reported that we powered 38% of UC as a service seats globally.
As we head into 2017, we see that our service provider partners are becoming even more excited about their unified communications and collaboration market opportunity. Our survey taken during our Connections Users' conference found our partners expect to see faster adoption of cloud communications offerings and growth in the medium to large enterprise segment, strong interest in demand for mobile solutions and strong demand for contact center and team collaboration services. Interestingly, our partners felt that team collaboration integrated with unified communications was a significant differentiator and that contact center expanded their market opportunity.
With BroadSoft Business we believe we are in a great position to capitalize on these trends. Our BroadSoft Business portfolio is built around three separate but related communications and collaboration applications. Each application offers innovations designed to simplify the process of getting work done.
While individually each application provides great value, together they offer a transformational experience. I want to take a moment to provide you with an update on the customer traction to our CC-One contact center application and our Team-One team collaboration application.
I'll start with CC-One. Since the acquisition we've been developing the go-to-market programs, we need to deliver this application through our service provider channels and recruiting partners who want to focus on this area.
Recently Masergy announced that they were deploying our CC-One application. Masergy has been a closest successful partner of BroadSoft for many years and we're sure they selected BroadSoft Business, CC-One to build out their cloud contact center portfolio. We expect to make more CC-One partner announcements throughout the year.
On Team-One our customers are excited about the ability to participate, in what is expected to be a billion-dollar market opportunity in team collaboration solutions. Within the last several months since the product launched at (07:33) Connections, we have started internal trials of more than 50 service providers located around the world. We expect to see many of these partners convert from the internal trial stage for offering Team-One to their end customers later this year.
So now, as we got these great products in the hands of our partners the next step is to accelerate getting them in the hands of end-users. At Connections, we launched our new partner go-to-market and branding program Powered by BroadSoft, Powered by BroadSoft combines marketing program to a co-branding element and focuses on end-user success. How the end-user buys and uses these products, how they understand the value for their business across the board, and the branding component creates differentiation for ourselves and our service provider partners.
At Connections, we've shared some data from a pilot with one of our customers, Gamma Communications PLC. For those of you not familiar with Gamma, they are a UK competitive operator with robust, direct and channel sales. They are known for being highly innovative in their service offerings and channel management which has helped drive their proven track record of strong sales and growth. They are also, of course, a great BroadSoft partner.
By utilizing the Powered by BroadSoft go-to-market programs, digital content, customized campaigns, partner program e-books and end-user training, they saw more than a 50% improvement as compared to their typical campaign conversion rates. We had the official Powered by BroadSoft launch about a month ago and we've already signed up a number of service providers, and hope to replicate the success we saw with Gamma.
In addition, as part of the Powered by BroadSoft initiative, we've made a concerted effort to reach out the industry analysts. At Connections, we had a large number of industry analysts in attendance and received a lot of positive coverage. This is great for our brand recognition, but is also significant because industry analysts are important influencers of medium and large organizations, and as they make purchases â decisions (09:27) for unified communications, contact center and collaboration solutions.
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I want to take a moment to welcome Dino Di Palma to BroadSoft. Dino is our Chief Revenue Officer and will lead our worldwide sales and Professional Services Organization. Dino joins us from Benu Networks where he served as CEO, but most of you probably remember him from his time at Acme Packet where he served as our Chief Operating Officer.
BroadSoft and Acme were strategic partners, so I have known Dino and had the pleasure of working with him for more than a decade. I can attest that Dino is perfect fit here. He knows us, he knows our customer base and the service provider industry extremely well and he has expertise in running high-performance sales organizations. I'm very pleased he has joined BroadSoft and look forward to his many contributions ahead.
So, to close out, it's an exciting time for BroadSoft. We finished the year on a strong note ending with our first ever $100 million revenue and billings quarter. We have a great secular market opportunity in front of us and we are well-positioned to capitalize on it, as we head into 2017.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thanks, Mike. We are pleased with our Q4 and 2016 results. Total revenue for Q4 was $102 million, up 14% from the year ago quarter and billings were $109 million, up 20% year-over-year. For the full year 2016, revenue was $341 million, up 22% and billings of $339 million were up 18%. Our revenue performance coupled with lower than expected expenses drove Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 which was above the guidance range we've provided at the end of October.
Full-year 2016 non-GAAP EPS was $2.30. On software license revenue for the quarter was $33 million, down 6% year-over-year and $129 million for the full year, up 8%. Software license billings in the quarter were $32 million, down 13% year-over-year, and for the year software license billings were $114 million, down 10%. While software billings were down, sell-through remained solid with our installed base of hosted seats growing to over 16 million lines representing growth of over 3 million lines, or 25% from about 13 million lines at the end of 2015.
Our subscription and maintenance support revenue which is 100% recurring revenue, in Q4 was $40 million up 32% year-over-year. Of the $40 million, maintenance support revenue was $26 million, 19% year-over-year and SaaS revenue was $14 million up 63% versus the year ago period and 11% sequentially.
For the year, our subscription and maintenance support revenue was $147 million, up 30% from 2015. Of that maintenance support was $95 million up 21% and SaaS was $52 million up 49%. The acquisition of VoIP Logic in late October 2016 contributed less than $1 million of revenue to our SaaS number.
We finished year with just over 400,000 BroadCloud subs. Professional services and other revenue was $28 million up 20% year-over-year. Billings were $23 million up 88% versus last year's Q4. For the year professional services revenue were $65 million up 41% from 2015.
And looking at revenue for Q4 and the year I think the headlines are, one, solid overall growth in line with our expectations; and two, some revenue mix challenges as we saw softness in license software and strengthen maintenance and support and in professional services.
The softness in license software billings was primarily in North America, we saw growth in our other regions. Interestingly, North America was the geography that had the greatest number of transformation projects and with that significant growth in professional services.
I will note that the software orders for transformation projects we've gotten have been from new market launches, which means new subscribers and we have not yet seen any appreciable orders from what we expect to be sizable subscriber migrations off of legacy platforms.
As I mentioned underlying sell-through remains solid and while having our service provider customers deploy greater than 3 million seats in 2016, it's pretty significant from an overall market size standpoint and nice growth off of their base of 13 million deployed seats. It was only up a bit relative to 2015 so this phenomenon tends to flatten our software growth.
In 2016, we saw billings decline despite increased sell-through which suggests some relative tightening of carrier implied inventory. Our planning for 2017 is this â this tightened implied carrier inventory level is the new normal for us.
As I discussed earlier our maintenance support revenue grew 22% in 2016 some of this growth was really from large multiyear software deals where a portion of the revenue and the billings for software manifested itself through this revenue line item.
On professional services, we had meaningful growth in revenue in billings in Q4 and the full year 2016. This was driven by our strategic and transformation projects for major Tier 1 service providers in North America and internationally.
As Mike mentioned, we achieved customer acceptance in commercial launches for several of these project in 2016, including Deutsche Telekom, Cloud PBX launch in Q4. This market launches are significant milestones for BroadSoft in the UC market.
So, what does all this suggest for 2017, as we discussed last quarter and as you've seen from our press release, we expect total revenue of $390 million to $400 million. We believe we will see software license revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range, and expect to see software license billings growth as well.
We also expect to see greater contributions to software from our transformation projects and expect to be â this to be pretty backend loaded for us. We are being a bit cautious on the timing of legacy subscriber migration in these transformation projects.
We expect our subscription and support revenue to be in the $170 million to $180 million range, of which our SaaS business is expected to be in the $65 million to $68 million zip code. For SaaS we expect contributions from continued market expansion, hybrid software SasS opportunities and growth from our CC-One and Team-One offerings.
Professional services should continue its growth and perhaps grow faster than overall revenue due to continued activity from transformation and other strategic projects.
Now moving onto cost and margins. For Q4, we had gross margin of 80% versus 82% in a year ago period. We achieved solid gross margin performance, but we're down a couple ticks given revenue mix. Specifically, our SaaS and professional services revenue lines, both of which are below our corporate gross margin were our fastest growing. For the year, we achieved gross margin of 78%, up from 77% 2015.
We achieved the operating margin of 28% relative to 36% in the prior quarter year period. Operating expenses in the quarter totaled $53 million, up $12 million year-over-year with the primary driver being an increase in overall head count related expenses including from our three acquisitions in 2016.
For the year, we achieved operating margin of 22%, which was above our expectation and similar to what we achieved in 2015. Our expectation for Q1 2017 is that cost of sales plus OpEx will grow in the approximately $2 million range from Q4 2016, split pretty evenly between cost of sales and OpEx.
The expected increase in our overall expenses is due to typical Q1 spikes in head count related benefits and taxes and a full quarter's worth of VoIP Logic costs. This is partially offset by declines in sales and marketing due to a drop off in Connections (18:00) related expenses and lower commissions.
On the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $364 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Accounts receivables of $122 million were up $105 million in Q3. Deferred revenue increased sequentially to $109 million with normal Q4 strength and maintenance billings. Net cash from operations was a very strong $19 million in the quarter and $67 million for the year.
Now to finish up on our thoughts on Q1 of 2017. As you saw on our earnings press release, we expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $78 million to $82 million and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.20. As I mentioned, we expect revenue in the range of $390 million the $400 million year. 2017 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.50.
In terms of our business model, I expect our gross margin will be at a similar level to 2016 software, subscription and maintenance support and professional services are individually likely to be about flattish with the prior year. On the operating expense side, we expect to see pickup in sales and marketing, but should gain back margin points on leverage in R&D and G&A.
On our tax rate for 2016, our actual cash taxes paid amounted to 3% of non-GAAP pre-tax income versus the 5% we had guided which resulted in a $0.05 benefit. We expect that our non-GAAP cash tax rate will be about 5% of non-GAAP pre-tax for 2017 and 2018 and about 9% in 2019. We expect our long-term tax rate to be in the 20%.
In summary, we were pleased with our accomplishments in 2016 and believe we are heading into 2017 with positive market, customer and product momentum.
With that operator, we will open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Your first question is Rich Valera and Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the North American inventory situation. Jim, I think you said you expected this to be the new normal, but do you believe inventories are now down to where they â the carriers want them to be, so there won't be a further absorption of sell-in there.
And as you look into the full year, just wondered how you thought about the split of revenue between the first half and the second half. You said â sounds like you're looking for a pretty back half-weighted year, I'm wondering if you could give any sense of the split between first half, second out that'd helpful. Thank you.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So, on this â so kind of implied inventory, it â may I be honest that impact in 2016 surprised us a little bit about, we talked a little bit about that at our Investor Day. It's on a relative basis at a relative historical low. And so we believe that we're unlikely to see more of absorption in 2017. Inventory is actually relatively lean in â with most customers in North America, it was a few where you saw bit more of a burn off than we expected. So, I guess, one would (22:03) answer this â saying yes, I don't expect to see appreciable â more absorption.
And then â I mean, I think the year looks â I mean, we tend to be pretty backend loaded, Rich. And so I think it's going to be somewhat comparable to that. I know our guide's little bit below for Q1 consensus than the Street and that's also not that atypical. But I don't see that sequence being that different than prior years.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
So using last year as a rough guide would not be a bad way to go or just maybe slightly more back half-weighted.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Well, I think 2015 â 2014 and 2015 are probably a little bit more representative of how I think the year will go. 2016 we had an unusually strong Q1 and so that's â I think that's the biggest difference.
Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Jim.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, thanks for that commentary on your expectations for software billing for 2017. As it relates to total billings, you're obviously going to be comping a really strong year in professional services, do you expect total billings to grow for the year in 2017 or is it too early for that?
And the other question would be, you talked about not having any significant license revenue in the forecast for migration to legacy customers based on these transformation projects, I don't think it's â get a sense of kind of the timing and maybe the scale of the revenue potential when those migrations happen? Thanks.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So I absolutely â we think that â there's a somewhat commensurate total billing's growth for â for next year. And I think we'll see billing's growth actually in all three of the other revenue line items. So yeah, I think that those all look very solid going into next year.
And then from a legacy platform standpoint, let me give a quick answer and let, Mike jump in as well. So the opportunity with the transformation projects are quite literally millions of lines, and millions of lines in North America, millions of lines in specific geographies outside the U.S. As we said, Deutsche Telekom, we just announced in Q4 accepted in commercial launch and that part and parcel of their driving their entire network to all IT and where the platform for all their enterprise telephony.
And so I think we will see revenue from these projects on these legacy migrations â we're just being a little cautious on the timings, so I think over several year period, it's millions of lines and tens of millions of revenue. It's a question of what the impact in 2017 is, and don't know, Mike -
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. I mean just to probably provide a little bit more explanation. So I think what we've seen with these transformational deployments is that the carriers have done integrations and the bulk products really what we would call going after net new customers to begin.
Jim mentioned, Deutsche Telekom for example, launching at the end of last year, a service really targeted net new and that's where a lot of our pro services efforts have been, is working with those transformation customers, building the first net new project. What we're engaged with at a lot of those customers now is again on the pro services side is the toolsets and the tooling processes to do migration.
So we're starting that work with a number of them and as Jim mentioned the relative size is in the millions of lines, those migrations take a fair amount of time to plan and build the right tooling and that's what the pro services teams are doing with those customers. So we're not, I guess, surprised by the process of first going out after net new and then looking at these mass migrations.
Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Norah Kennedy of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Norah Kennedy - Jefferies LLC
Hi, guys. This is Norah for George Notter. I wanted to ask about the SaaS revenue and just think about how we kind of attribute that year-on-year growth applications like Team-One or CC-One versus full BroadCloud seats?
And related to that I'm just hoping you can touch on the trajectory of the BroadCloud gross margins and where we are in that time line of getting closer to the north of 70% target, is that changing at all the addition, the new application offerings like Team-One and CC-One? Thanks.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So, Norah let me parse the questions a bit. So one, Team-One really dot not a revenue contributor right now, it's really additive to the overall product. There may be some standalone revenue, but it's â in 2016 was basically zero.
We are running about $1.6 million a quarter in contact center SaaS revenue, and so that was also true in Q4. And so the rest is really BroadCloud. So the preponderance is BroadCloud. I'm sorry, the second part of your question, oh, margins. So on margins -
Norah Kennedy - Jefferies LLC
Yeah, sorry.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah, so margins for the SaaS business improved in the quarter and we're in mid â mid-high 40s. I am keeping it pretty cautious for next year. I'd like to see us get up to 50% margins in that business for next year, and then I think in 2018 and 2019, we'll start literally tracking toward our on long-term 70% gross margins on SaaS.
Norah Kennedy - Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Dmitry Netis of William Blair. Your line is open.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yes, hi guys. I wanted to follow-up on some of the launches that have occurred in the last six months and wondering if â can you give us a little bit of color what you're seeing from that customer base, particularly would be interesting to get â to take on the North America customers since you had mentioned that the inventory levels have come down there. You had seen some tightening â have that started to move, in your opinion, or you need some of the launches such as Verizon One Talk, AT&T Collaborate, I think the comment on the tractions with those specifically those two customers and product offerings would be very helpful for us?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah, I think Dmitry you were cutting in and out pretty bad there, so let me â I think you're looking for some color on the market launches. I obviously can't get into any individual customer, besides the mentioning of who they were. I think generally we're seeing is that the launches are going fairly well. I think we're seeing fairly high interest for the launches that have a significant mobile contribution or mobile focus. Those were selling quite well into the marketplace.
Each launch is somewhat targeted at a slightly different segment. I think we're seeing again good interest, good volumes, good interests from all of the segments from micro, all the way up to corporate across the various launches both in North America and international.
So I think as I mentioned in my notes, the launches that I mentioned all had some mobile, either mobile first or FMC component. It's clear that that is a significant driver of interest from the end-users. It's significantly positions our service provider customers against the traditional kind of OTT players and really leverages their mobile assets. And, frankly, it leverages the way end users want to work, which is they want to work on their mobile first. They want to be â they want to have all those tools on their mobile devices. So that's the kind of â some of the color I can provide on the launches.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
That's helpful, Mike. Any way to quantify â I mean, I don't know if this is the right way to frame this. But can you maybe tell us qualitatively, quantitatively how much of those new launches are really baked into the guidance. I know maybe I'm asking for too much here. But we're just trying to ascertainment, it's six months into the launch, are you expecting revenue in the sort of ninth months of that launch, 12 months of that launch? I mean, what's the duration roughly when the revenue becomes more and more material and starts to be kind of included in your guidance, if it isn't at this point?
And so I'm just trying to see if it is in the guidance and what's the duration of more of a meaningful contribution from specifically the Verizon and maybe AT&T? Those two would be of the most interest, I suppose, given what we have seen in North America this past year. If you can quantify or give any color that that will be helpful. And then I have one more follow-up, if that's okay with you.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. So, hey, it's Jim. So I guess the following thoughts â they're actually in the annual guidance. I don't think they're spectacularly in the annual guidance, but they're definitely in the annual guidance there. And we think there will be â as I said in our prepared remarks, more a part of the software mix in the second half, especially later half of the year.
So, definitely, as Mike said, they're in market. I think there is early on, but nice traction. And so we'd expect to see more second half software activity from â I don't want to be specific to AT&T and Verizon, but those large transformations.
I mean, remember, we lose sight of the fact that BroadSoft in the â and these are huge projects, strategic projects for each of these carriers and there just aren't many companies that are able to do that magnitude of project â for the â a strategic application for Verizon, AT&T, Rogers, Deutsche Telekom all deliver in the same year. So these things are pretty profound and â but they're also very large organization so the timing, the financial impact, there's all a bit of part and ties (35:07) to it.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. That's it. I'll take the rest of such questions (35:15) â those questions offline. Regarding those two â customers (35:19) â I just want to ask one last question to Michael on Amazon Chime. If you have any color that you're willing to provide, we've heard that BroadSoft is now certified to be hosted in Amazon Cloud â AWS Cloud. You guys haven't really talked about any public cloud strategies just yet, actually what's coming down the pipe, but anything you could talk to about BroadSoft's activity with the public cloud than there's been specific to the Amazon Chime, and what you're seeing out there, to be incrementally positive for you or negative for you â and any way you want to explain, we'd love to hear your thoughts there?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure, Dmitry. Let me break that into two questions. So, the first one is, activities around public cloud. A number of our customers, I think one, very publicly, in case of Vonage which you guys (36:19) have been looking at moving their infrastructure to the public cloud, architectures or public cloud services like Amazon's. And we have been working with a number of the public cloud vendors to certify and ensure that the software that we provide, to companies like Vonage, runs, runs properly, we have the right performance, the right tuning, the right kind of the tuning of the application in those public clouds. So that they can perform to specifications and that we also understand their performance over time.
And so that's been a fairly extensive piece of work we've done as part of our overall kind of virtualization and then moving it to public cloud architectures. We assume that more and more or -a group of our carrier customers will look at moving their â not only their BroadSoft, but other applications into public cloud and that's what we're engaged with.
On the second question the Amazon announcement, I guess, I not only see it as a kind of a major change in the landscape of unified communications, pretty small application around the meeting space. I think the competitive landscape doesn't change for us in terms of full UC solution. We know who those competitors are; we're very aggressively competing with them in the market and being very successful. So I don't see the Amazon announcement as being very material.
Dmitry G. Netis - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thank you. Keep up the good work, guys.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Your line is open.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Oh, thank you for taking my question. Solid print there, one of mine is license revenue you reiterated the guide 7% to 10%, my question has to do with you know are you â what mechanisms are you taking to force the carriers off of BroadWorks and on to more your SaaS cloud platform. Could you go through some of the mechanics of that?
Are there other plans which we believe maybe there are plans â talking to the carriers that you possibly cap the next version of BroadWorks, so can you explain some of the dynamics there? Thank you.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure, Catharine. So I think that we've been â we announced a number of cloud offers in response to discussions with the service providers in an attempt to find the right mix with those operators to have some of them migrate obviously from software to cloud. And so we have offers which are â what I would â we call include everything, not only the applications but the OFS/DFS (39:33) all the ordering, provisioning, back office capabilities around our unified communication suite.
And we have a number of customers using that solution and we're also introducing as we talked about â a kind of a platform as a service offer which allows them to kind of reuse their back office and in kind of UX component (40:00) but move the BroadSoft â the BroadWorks component into cloud.
And so I think we're right now â we wouldn't say we have any program to stop supporting anything. We're really using these various offers and the advantages â what we believe for a lot of our customers of moving from software to cloud, faster time to market, lower overall operating costs for the platform, more resiliency, more security all of these things that we have invested significantly in our cloud infrastructure. These would become available to customers.
So I would say, the way I describe it to the folks is â it's a lot more carrot and stick in our strategy where we're really making some really great offers available. We're slowly working migration from software to cloud, but we don't have any kind of end of software support models.
We're also working with a number of customers on potentially how we might do some hybrid in the interim. How we might do both, BroadWorks on premise or in their network. And all the collaboration capabilities in the cloud that's clearly an interim step that we're working with a number of our customers on and obviously our new applications both CC-One and Team-One are cloud only. And so you know that's clearly a direction we're taking.
And I think generally, the last thing I would say is that the overall perception by our customers on cloud and faster time to market has been really great. I think people really understand it. They really get it, I think they're now sitting down with us and working on those transition plans.
Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks a lot, Mike, much appreciate the detail.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Thanks, Catharine.

Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Jim, I don't think you've given a number before, but what is the split between Tier 1 and non-Tier 1 revenue?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
For â give me a second, so I'd say for 2016 it was round numbers half â 50%, Tier 1; 50%, everybody else.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
What was the growth rate for the everybody else?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So the biggest growth was in Tier 1.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Can you split out in Tier-1 sales (43:25) what the growth rate was for one versus the other?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Just qualitatively, Paul that I think growth, I think we are seeing more concentrated growth in our largest customers.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
So you're not going to give us the numbers?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Correct.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
All right. Of the (43:50) transformation deals, are there any other transformation deals out there? If so, how many deals are in progress or up for grabs What should we expect over the next 12 months?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
It's good question. There are a fair amount of transformation, projects. I think we've talked about in the past that we're not going to â I guess continue to report on individuals. Some of them are obviously smaller geos â in smaller geographies, smaller operators. We're seeing generally the desire by most of the carriers we're engaged with to standardize on single platform and to and to slowly consolidate. So there are a fair number of those projects. I don't have a number, Paul, off the top of my head.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
And I would just add Paul that it's sort of on a few different vectors, but especially outside the U.S. When we win one major opco, you have the opportunity and you kind of in the driver seat for a subsequent opcos in a group. And so, again, I think given how our transformation wins with several, European, a major operator. You'll see us continuing to do transformation work for those groups as we go â as those opcos go through transformation.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Right.
Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thank you. I'll pass it over. Thanks.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
And just â and one, I wanted to do one quick correction, sorry â Norah asked me on long-term SaaS. And I said, north of 70% and I should've said the target between 60% and 70% long-term gross margin on SaaS.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Yun - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. This is Brian Yun, on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you talked about North America quite a bit. But could you just give us a little bit more color on what you might be seeing in EMEA, APAC or even the emerging markets? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, actually. So, 2016 was a really good year outside of the U.S. in particular â particularly in Europe as a â sort of tie-in to Paul's question, Europe does tend to be a bit more of a Tier 1-focused geography for us. But we saw really good sell-through in Europe, really good license growth â and growth in cloud.
Asia-Pacific continues to be a strong market for us particularly, Australia and Korea. We had nice growth on a cloud basis in Japan, but it's on a small base. And then actually interestingly enough, although a small geography, CALA had a really nice growth. And particularly in Mexico, so Mexico is actually our sixth-largest geography worldwide, it's a pretty nice market for us.
Brian Yun - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. Then follow-up question, could you give us some insight on new recent feature announcements on UC-One specifically, I saw that you announced AI and Apple CallKit support for bMobile, so what was the driver for these additional feature rollouts, were the mobile operators asking for these?
And then how does this position you versus your competitors. Is it a pretty major differentiator or, are these features apart from the course (48:15) of this plan? Thanks.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Right. So just quick, I mean, we're very active with the mobile operator community right now, bolt â as I mentioned before, bolt-on, on fixed mobile conversion launches and mobile-only launches, and you'll see a number of enhancements that we'll talk about as time goes on.
I think when you look at competitively, we're in a very unique position with mobile operators and unified communication. We're really the only folks that really bring UC and the mobile core together, and that's why we have very strong positioning in that base. The â in particular, iOS 10 CallKit is â enables a better user experience for VoIP calls or IP calls on your Apple device as compared to the previously. So with some enhancements that Apple did in the latest iOS, which made it a lot better in terms of the user experience, as calls come into your mobile device. And that's the announcement we made just recently.
Brian Yun - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Michael A. Kerlan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys, it's Mike on for Jess. Nice quarter. Just go back to geos, you gave some great color there. Can you just provide what the sales contribution was for each of the markets?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yes, so revenue for 2016 North America, $193 million; EMEA, $98 million; and emerging, $50 million. For the quarter, round numbers, North America, $59 million; EMEA, $28 million; emerging, $12 million.
Michael A. Kerlan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. And then just on the competitive dynamic, can you talk about what impact you're seeing from Avaya's Chapter 11 filing. Is this creating incremental opportunity to target the Avaya base?
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah I think we're clearly seeing fair amount of interest due to the Avaya bankruptcy. I mean, first of all I'd say that the event for Avaya really highlight and it's just another data point in this transformation from premise to cloud. So it's pretty clear that it's a strategy that's staying, it's a strategy we bet on the company, and its clearly where the industry is going. And those that are in the legacy premise-based marketplace will struggle as Avaya has over the last couple of years.
I think what we're seeing now with this kind of announcement of the bankruptcy announcement, and restructuring is a large number of Avaya channels looking for alternate supply and so there's fair amount of activity in that market, generally looking at what they should recommend to their customers, Avaya had a fairly large number of channels in a number of geos and so we are seeing a fair amount of inbound activity looking at our technologies to those resellers and channels.
The second thing that we're engaged with is, we're actually â we're working with a number of those operators on building go-to-market programs and campaigns to target and to educate the end-user community on the options of moving to cloud communications, how they might do that, what are the various paths to migrate. And I think it's also important to realize that Avaya served a fairly diverse set of customers, from small customers, SMB customers with their IP Office product to very, very large enterprises globally with their larger UC platforms. And so, we're engaged with a number of the â of our partners on out-bounding and educating the end-users about the choices they have.
I think what we're going to see is that this will really create a starting point where end-users will start to process to reevaluate their Avaya solutions and start to figure out how they transform off those premise-based solutions and so we'll see a net positive, if you like in the transformation, the overall transformation picture from premise to cloud.
Michael A. Kerlan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then, just lastly, as far as the Q1 guide goes, it sounds like there's really strong tailwinds with the business on a lot of different areas. Is the Q1 outlook â does it just reflect just normal seasonality and the fact that's kind of â it tends to be a lumpy business in general, and it's usually stronger in the second half? Just in general, how are you thinking about just the overall trends going into Q1, or we just â Street too aggressive modeling sales there? Is there just normal seasonality?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. So, yeah, I view Q1 â Q1 feels right now to me very normal and tone of the business (54:35) solid. We had a big Q4 and going into Q1 as I said earlier, to an earlier question, and I think the cadence looks a little bit more like prior years. We did have particularly strong Q1 last year, so that comps are just, I think, optically a little tougher. So, yeah, I think we're in a â I think it feels solid.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Yeah. I add just a little color there. Many of our larger operators look at their budget time lines go well into Q1. So it's not unusual for us to see Q1 being a little late.
Michael A. Kerlan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the final question will come from Mike Latimore of Northland Capital. Your line is open.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Yeah, great. Thanks. Just a question on the migrations. And what do you think would be the main catalyst to see more wide scale migrations? Would it be more, just IT work by the carriers themselves, or some other factor?
And then secondly, as it relates to the end-user business customers, what kind of work do they have to do on their end if they're going to shift over to your platform. Do they have to buy new phones or do IT work themselves? I guess, those are the two questions there.
Michael Tessler - BroadSoft, Inc.
Good two questions. A little bit of everything. So what we're doing with a number of those operators is exactly that is, we're looking at the legacy base. We're parsing that base into number of offers. Some offers are â I would say, invisible to the end-user where we migrate, we're not really changing the experience. In some cases, we're changing the experience a little bit, i.e. some new devices, but the overall package might be similar. And in some cases we're up-selling a complete unified communication solution.
And so I think that's the first work that we've already done with a number of operators, is that an up-sell, is it a transparent migration, is it kind of transparent, so there's some work to be done by the end user.
And then you're absolutely correct. There's a series of IT works that's required, testing, validation kind of walking through the various procedures to make sure that the customer transformations are effective. So anyhow, if we're doing an up-sell to different buyer journey then â if it's a â in the night transparent migration, and so all that work needs to be done. And I think that that's where we're heavily engaged with the number of those transformation partners working through those strategies and then implementations.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
And I might have missed it, but what was the SaaS number in a quarter?
James Tholen - BroadSoft, Inc.
So SaaS number was $14 million â yeah, $14.1 million.
Mike J. Latimore - Northland Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thank you.
Operator
